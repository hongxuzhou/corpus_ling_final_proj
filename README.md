This repo is for the final assignment of the course Corpus Linguistics at the University of Groningen. 
As a prominent contemporary author, Neil Gaiman has produced a substantial body of work spanning diverse genres and targeting audiences ranging from children to adults. This project employs corpus-driven methods to analyse potential stylistic variations in Gaiman's writing that may distinguish works intended for different reader demographics. Through systematic linguistic analysis, the study aims to identify and characterize textual features that differentiate Gaiman's writing across audience-targeted works.
Through this project, I will focus on practising the workflow in R environment from scratch to ultimate reporting. 
The corpora are stored in two ways:
* `RDS` as the main format
* `TSV` as general backup
