AB_ch1	AB	Anansi Boys	1	6675	37248	CHAPTER ONEWHICH IS MOSTLY ABOUT NAMES AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPSIt begins, as most things begin, with a song.In the beginning, after all, were the words, and they came with a tune. That was how the world was made, how the void was divided, how the lands and the stars and the dreams and the little gods and the animals, how all of them came into the world.They were sung.The great beasts were sung into existence, after the Singer had done with the planets and the hills and the trees and the oceans and the lesser beasts. The cliffs that bound existence were sung, and the hunting grounds, and the dark.Songs remain. They last. The right song can turn an emperor into a laughingstock, can bring down dynasties. A song can last long after the events and the people in it are dust and dreams and gone. That's the power of songs.There are other things you can do with songs. They do not only make worlds or recreate existence. Fat Charlie Nancy's father, for example, was simply using them to have what he hoped and expected would be a marvelous night out.Before Fat Charlie's father had come into the bar, the barman had been of the opinion that the whole karaoke evening was going to be an utter bust; but then the little old man had sashayed into the room, walked past the table of several blonde women with the fresh sunburns and smiles of tourists, who were sitting by the little makeshift stage in the corner. He had tipped his hat to them, for he wore a hat, a spotless green fedora, and lemon-yellow gloves, and then he walked over to their table. They giggled.""Are you enjoyin' yourselves, ladies?"" he asked.They continued to giggle and told him they were having a good time, thank you, and that they were here on vacation. He said to them, it gets better, just you wait.He was older than they were, much, much older, but he was charm itself, like something from a bygone age when fine manners and courtly gestures were worth something. The barman relaxed. With someone like this in the bar, it was going to be a good evening.There was karaoke. There was dancing. The old man got up to sing, on the makeshift stage, not once, that evening, but twice. He had a fine voice, and an excellent smile, and feet that twinkled when he danced. The first time he got up to sing, he sang ""What's New Pussycat?"" The second time he got up to sing, he ruined Fat Charlie's life.Fat Charlie was only ever fat for a handful of years, from shortly before the age of ten, which was when his mother announced to the world that if there was one thing she was over and done with (and if the gentleman in question had any argument with it he could just stick it you know where) it was her marriage to that elderly goat that she had made the unfortunate mistake of marrying and she would be leaving in the morning for somewhere a long way away and he had better not try to follow, to the age of fourteen, when Fat Charlie grew a bit and exercised a little more. He was not fat. Truth to tell, he was not really even chubby, simply slightly soft-looking around the edges. But the name Fat Charlie clung to him, like chewing gum to the sole of a tennis shoe. He would introduce himself as Charles or, in his early twenties, Chaz, or, in writing, as C. Nancy, but it was no use: the name would creep in, infiltrating the new part of his life just as cockroaches invade the cracks and the world behind the fridge in a new kitchen, and like it or not - and he didn't - he would be Fat Charlie again.It was, he knew, irrationally, because his father had given him the nickname, and when his father gave things names, they stuck.There was a dog who had lived in the house across the way, in the Florida street on which Fat Charlie had grown up. It was a chestnut-colored boxer, long-legged and pointy-eared with a face that looked like the beast had, as a puppy, run face-first into a wall. Its head was raised, its tail nub erect. It was, unmistakably, an aristocrat amongst canines. It had entered dog shows. It had rosettes for Best of Breed and for Best in Class and even one rosette marked Best in Show. This dog rejoiced in the name of Campbell's Macinrory Arbuthnot the Seventh, and its owners, when they were feeling familiar, called it Kai. This lasted until the day that Fat Charlie's father, sitting out on their dilapidated porch swing, sipping his beer, noticed the dog as it ambled back and forth across the neighbor's yard, on a leash that ran from a palm tree to a fence post.""Hell of a goofy dog,"" said Fat Charlie's father. ""Like that friend of Donald Duck's. Hey Goofy.""And what once had been Best in Show suddenly slipped and shifted. For Fat Charlie, it was as if he saw the dog through his father's eyes, and darned if he wasn't a pretty goofy dog, all things considered. Almost rubbery.It didn't take long for the name to spread up and down the street. Campbell's Macinrory Arbuthnot the Seventh's owners struggled with it, but they might as well have stood their ground and argued with a hurricane. Total strangers would pat the once proud boxer's head, and say, ""Hello, Goofy. How's a boy?"" The dog's owners stopped entering him in dog shows soon after that. They didn't have the heart. ""Goofy-looking dog,"" said the judges.Fat Charlie's father's names for things stuck. That was just how it was.That was far from the worst thing about Fat Charlie's father.There had been, during the years that Fat Charlie was growing up, a number of candidates for the worst thing about his father: his roving eye and equally as adventurous fingers, at least according to the young ladies of the area, who would complain to Fat Charlie's mother, and then there would be trouble; the little black cigarillos, which he called cheroots, which he smoked, the smell of which clung to everything he touched; his fondness for a peculiar shuffling form of tap dancing only ever fashionable, Fat Charlie suspected, for half an hour in Harlem in the1920 s; his total and invincible ignorance about current world affairs, combined with his apparent conviction that sitcoms were half-hour-long insights into the lives and struggles of real people. These, individually, as far as Fat Charlie was concerned, were none of them the worst thing about Fat Charlie's father, although each of them had contributed to the worst thing.The worst thing about Fat Charlie's father was simply this: He was embarrassing.Of course, everyone's parents are embarrassing. It goes with the territory. The nature of parents is to embarrass merely by existing, just as it is the nature of children of a certain age to cringe with embarrassment, shame, and mortification should their parents so much as speak to them on the street.Fat Charlie's father, of course, had elevated this to an art form, and he rejoiced in it, just as he rejoiced in practical jokes, from the simple - Fat Charlie would never forget the first time he had climbed into an apple-pie bed - to the unimaginably complex.""Like what?"" asked Rosie, Fat Charlie's fiancée, one evening, when Fat Charlie, who normally did not talk about his father, had attempted, stumblingly, to explain why he believed that simply inviting his father to their upcoming wedding would be a horrendously bad idea. They were in a small wine bar in South London at the time. Fat Charlie had long been of the opinion that four thousand miles and the Atlantic Ocean were both good things to keep between himself and his father.""Well-"" said Fat Charlie, and he remembered a parade of indignities, each one of which made his toes curl involuntarily. He settled upon one of them. ""Well, when I changed schools, when I was a kid, my dad made a point of telling me how much he had always looked forward to Presidents' Day, when he was a boy, because it's the law that on Presidents' Day, the kids who go to school dressed as their favorite presidents get a big bag of candy.""""Oh. That's a nice law,"" said Rosie. ""I wish we had something like that in England."" Rosie had never been out of the U.K., if you didn't count a Club18 -30 holiday to an island in, she was fairly certain, the Mediterranean. She had warm brown eyes and a good heart, even if geography was not her strongest suit.""It's not a nice law,"" said Fat Charlie. ""It's not a law at all. He made it up. Most states don't even have school on Presidents' Day, and even for the ones that do, there is no tradition of going to school on Presidents' Day dressed as your favorite president. Kids dressed as presidents do not get big bags of candy by an act of Congress, nor is your popularity in the years ahead, all through middle school and high school, decided entirely by which president you decided to dress as - the average kids dress as the obvious presidents, the Lincolns and Washingtons and Jeffersons, but the ones who would become popular, they dressed as John Quincy Adams or Warren Gamaliel Harding, or someone like that. And it's bad luck to talk about it before the day. Or rather it isn't, but he said it was.""""Boys and girls dress up as presidents?""""Oh yes. Boys and girls. So I spent the week before Presidents' Day reading everything there was to read about presidents in the World Book Encyclopedia, trying to choose the right one.""""Didn't you ever suspect that he was pulling your leg?""Fat Charlie shook his head. ""It's not something you think about, when my dad starts to work you over. He's the finest liar you'll ever meet. He's convincing.""Rosie took a sip of her Chardonnay. ""So which President did you go to school as?""""Taft. He was the twenty-seventh president. I wore a brown suit my father had found somewhere, with the legs all rolled up and a pillow stuffed down the front. I had a painted-on moustache. My dad took me to school himself that day. I walked in so proudly. The other kids just screamed and pointed, and somewhere in there I locked myself in a cubicle in the boys' room and cried. They wouldn't let me go home to change. I went through the day like that. It was Hell.""""You should have made something up,"" said Rosie. ""You were going to a costume party afterwards or something. Or just told them the truth.""""Yeah,"" said Fat Charlie meaningfully and gloomily, remembering.""What did your dad say, when you got home?""""Oh, he hooted with laughter. Chuckled and chortled and, and chittered and all that. Then he told me that maybe they didn't do that Presidents' Day stuff anymore. Now, why didn't we go down to the beach together and look for mermaids?""""Look for - mermaids?""""We'd go down to the beach, and walk along it, and he'd be as embarrassing as any human being on the face of this planet has ever been - he'd start singing, and he'd start doing a shuffling sort of sand-dance on the sand, and he'd just talk to people as he went - people he didn't even know, people he'd never met, and I hated it, except he told me there were mermaids out there in the Atlantic, and if I looked fast enough and sharp enough, I'd see one."" 'There!' he'd say. 'Did you see her? She was a big ol' redhead, with a green tail.' And I looked, and I looked, but I never did.""He shook his head. Then he took a handful of mixed nuts from the bowl on the table and began to toss them into his mouth, chomping down on them as if each nut was a twenty-year-old indignity that could never be erased.""Well,"" said Rosie, brightly, ""I think he sounds lovely, a real character! We have to get him to come over for the wedding. He'd be the life and soul of the party.""Which, Fat Charlie explained, after briefly choking on a Brazil nut, was really the last thing you wanted at your wedding, after all, wasn't it, your father turning up and being the life and soul of the party? He said that his father was, he had no doubt, still the most embarrassing person on God's Green Earth. He added that he was perfectly happy not to have seen the old goat for several years, and that the best thing his mother ever did was to leave his father and come to England to stay with her Aunt Alanna. He buttressed this by stating categorically that he was damned, double-damned, and quite possibly even thrice-damned if he was going to invite his father. In fact, said Fat Charlie in closing, the best thing about getting married was not having to invite his dad to their wedding.And then Fat Charlie saw the expression on Rosie's face and the icy glint in her normally friendly eyes, and he corrected himself hurriedly, explaining that he meant the second-best, but it was already much too late.""You'll just have to get used to the idea,"" said Rosie. ""After all, a wedding is a marvelous opportunity for mending fences and building bridges. It's your opportunity to show him that there are no hard feelings.""""But there are hard feelings,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Lots.""""Do you have an address for him?"" asked Rosie. ""Or a phone number? You probably ought to phone him. A letter's a bit impersonal when your only son is getting married- you are his only son, aren't you? Does he have e-mail?""""Yes. I'm his only son. I have no idea if he has e-mail or not. Probably not,"" said Fat Charlie. Letters were good things, he thought. They could get lost in the post for a start.""Well, you must have an address or a phone number.""""I don't,"" said Fat Charlie, honestly. Maybe his father had moved away. He could have left Florida and gone somewhere they didn't have telephones. Or addresses.""Well,"" said Rosie, sharply, ""who does?""""Mrs. Higgler,"" said Fat Charlie, and all the fight went out of him.Rosie smiled sweetly. ""And who is Mrs. Higgler?"" she asked.""Friend of the family,"" said Fat Charlie. ""When I was growing up, she used to live next door.""He had spoken to Mrs. Higgler several years earlier, when his mother was dying. He had, at his mother's request, telephoned Mrs. Higgler to pass on the message to Fat Charlie's father, and to tell him to get in touch. And several days later there had been a message on Fat Charlie's answering machine, left while he was at work, in a voice that was unmistakably his father's, even if it did sound rather older and a little drunk.His father said that it was not a good time, and that business affairs would be keeping him in America. And then he added that, for everything, Fat Charlie's mother was a damn fine woman. Several days later a vase of assorted flowers had been delivered to the hospital ward. Fat Charlie's mother had snorted when she read the card.""Thinks he can get around me that easily?"" she said. ""He's got another think coming, I can tell you that."" But she had had the nurse put the flowers in a place of honor by her bed and, several times since, had asked Fat Charlie if he had heard anything about his father coming and visiting her before it was all over.Fat Charlie said he hadn't. He grew to hate the question, and his answer, and the expression on her face when he told her that, no, his father wasn't coming.The worst day, in Fat Charlie's opinion, was the day that the doctor, a gruff little man, had taken Fat Charlie aside and told him that it would not be long now, that his mother was fading fast, and it had become a matter of keeping her comfortable until the end.Fat Charlie had nodded, and gone in to his mother. She had held his hand, and was asking him whether or not he had remembered to pay her gas bill, when the noise began in the corridor - a clashing, parping, stomping, rattling, brass-and-bass-and-drum sort of noise, of the kind that tends not to be heard in hospitals, where signs in the stairwells request quiet and the icy glares of the nursing staff enforce it.The noise was getting louder.For one moment Fat Charlie thought it might be terrorists. His mother, though, smiled weakly at the cacophony. ""Yellow bird,"" she whispered.""What?"" said Fat Charlie, scared that she had stopped making sense."" 'Yellow Bird,' "" she said, louder and more firmly. ""It's what they're playing.""Fat Charlie went to the door, and looked out.Coming down the hospital corridor, ignoring the protests of nurses, the stares of patients in pajamas and of their families, was what appeared to be a very small New Orleans jazz band. There was a saxophone and a sousaphone and a trumpet. There was an enormous man with what looked like a double bass strung around his neck. There was a man with a bass drum, which he banged. And at the head of the pack, in a smart checked suit, wearing a fedora hat and lemon yellow gloves, came Fat Charlie's father. He played no instrument but was doing a soft-shoe-shuffle along the polished linoleum of the hospital floor, lifting his hat to each of the medical staff in turn, shaking hands with anyone who got close enough to talk or to attempt to complain.Fat Charlie bit his lip, and prayed to anyone who might be listening that the earth would open and swallow him up or, failing that, that he might suffer a brief, merciful and entirely fatal heart attack. No such luck. He remained among the living, the brass band kept coming, his father kept dancing and shaking hands and smiling.If there is any justice in the world, thought Fat Charlie, my father will keep going down the corridor, and he'll go straight past us and into the genito-urinary department; however, there was no justice, and his father reached the door of the oncology ward and stopped.""Fat Charlie,"" he said, loudly enough that everyone in the ward - on that floor - in the hospital - was able to comprehend that this was someone who knew Fat Charlie. ""Fat Charlie, get out of the way. Your father is here.""Fat Charlie got out of the way.The band, led by Fat Charlie's father, snaked their way through the ward to Fat Charlie's mother's bed. She looked up at them as they approached, and she smiled."" 'Yellow Bird,' "" she said, weakly. ""It's my favorite song.""""And what kind of man would I be if I forgot that?"" asked Fat Charlie's father.She shook her head slowly, and she reached out her hand and squeezed his hand in its lemon yellow glove.""Excuse me,"" said a small white woman with a clipboard, ""are these people with you?""""No,"" said Fat Charlie, his cheeks heating up. ""They're not. Not really.""""But that is your mother, isn't it?"" said the woman, with a basilisk glance. ""I must ask you to make these people vacate the ward momentarily, and without incurring any further disturbance.""Fat Charlie muttered.""What was that?""""I said, I'm pretty sure I can't make them do anything,"" said Fat Charlie. He was consoling himself that things could not possibly get any worse, when his father took a plastic carrier bag from the drummer and began producing cans of brown ale and handing them out to his band, to the nursing staff, to the patients. Then he lit a cheroot.""Excuse me,"" said the woman with the clipboard, when she saw the smoke, and she launched herself across the room at Fat Charlie's father like a Scud missile with its watch on upside down.Fat Charlie took that moment to slip away. It seemed the wisest course of action.He sat at home that night, waiting for the phone to ring or for a knock on the door, in much the same spirit that a man kneeling at the guillotine might wait for the blade to kiss his neck; still, the doorbell did not ring.He barely slept, and slunk in to the hospital the following afternoon prepared for the worst.His mother, in her bed, looked happier and more comfortable than she had looked in months. ""He's gone back,"" she told Fat Charlie, when he came in. ""He couldn't stay. I have to say, Charlie, I do wish you hadn't just gone like that. We wound up having a party here. We had a fine old time.""Fat Charlie could think of nothing worse than having to attend a party in a cancer ward, thrown by his father with a jazz band. He didn't say anything.""He's not a bad man,"" said Fat Charlie's mother, with a twinkle in her eye. Then she frowned. ""Well, that's not exactly true. He's certainly not a good man. But he did me a power of good last night,"" and she smiled, a real smile and, for just a moment, looked young again.The woman with the clipboard was standing in the doorway, and she crooked her finger at him. Fat Charlie beetled down the ward toward her, apologizing before she was even properly within earshot. Her look, he realized, as he got closer to her, was no longer that of a basilisk with stomach cramps. Now she looked positively kittenish. ""Your father,"" she said.""I'm sorry,"" said Fat Charlie. It was what he had always said, growing up, when his father was mentioned.""No, no, no,"" said the former basilisk. ""Nothing to apologize for. I was just wondering. Your father. In case we need to get in touch with him - we don't have a telephone number or an address on file. I should have asked him last night, but it completely got away from me.""""I don't think he has a phone number,"" said Fat Charlie. ""And the best way to find him is to go to Florida, and to drive up Highway A1A - that's the coast road that runs up most of the east of the state. In the afternoon you may find him fishing off a bridge. In the evening he'll be in a bar.""""Such a charming man,"" she said, wistfully. ""What does he do?""""I told you. He says it's the miracle of the loafs and the fishes.""She stared at him blankly, and he felt stupid. When his father said it, people would laugh. ""Um. Like in the Bible. The miracle of the loaves and the fishes. Dad used to say that he loafs and fishes, and it's a miracle that he still makes money. It was a sort of joke.""A misty look. ""Yes. He told the funniest jokes."" She clucked her tongue, and once more was all business. ""Now, I need you back here at five-thirty.""""Why?""""To pick up your mother. And her belongings. Didn't Dr. Johnson tell you we were discharging her?""""You're sending her home?""""Yes, Mr. Nancy.""""What about the, about the cancer?""""It seems to have been a false alarm.""Fat Charlie couldn't understand how it could have been a false alarm. Last week they'd been talking about sending his mother to a hospice. The doctor had been using phrases like ""weeks not months"" and ""making her as comfortable as possible while we wait for the inevitable.""Still, Fat Charlie came back at 5:30 and picked up his mother, who seemed quite unsurprised to learn that she was no longer dying. On the way home she told Fat Charlie that she would be using her life savings to travel around the world.""The doctors were saying I had three months,"" she said. ""And I remember I thought, if I get out of this hospital bed then I'm going to see Paris and Rome and places like that. I'm going back to Barbados, and to Saint Andrews. I may go to Africa. And China. I like Chinese food.""Fat Charlie wasn't sure what was going on, but whatever it was, he blamed his father. He accompanied his mother and a serious suitcase to Heathrow Airport, and waved her good-bye at the international departures gate. She was smiling hugely as she went through, clutching her passport and tickets, and she looked younger than he remembered her looking in many years.She sent him postcards from Paris, and from Rome and from Athens, and from Lagos and Cape Town. Her postcard from Nanking told him that she certainly didn't like what passed for Chinese food in China, and that she couldn't wait to come back to London and eat proper Chinese food.She died in her sleep in a hotel in Williamstown, on the Caribbean island of Saint Andrews.At the funeral, at a South London crematorium, Fat Charlie kept expecting to see his father: perhaps the old man would make an entrance at the head of a jazz band, or be followed down the aisle by a clown troupe or a half-dozen tricycle-riding, cigar-puffing chimpanzees; even during the service Fat Charlie kept glancing back, over his shoulder, toward the chapel door. But Fat Charlie's father was not there, only his mother's friends and distant relations, mostly big women in black hats, blowing their noses and dabbing at their eyes and shaking their heads.It was during the final hymn, after the button had been pressed and Fat Charlie's mother had trundled off down the conveyor belt to her final reward, that Fat Charlie noticed a man of about his own age standing at the back of the chapel. It was not his father, obviously. It was someone he did not know, someone he might not even have noticed, at the back, in the shadows, had he not been looking for his father- and then there was the stranger, in an elegant black suit, his eyes lowered, his hands folded.Fat Charlie let his glance linger a moment too long, and the stranger looked at Fat Charlie and flashed him a joyless smile of the kind that suggested that they were both in this together. It was not the kind of expression you see on the faces of strangers, but still, Fat Charlie could not place the man. He turned his face back to the front of the chapel. They sang ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" a song Fat Charlie was pretty sure his mother had always disliked, and the Reverend Wright invited them back to Fat Charlie's Great-Aunt Alanna's for something to eat.There was nobody at his Great-Aunt Alanna's whom he did not already know. In the years since his mother had died, he sometimes wondered about that stranger: who he was, why he was there. Sometimes Fat Charlie thought that he had simply imagined him-""So,"" said Rosie, draining her Chardonnay, ""you'll call your Mrs. Higgler and give her my mobile number. Tell her about the wedding and the date- that's a thought: do you think we should invite her?""""We can if we like,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I don't think she'll come. She's an old family friend. She knew my dad back in the dark ages.""""Well, sound her out. See if we should send her an invitation.""Rosie was a good person. There was in Rosie a little of the essence of Francis of Assisi, of Robin Hood, of Buddha and of Glinda the Good: the knowledge that she was about to bring together her true love and his estranged father gave her forthcoming wedding an extra dimension, she decided. It was no longer simply a wedding: it was now practically a humanitarian mission, and Fat Charlie had known Rosie long enough to know never to stand between his fiancée and her need to Do Good.""I'll call Mrs. Higgler tomorrow,"" he said.""Tell you what,"" said Rosie, with an endearing wrinkle of her nose, ""call her tonight. It's not late in America, after all.""Fat Charlie nodded. They walked out of the wine bar together, Rosie with a spring in her step, Fat Charlie like a man going to the gallows. He told himself not to be silly: After all, perhaps Mrs. Higgler had moved, or had her phone disconnected. It was possible. Anything was possible.They went up to Fat Charlie's place, the upstairs half of a smallish house in Maxwell Gardens, just off the Brixton Road.""What time is it in Florida?"" Rosie asked.""Late afternoon,"" said Fat Charlie.""Well. Go on then.""""Maybe we should wait a bit. In case she's out.""""And maybe we should call now, before she has her dinner.""Fat Charlie found his old paper address book, and under H was a scrap of an envelope, in his mother's handwriting, with a telephone number on it, and beneath that, Callyanne Higgler.The phone rang and rang.""She's not there,"" he said to Rosie, but at that moment the phone at the other end was answered, and a female voice said ""Yes? Who is this?""""Um. Is that Mrs. Higgler?""""Who is this?"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""If you're one of they damn telemarketers, you take me off your list right now or I sue. I know my rights.""""No. It's me. Charles Nancy. I used to live next door to you.""""Fat Charlie? If that don't beat all. I been looking for your number all this morning. I turn this place upside down, looking for it, and you think I could find it? What I think happen was I had it written in my old accounts book. Upside down I turn the place. And I say to myself, Callyanne, this is a good time to just pray and hope the Lord hear you and see you right, and I went down on my knees, well, my knees are not so good any more, so I just put my hands together, but anyway, I still don't find your number, but look at how you just phone me up, and that's even better from some points of view, particularly because I ain't made of money and I can't afford to go phoning no foreign countries even for something like this, although I was going to phone you, don't you worry, given the circumstances-""And she stopped, suddenly, either to take a breath, or to take a sip from the huge mug of too-hot coffee she always carried in her left hand, and during the brief quiet Fat Charlie said, ""I want to ask my dad to come to my wedding. Getting married."" There was silence at the end of the line. ""It's not till the end of the year, though,"" he said. Still silence. ""Her name's Rosie,"" he added, helpfully. He was starting to wonder if they had been cut off; conversations with Mrs. Higgler were normally somewhat one-sided affairs, often with her doing your lines for you, and here she was, letting him say three whole things uninterrupted. He decided to go for a fourth. ""You can come too if you want,"" he said.""Lord, lord, lord,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""Nobody tell you?""""Told me what?""So she told him, at length and in detail, while he stood there and said nothing at all, and when she was done he said ""Thank you, Mrs. Higgler."" He wrote something down on a scrap of paper, then he said, ""Thanks. No, really, thanks,"" again, and he put down the phone.""Well?"" asked Rosie. ""Have you got his number?""Fat Charlie said, ""Dad won't be coming to the wedding."" Then he said, ""I have to go to Florida."" His voice was flat, and without emotion. He might have been saying, ""I have to order a new checkbook.""""When?""""Tomorrow.""""Why?""""Funeral. My dad's. He's dead.""""Oh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" She put her arms around him, and held him. He stood in her arms like a shop-window dummy. ""How did it, did he- was he ill?""Fat Charlie shook his head. ""I don't want to talk about it,"" he said.And Rosie squeezed him tightly, and then she nodded, sympathetically, and let him go. She thought he was too overcome with grief to talk about it.He wasn't. That wasn't it at all. He was too embarrassed.There must be a hundred thousand respectable ways to die. Leaping off a bridge into a river to save a small child from drowning, for example, or being mown down in a hail of bullets while single-handedly storming a nest of criminals. Perfectly respectable ways to die.Truth to tell, there were even some less-than-respectable ways to die that wouldn't have been so bad. Spontaneous human combustion, for example: it's medically dodgy and scientifically unlikely, but even so, people persist in going up in smoke, leaving nothing behind but a charred hand still clutching an unfinished cigarette. Fat Charlie had read about it in a magazine: he wouldn't have minded if his father had gone like that. Or even if he'd had a heart attack running down the street after the men who had stolen his beer money.This is how Fat Charlie's father died.He had arrived in the bar early, and had launched the karaoke evening by singing ""What's New Pussycat?"" which song he had belted out, according to Mrs. Higgler, who had not been there, in a manner that would have caused Tom Jones to be festooned in flung feminine undergarments, and which brought Fat Charlie's father a complimentary beer, courtesy of the several blonde tourists from Michigan who thought he was just about the cutest thing they'd ever seen.""It was their fault,"" said Mrs. Higgler, bitterly, over the phone. ""They was encouragin' him!"" They were women who had squeezed into tube tops, and they had reddish too-much-sun-too-early tans, and they were all young enough to be his daughters.So pretty soon he's down at their table, smoking his cheroots and hinting strongly that he was in Army Intelligence during the war, although he was careful not to say which war, and that he could kill a man in a dozen different ways with his bare hands without breaking a sweat.Now he takes the bustiest and blondest of the tourists on a quick spin around the dance floor, such as it was, while one of her friends warbled ""Strangers in the Night"" from the stage. He appeared to be having a fine time, although the tourist was somewhat taller than he was, and his grin was on a level with her bosom.And then, the dance done, he announced it was his turn again, and, because if there was one thing you could say about Fat Charlie's father it was that he was secure in his heterosexuality, he sang ""I Am What I Am"" to the room, but particularly to the blondest tourist on the table just below him. He gave it everything he had. He had just got as far as explaining to anyone listening that as far as he was concerned his life would not actually be worth a damn unless he was able to tell everybody that he was what he was, when he made an odd face, pressed one hand to his chest, stretched the other hand out, and toppled, as slowly and as gracefully as a man could topple, off the makeshift stage and onto the blondest holidaymaker, and from her onto the floor.""It was how he always would have wanted to go,"" sighed Mrs. Higgler.And then she told Fat Charlie how his father had, with his final gesture, as he fell, reached out and grasped at something, which turned out to be the blonde tourist's tube top, so that at first some people thought he had made a lust-driven leap from the stage with the sole purpose of exposing the bosom in question, because there she was, screaming, with her breasts staring at the room, while the music for ""I Am What I Am"" kept playing, only now without anyone singing.When the onlookers realized what had actually happened they had two minutes' silence, and Fat Charlie's father was carried out and put into an ambulance while the blonde tourist had hysterics in the ladies' room.It was the breasts that Fat Charlie couldn't get out of his head. In his mind's eye they followed him accusatively around the room, like the eyes in a painting. He kept wanting to apologize to a roomful of people he had never met. And the knowledge that his father would have found it hugely amusing simply added to Fat Charlie's mortification. It's worse when you're embarrassed about something you were not even there to see: your mind keeps embroidering the events and going back to it and turning it over and over, and examining it from every side. Well, yours might not, but Fat Charlie's certainly did.As a rule, Fat Charlie felt embarrassment in his teeth, and in the upper pit of his stomach. If something that even looked like it might be embarrassing was about to happen on his television screen Fat Charlie would leap up and turn it off. If that was not possible, say if other people were present, he would leave the room on some pretext and wait until the moment of embarrassment was sure to be over.Fat Charlie lived in South London. He had arrived, at the age of ten, with an American accent, which he had been relentlessly teased about, and had worked very hard to lose, finally extirpating the last of the soft consonants and rich Rs while learning the correct use and placement of the word innit. He had finally succeeded in losing his American accent for good as he had turned sixteen, just as his schoolfriends discovered that they needed very badly to sound like they came from the 'hood. Soon all of them except Fat Charlie sounded like people who wanted to sound like Fat Charlie had talked when he'd come to England in the first place, except that he could never have used language like that in public without his mum giving him a swift clout round the ear.It was all in the voice.Once the embarrassment over his father's method of passing began to fade, Fat Charlie just felt empty.""I don't have any family,"" he said to Rosie, almost petulantly.""You've got me,"" she said. That made Fat Charlie smile. ""And you've got my mum,"" she added, which stopped the smile in its tracks. She kissed him on the cheek.""You could stay over for the night,"" he suggested. ""Comfort me, all that.""""I could,"" she agreed, ""but I'm not going to.""Rosie was not going to sleep with Fat Charlie until they were married. She said it was her decision, and she had made it when she was fifteen; not that she had known Fat Charlie then, but she had decided. So she gave him another hug, a long one. And she said, ""You need to make your peace with your dad, you know."" And then she went home.He spent a restless night, sleeping sometimes, then waking, and wondering, and falling back asleep again.He was up at sunrise. When people got in to work he would ring his travel agent and ask about bereavement fares to Florida, and he would phone the Grahame Coats Agency and tell them that, due to a death in the family, he would have to take a few days off and yes, he knew it came out of his sick leave or his holiday time. But for now he was glad that the world was quiet.He went along the corridor to the tiny spare room at the back of the house and looked down into the gardens below. The dawn chorus had begun, and he could see blackbirds, and small hedge-hopping sparrows, a single spotted-breasted thrush in the boughs of a nearby tree. Fat Charlie thought that a world in which birds sang in the morning was a normal world, a sensible world, a world he didn't mind being a part of.Later, when birds were something to be afraid of, Fat Charlie would still remember that morning as something good and something fine, but also as the place where it all started. Before the madness; before the fear.
AB_ch2	AB	Anansi Boys	2	6333	34919	CHAPTER TWOWHICH IS MOSTLY ABOUT THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN AFTER FUNERALSFat Charlie puffed his way through the Memorial Garden of Rest, squinting at the Florida sunshine. Sweat stains were spreading across his suit, beginning with the armpits and the chest. Sweat began to pour down his face as he ran.The Memorial Garden of Rest did, in fact, look very much like a garden, but a very odd garden, in which all the flowers were artificial, and they grew from metal vases protruding from metal plaques set in the ground. Fat Charlie ran past a sign: ""FREE Burial Space for all Honorably Discharged Veterans!"" it said. He ran through Babyland, where multicolored windmills and sodden blue and pink teddy bears joined the artificial flowers on the Florida turf. A moldering Winnie the Pooh stared up wanly at the blue sky.Fat Charlie could see the funeral party now, and he changed direction, finding a path that allowed him to run toward it. There were thirty people, perhaps more, standing around the grave. The women wore dark dresses, and big black hats trimmed with black lace, like fabulous flowers. The men wore suits without sweat stains. The children looked solemn. Fat Charlie slowed his pace to a respectful walk, still trying to hurry without moving fast enough for anyone to notice that he was in fact hurrying, and, having reached the group of mourners, he attempted to edge his way to the front ranks without attracting too much attention. Seeing that by now he was panting like a walrus who had just had to tackle a flight of stairs, was dripping with sweat and trod on several feet as he went by, this attempt proved a failure.There were glares, which Fat Charlie tried to pretend he did not notice. Everyone was singing a song that Fat Charlie did not know. He moved his head in time with the song and tried to make it look as if he was sort of singing, moving his lips in a way that might have meant that he was actively singing along, sotto voce, and he might have been muttering a prayer under his breath, and might just have been random lip motion. He took the opportunity to look down at the casket. He was pleased to see that it was closed.The casket was a glorious thing, made of what looked like heavy-duty reinforced steel, gunmetal gray. In the event of the glorious resurrection, thought Fat Charlie, when Gabriel blows his mighty horn and the dead escape their coffins, his father was going to be stuck in his grave, banging away futilely at the lid, wishing that he had been buried with a crowbar and possibly an oxyacetylene torch.A final, deeply melodic hallelujah faded away. In the silence that followed, Fat Charlie could hear someone shouting at the other end of the memorial gardens, back near where he had come in.The preacher said, ""Now, does anyone have anything they want to say in memory of the dear departed?""By the expressions on the faces of those nearest to the grave, it was obvious that several of them were planning to say things. But Fat Charlie knew it was a now-or-never moment. You need to make your peace with your dad, you know. Right.He took a deep breath and a step forward, so he was right at the edge of the grave, and he said ""Um. Excuse me. Right. I think I have something to say.""The distant shouting was getting louder. Several of the mourners were casting glances back over their shoulders, to see where it was coming from. The rest of them were staring at Fat Charlie.""I was never what you would call close to my father,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I suppose we didn't really know how. I've not been part of his life for twenty years, and he hasn't been part of mine. There's a lot of things it's hard to forgive, but then one day you turn around and you've got no family left."" He wiped a hand across his forehead. ""I don't think I've ever said 'I love you, Dad' in my whole life. All of you, you all probably knew him better than I did. Some of you may have loved him. You were part of his life, and I wasn't. So I'm not ashamed that any of you should hear me say it. Say it for the first time in at least twenty years."" He looked down at the impregnable metal casket lid. ""I love you,"" he said. ""And I'll never forget you.""The shouting got even louder, and now it was loud enough and clear enough, in the silence that followed Fat Charlie's statement, for everyone to be able to make out the words being bellowed across the memorial gardens: ""Fat Charlie! You stop botherin' those people and get your ass over here this minute!""Fat Charlie stared at the sea of unfamiliar faces, their expressions a seething stew of shock, puzzlement, anger and horror; ears burning, he realized the truth.""Er. Sorry. Wrong funeral,"" he said.A small boy with big ears and an enormous smile said, proudly, ""That was my gramma.""Fat Charlie backed through the small crowd mumbling barely coherent apologies. He wanted the world to end now. He knew it was not his father's fault, but also knew that his father would have found it hilarious.Standing on the path, her hands on her hips, was a large woman with gray hair and thunder in her face. Fat Charlie walked toward her as he would have walked across a minefield, nine years old again, and in trouble.""You don't hear me yellin?"" she asked. ""You went right on past me. Makin' a embarrassment of yourself!"" The way she said embarrassment it began with the letter H. ""Back this way,"" she said. ""You miss the service and everythin'. But there's a shovelful of dirt waiting for you.""Mrs. Higgler had barely changed in the last two decades: she was a little fatter, a little grayer. Her lips were pressed tightly together, and she led the way down one of the memorial garden's many paths. Fat Charlie suspected that he had not made the best possible first impression. She led the way and, in disgrace, Fat Charlie followed.A lizard zapped up one of the struts of the metal fence at the edge of the memorial garden, then poised itself at the top of a spike, tasting the thick Florida air. The sun had gone behind a cloud, but, if anything, the afternoon was getting hotter. The lizard puffed its neck out into a bright orange balloon.Two long-legged cranes he had taken initially for lawn ornaments looked up at him as he passed. One of them darted its head down and rose up again with a large frog dangling from its beak. It began, in a series of gulping movements, to try to swallow the frog, which kicked and flailed in the air.""Come on,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""Don't dawdle. Bad enough you missing your own father's funeral.""Fat Charlie suppressed the urge to say something about having come four thousand miles already that day, and having rented a car and driven down from Orlando, and how he had got off at the wrong exit, and whose idea was it anyway to tuck a garden of rest behind a Wal-Mart on the very edge of town? They kept walking, past a large concrete building that smelled of formaldehyde, until they reached an open grave at the very farthest reaches of the property. There was nothing beyond this but a high fence, and, beyond that, a wilderness of trees and palms and greenery. In the grave was a modest wooden coffin. It had several mounds of dirt on it already. Beside the grave was a pile of earth and a shovel.Mrs. Higgler picked up the shovel and handed it to Fat Charlie.""It was a pretty service,"" she said. ""Some of your daddy's old drinkin' buddies were there, and all the ladies from our street. Even after he moved down the road we still kept in touch. He would have liked it. Of course, he would have liked it more if you'd been there."" She shook her head. ""Now, shovel,"" she said. ""And if you got any good-byes, you can say them while you're shovelin' down the dirt.""""I thought I was just meant to do one or two spadefuls of dirt,"" he said. ""To show willing.""""I give the man thirty bucks to go away,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""I tell him that the departed's son is flying in all the way from Hingland, and that he would want to do right by his father. Do the right thing. Not just 'show willing.'""""Right,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Absolutely. Got it."" He took off his suit jacket and hung it on the fence. He loosened his tie, pulled it over his head, and put it into the jacket pocket. He shoveled the black dirt into the open grave, in Florida air as thick as soup.After a while it sort of began to rain, which is to say that it was the kind of rain that never comes to a decision about whether it's actually raining or not. Driving in it, you would never have been certain whether or not to turn on your wipers. Standing in it, shoveling in it, you simply got sweatier, damper, more uncomfortable. Fat Charlie continued to shovel, and Mrs. Higgler stood there with her arms folded across her gargantuan bosom, with the almost-rain misting her black dress and her straw hat with one black silk rose on it, watching him as he filled in the hole.The earth became mud, and became, if anything, heavier.After what seemed like a lifetime, and a very uncomfortable one at that, Fat Charlie patted down the final shovelful of dirt.Mrs. Higgler walked over to him. She took his jacket off the fence and handed it to him.""You're soaked to the skin and covered in dirt and sweat, but you grew up. Welcome home, Fat Charlie,"" she said, and she smiled, and she held him to her vast breast.""I'm not crying,"" said Fat Charlie.""Hush now,"" said Mrs. Higgler.""It's the rain on my face,"" said Fat Charlie.Mrs. Higgler didn't say anything. She just held him, and swayed backward and forward, and after a while Fat Charlie said, ""It's okay. I'm better now.""""There's food back at my house,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""Let's get you fed.""He wiped the mud from his shoes in the parking lot, then he got into his gray rental car, and he followed Mrs. Higgler in her maroon station wagon down streets that had not existed twenty years earlier. Mrs. Higgler drove like a woman who had just discovered an enormous and much-needed mug of coffee and whose primary mission was to drink as much coffee as she was able to while driving as fast as possible; and Fat Charlie drove along behind her, keeping up as best he could, racing from traffic light to traffic light while trying to figure out more or less where they were.And then they turned down a street, and, with mounting apprehension, he realized he recognized it. This was the street he had lived on as a boy. Even the houses looked more or less the same, although most of them had now grown impressive wire-mesh fences around their front yards.There were several cars already parked in front of Mrs. Higgler's house. He pulled up behind an elderly gray Ford. Mrs. Higgler walked up to the front door, opened it with her key.Fat Charlie looked down at himself, muddy and sweat-soaked. ""I can't go in looking like this,"" he said.""I seen worse,"" said Mrs. Higgler. Then she sniffed. ""I tell you what, you go in there, go straight into the bathroom, you can wash off your hands and face, clean yourself up, and when you're ready we'll all be in the kitchen.""He went into the bathroom. Everything smelled like jasmine. He took off his muddy shirt, and washed his face and hands with jasmine-scented soap, in a tiny washbasin. He took a washcloth and wiped down his chest, and scrubbed at the muddiest lumps on his suit trousers. He looked at the shirt, which had been white when he put it on this morning and was now a particularly grubby brown, and decided not to put it back on. He had more shirts in his bag, in the backseat of the rental car. He would slip back out of the house, put on a clean shirt, then face the people in the house.He unlocked the bathroom door, and opened it.Four elderly ladies were standing in the corridor, staring at him. He knew them. He knew all of them.""What you doing now?"" asked Mrs. Higgler.""Changing shirt,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Shirt in car. Yes. Back soon.""He raised his chin high, and strode down the corridor and out of the front door.""What kind of language was that he was talkin?"" asked little Mrs. Dunwiddy, behind his back, loudly.""That's not something you see every day,"" said Mrs. Bustamonte, although, this being Florida's Treasure Coast, if there was something you did see every day, it was topless men, although not usually with muddy suit trousers on.Fat Charlie changed his shirt by the car, and went back into the house. The four ladies were in the kitchen, industriously packing away into Tupperware containers what looked like it had until recently been a large spread of food.Mrs. Higgler was older than Mrs. Bustamonte, and both of them were older than Miss Noles, and none of them was older than Mrs. Dunwiddy. Mrs. Dunwiddy was old, and she looked it. There were geological ages that were probably younger than Mrs. Dunwiddy.As a boy, Fat Charlie had imagined Mrs. Dunwiddy in Equatorial Africa, peering disapprovingly though her thick spectacles at the newly erect hominids. ""Keep out of my front yard,"" she would tell a recently evolved and rather nervous specimen of Homo habilis, ""or I going to belt you around your ear hole, I can tell you."" Mrs. Dunwiddy smelled of violet water and beneath the violets she smelled of very old woman indeed. She was a tiny old lady who could outglare a thunderstorm, and Fat Charlie, who had, over two decades ago, followed a lost tennis ball into her yard, and then broken one of her lawn ornaments, was still quite terrified of her.Right now, Mrs. Dunwiddy was eating lumps of curry goat with her fingers from a small Tupperware bowl. ""Pity to waste it,"" she said, and dropped the bits of goat bone into a china saucer.""Time for you to eat, Fat Charlie?"" asked Miss Noles.""I'm fine,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Honest.""Four pairs of eyes stared at him reproachfully through four pairs of spectacles. ""No good starvin' yourself in your grief,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy, licking her fingertips, and picking out another brown fatty lump of goat.""I'm not. I'm just not hungry. That's all.""""Misery going to shrivel you away to pure skin and bones,"" said Miss Noles, with gloomy relish.""I don't think it will.""""I putting a plate together for you at the table over there,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""You go and sit down now. I don't want to hear another word out of you. There's more of everything, so don't you worry about that.""Fat Charlie sat down where she pointed, and within seconds there was placed in front of him a plate piled high with stew peas and rice, and sweet potato pudding, jerk pork, curry goat, curry chicken, fried plantains, and a pickled cow foot. Fat Charlie could feel the heartburn beginning, and he had not even put anything in his mouth yet.""Where's everyone else?"" he said.""Your daddy's drinking buddies, they gone off drinking. They going to have a memorial fishing trip off a bridge, in his memory."" Mrs. Higgler poured the remaining coffee out of her bucket-sized traveling mug into the sink and replaced it with the steaming contents of a freshly brewed jug of coffee.Mrs. Dunwiddy licked her fingers clean with a small purple tongue, and she shuffled over to where Fat Charlie was sitting, his food as yet untouched. When he was a little boy he had truly believed that Mrs. Dunwiddy was a witch. Not a nice witch, more the kind kids had to push into ovens to escape from. This was the first time he'd seen her in more than twenty years, and he was still having to quell an inner urge to yelp and hide under the table.""I seen plenty people die,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy. ""In my time. Get old enough, you will see it your own self too. Everybody going to be dead one day, just give them time."" She paused. ""Still. I never thought it would happen to your daddy."" And she shook her head.""What was he like?"" asked Fat Charlie. ""When he was young?""Mrs. Dunwiddy looked at him through her thick, thick spectacles, and her lips pursed, and she shook her head. ""Before my time,"" was all she said. ""Eat your cow foot.""Fat Charlie sighed, and he began to eat.It was late afternoon, and they were alone in the house.""Where you going to sleep tonight?"" asked Mrs. Higgler.""I thought I'd get a motel room,"" said Fat Charlie.""When you got a perfectly good bedroom here? And a perfectly good house down the road. You haven't even looked at it yet. You ask me, your father would have wanted you to stay there.""""I'd rather be on my own. And I don't think I feel right about sleeping at my dad's place.""""Well, it's not my money I'm throwin' away,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""You're goin' to have to decide what you're goin' to do with your father's house anyway. And all his things.""""I don't care,"" said Fat Charlie. ""We could have a garage sale. Put them on eBay. Haul them to the dump.""""Now, what kind of an attitude is that?"" She rummaged in a kitchen drawer and pulled out a front door key with a large paper label attached to it. ""He give me a spare key when he move,"" she said. ""In case he lose his, or lock it inside, or something. He used to say, he could forget his head if it wasn't attached to his neck. When he sell the house next door, he tell me, don't you worry, Callyanne, I won't go far; he'd live in that house as long as I remember, but now he decide it's too big and he need to move house- "" and still talking she walked him down to the curb and drove them down several streets in her maroon station wagon, until they reached a one-story wooden house.She unlocked the front door and they went inside.The smell was familiar: faintly sweet, as if chocolate chip cookies had been baked there the last time the kitchen was used, but that had been a long time ago. It was too hot in there. Mrs. Higgler led them into the little sitting room, and she turned on a window-fitted air-conditioning unit. It rattled and shook, and smelled like a wet sheepdog, and moved the warm air around.There were stacks of books piled around a decrepit sofa Fat Charlie remembered from his childhood, and there were photographs in frames: one, in black-and-white, of Fat Charlie's mother when she was young, with her hair up on top of her head all black and shiny, wearing a sparkly dress; beside it, a photo of Fat Charlie himself, aged perhaps five or six years old, standing beside a mirrored door, so it looked at first glance as if two little Fat Charlies, side by side, were staring seriously out of the photograph at you.Fat Charlie picked up the top book in the pile. It was a book on Italian architecture.""Was he interested in architecture?""""Passionate about it. Yes.""""I didn't know that.""Mrs. Higgler shrugged and sipped her coffee.Fat Charlie opened the book and saw his father's name neatly written on the first page. He closed the book.""I never knew him,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Not really.""""He was never an easy man to know,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""I knew him for what, nearly sixty years? And I didn't know him.""""You must have known him when he was a boy.""Mrs. Higgler hesitated. She seemed to be remembering. Then she said, very quietly, ""I knew him when I was a girl.""Fat Charlie felt that he should be changing the subject, so he pointed to the photo of his mother. ""He's got Mum's picture there,"" he said.Mrs Higgler took a slurp of her coffee. ""Them take it on a boat,"" she said. ""Back before you was born. One of those boats that you had dinner on, and they would sail out three miles, out of territorial waters, and then there was gamblin'. Then they come back. I don't know if they still run those boats. Your mother say it was the first time she ever eat steak.""Fat Charlie tried to imagine what his parents had been like before he was born.""He always was a good-looking man,"" mused Mrs. Higgler, as if she were reading his mind. ""All the way to the end. He had a smile that could make a girl squeeze her toes. And he was always such a very fine dresser. All the ladies loved him.""Fat Charlie knew the answer before he asked the question. ""Did you-?""""What kind of a question is that to be asking a respectable widow-woman?"" She sipped her coffee. Fat Charlie waited for the answer. She said, ""I kissed him. Long, long time ago, before he ever met your mother. He was a fine, fine kisser. I hoped that he'd call, take me dancing again, instead he vanish. He was gone for what, a year? Two years? And by the time he come back, I was married to Mr. Higgler, and he's bringing back your mother. Is out on the islands he meet her.""""Were you upset?""""I was a married woman."" Another sip of coffee. ""And you couldn't hate him. Couldn't even be properly angry with him. And the way he look at her - damn, if he did ever look at me like that I could have died happy. You know, at their wedding, is me was your mother's matron of honor?""""I didn't know.""The air-conditioning unit was starting to bellow out cold air. It still smelled like a wet sheepdog.He asked, ""Do you think they were happy?""""In the beginning."" She hefted her huge thermal mug, seemed about to take a sip of coffee and then changed her mind. ""In the beginning. But not even she could keep his attention for very long. He had so much to do. He was very busy, your father.""Fat Charlie tried to work out if Mrs. Higgler was joking or not. He couldn't tell. She didn't smile, though.""So much to do? Like what? Fish off bridges? Play dominoes on the porch? Await the inevitable invention of karaoke? He wasn't busy. I don't think he ever did a day's work in all the time I knew him.""""You shouldn't say that about your father!""""Well, it's true. He was crap. A rotten husband and a rotten father.""""Of course he was!"" said Mrs Higgler, fiercely, ""But you can't judge him like you would judge a man. You got to remember, Fat Charlie, that your father was a god.""""A god among men?""""No. Just a god."" She said it without any kind of emphasis, as flatly and as normally as she might have said ""he was diabetic"" or simply ""he was black.""Fat Charlie wanted to make a joke of it, but there was that look in Mrs. Higgler's eyes, and suddenly he couldn't think of anything funny to say. So he said, softly, ""He wasn't a god. Gods are special. Mythical. They do miracles and things.""""That's right,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""We wouldn't have told you while he was alive, but now he is gone, there can't be any harm in it.""""He was not a god. He was my dad.""""You can be both,"" she said. ""It happens.""It was like arguing with a crazy person, thought Fat Charlie. He realized that he should just shut up, but his mouth kept going. Right now his mouth was saying, ""Look. If my dad was a god, he would have had godlike powers.""""He did. Never did a lot with them, mind you. But he was old. Anyway, how do you think he got away with not working? Whenever he needed money, he'd play the lottery, or go down to Hallendale and bet on the dogs or the horses. Never win enough to attract attention. Just enough to get by.""Fat Charlie had never won anything in his whole life. Nothing whatsoever. In the various office sweepstakes he had taken part in, he was only able to rely on his horse never making it out of the starting gate, or his team being relegated to some hitherto unheard-of division somewhere in the elephants' graveyard of organized sport. It rankled.""If my dad was a god - something which I do not for one moment concede in any way, I should add - then why aren't I a god too? I mean, you're saying I'm the son of a god, aren't you?""""Obviously.""""Well then, why can't I bet on winning horses or do magic or miracles or things?""She sniffed. ""Your brother got all that god stuff.""Fat Charlie found that he was smiling. He breathed out. It was a joke after all, then.""Ah. You know, Mrs. Higgler, I don't actually have a brother.""""Of course you do. That's you and him, in the photograph.""Although he knew what was in it, Fat Charlie glanced over at the photograph. She was mad all right. Absolutely barking. ""Mrs. Higgler,"" he said, as gently as possible. ""That'sme. Just me when I was a kid. It's a mirrored door. I'm standing next to it. It's me, and my reflection.""""It is you, and it is also your brother.""""I never had a brother.""""Sure you did. I don't miss him. You were always the good one, you know. He was a handful when he was here."" And before Fat Charlie could say anything else she added, ""He went away, when you are just a little boy.""Fat Charlie leaned over. He put his big hand on Mrs. Higgler's bony hand, the one that wasn't holding the coffee mug. ""It's not true,"" he said.""Louella Dunwiddy made him go,"" she said. ""He was scared of her. But he still came back, from time to time. He could be charming when he wanted to be."" She finished her coffee.""I always wanted a brother,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Somebody to play with.""Mrs. Higgler got up. ""This place isn't going to clean itself up,"" she said. ""I've got garbage bags in the car. I figure we'll need a lot of garbage bags.""""Yes,"" said Fat Charlie.He stayed in a motel that night. In the morning, he and Mrs. Higgler met, back at his father's house, and they put garbage into big black garbage bags. They assembled bags of objects to be donated to Goodwill. They also filled a box with things Fat Charlie wanted to hold on to for sentimental reasons, mostly photographs from his childhood and before he was born.There was an old trunk, like a small pirate's treasure chest, filled with documents and old papers. Fat Charlie sat on the floor going through them. Mrs. Higgler came in from the bedroom with another black garbage bag filled with moth-eaten clothes.""It's your brother give him that trunk,"" said Mrs. Higgler, out of the blue. It was the first time she had mentioned any of her fantasies of the previous night.""I wish I did have a brother,"" said Fat Charlie, and he did not realize he had said it aloud until Mrs. Higgler said, ""I already told you. You do have a brother.""""So,"" he said. ""Where would I find this mythical brother of mine?"" Later, he would wonder why he had asked her this. Was he humoring her? Teasing her? Was it just that he had to say something to fill the void? Whatever the reason, he said it. And she was chewing her lower lip, and nodding.""You got to know. It's your heritage. It's your bloodline."" She walked over to him and crooked her finger. Fat Charlie bent down. The old woman's lips brushed his ear as she whispered, ""- need him- tell a-""""What?""""I say,"" she said, in her normal voice, ""if you need him, just tell a spider. He'll come running.""""Tell a spider?""""That's what I said. You think I just talkin' for my health? Exercisin' my lungs? You never hear of talkin' to the bees? When I was a girl in Saint Andrews, before my folks came here, you would go tell the bees all your good news. Well, this is just like that. Talk to spider. It was how I used to send messages to your father, when he would vanish off.""""- right.""""Don't you say 'right' like that.""""Like what?""""Like I'm a crazy old lady who don't know the price of fish. You think I don't know which way is up?""""Um. I'm quite sure you do. Honestly.""Mrs. Higgler was not mollified. She was far from gruntled. She picked up her coffee mug from the table and cradled it, disapprovingly. Fat Charlie had done it now, and Mrs. Higgler was determined to make sure that he knew it.""I don't got to do this, you know,"" she said. ""I don't got to help you. I'm only doing it because your father, he was special, and because your mother, she was a fine woman. I'm telling you big things. I'm telling you important things. You should listen to me. You should believe me.""""I do believe you,"" said Fat Charlie, as convincingly as he could.""Now you're just humoring an old woman.""""No,"" he lied. ""I'm not. Honestly I'm not."" His words rang with honesty, sincerity and truth. He was thousands of miles from home, in his late father's house, with a crazy old woman on the verge of an apoplectic seizure. He would have told her that the moon was just some kind of unusual tropical fruit if it would have calmed her down, and meant it, as best he could.She sniffed.""That's the trouble with you young people,"" she said. ""You think because you ain't been here long, you know everything. In my life I already forget more than you ever know. You don't know nothin' about your father, you don't know nothin' about your family. I tell you your father is a god, you don't even ask me what god I talking about.""Fat Charlie tried to remember the names of some gods. ""Zeus?"" he suggested.Mrs. Higgler made a noise like a kettle suppressing the urge to boil. Fat Charlie was fairly sure that Zeus had been the wrong answer. ""Cupid?""She made another noise, which began as a sputter and ended in a giggle. ""I can just picture your dad wearing nothin' but one of them fluffy diapers, with a big bow and arrow."" She giggled some more. Then she swallowed some coffee.""Back when he was a god,"" she told him. ""Back then, they called him Anansi.""Now, probably you know some Anansi stories. Probably there's no one in the whole wide world doesn't know some Anansi stories.Anansi was a spider, when the world was young, and all the stories were being told for the first time. He used to get himself into trouble, and he used to get himself out of trouble. The story of the Tar-Baby, the one they tell about Bre'r Rabbit? That was Anansi's story first. Some people thinks he was a rabbit. But that's their mistake. He wasn't a rabbit. He was a spider.Anansi stories go back as long as people been telling each other stories. Back in Africa, where everything began, even before people were painting cave lions and bears on rock walls, even then they were telling stories, about monkeys and lions and buffalo: big dream stories. People always had those proclivities. That was how they made sense of their worlds. Everything that ran or crawled or swung or snaked got to walk through those stories, and different tribes of people would venerate different creatures.Lion was the king of beasts, even then, and Gazelle was the fleetest of foot, and Monkey was the most foolish, and Tiger was the most terrible, but it wasn't stories about them people wanted to hear.Anansi gave his name to stories. Every story is Anansi's. Once, before the stories were Anansi's, they all belonged to Tiger (which is the name the people of the islands call all the big cats), and the tales were dark and evil, and filled with pain, and none of them ended happily. But that was a long time ago. These days, the stories are Anansi's.Seeing we were just at a funeral, let me tell you a story about Anansi, the time his grandmother died. (It's okay: she was a very old woman, and she went in her sleep. It happens.) She died a long way from home, so Anansi, he goes across the island with his handcart, and he gets his grandmother's body, and puts it on the handcart, and he wheels it home. He's going to bury her by the banyan tree out the back of his hut, you see.Now, he's passing through the town, after pushing his grandmother's corpse in the cart all morning, and he thinks I need some whisky. So he goes into the shop, for there is a shop in that village, a store that sells everything, where the shopkeeper is a very hasty-tempered man. Anansi, he goes in and he drinks some whisky. He drinks a little more whisky, and he thinks, I shall play a trick on this fellow, so he says to the shopkeeper, go take some whisky to my grandmother, sleeping in the cart outside. You may have to wake her, for she's a sound sleeper.So the shopkeeper, he goes out to the cart with a bottle, and he says to the old lady in the cart, ""Hey, here's your whisky,"" but the old lady she not say anything. And the shopkeeper, he's just getting angrier and angrier, for he was such a hasty-tempered man, saying get up, old woman, get up and drink your whisky, but the old woman she says nothing. Then she does something that the dead sometimes do in the heat of the day: she flatulates loudly. Well, the shopkeeper, he's so angry with this old woman for flatulating at him that he hits her, and then he hits her again, and now he hits her one more time and she tumbles down from the handcart onto the ground.Anansi, he runs out and he starts a-crying and a-wailing and a-carrying on, and saying my grandmother, she's a dead woman, look what you did! Murderer! Evildoer! Now the shopkeeper, he says to Anansi, don't you tell anyone I done this, and he gives Anansi five whole bottles of whisky, and a bag of gold, and a sack of plantains and pineapples and mangos, to make him hush his carrying-on, and to go away.(He thinks he killed Anansi's grandmother, you see.)So Anansi, he wheels his handcart home, and he buries his grandmother underneath the banyan tree.Now the next day, Tiger, he's passing by Anansi's house, and he smells cooking smells. So he invites himself over, and there's Anansi having a feast, and Anansi, having no other option, asks Tiger to sit and eat with them.Tiger says, Brother Anansi, where did you get all that fine food from, and don't you lie to me? And where did you get these bottles of whisky from, and that big bag filled with gold pieces? If you lie to me, I'll tear out your throat.So Anansi, he says, I cannot lie to you, Brother Tiger. I got them all for I take my dead grandmother to the village on a handcart. And the storekeeper gave me all these good things for bringing him my dead grandmother.Now, Tiger, he didn't have a living grandmother, but his wife had a mother, so he goes home and he calls his wife's mother out to see him, saying, grandmother, you come out now, for you and I must have a talk. And she comes out and peers around, and says what is it? Well, Tiger, he kills her, even though his wife loves her, and he places her body on a handcart.Then he wheels his handcart to the village, with his dead mother-in-law on it. Who want a dead body? he calls. Who want a dead grandmother? But all the people they just jeered at him, and they laughed at him, and they mocked him, and when they saw that he was serious and he wasn't going anywhere, they pelted him with rotten fruit until he ran away.It wasn't the first time Tiger was made a fool of by Anansi, and it wouldn't be the last time. Tiger's wife never let him forget how he killed her mother. Some days it's better for Tiger if he's never been born.That's an Anansi story.'Course, all stories are Anansi stories. Even this one.Olden days, all the animals wanted to have stories named after them, back in the days when the songs that sung the world were still being sung, back when they were still singing the sky and the rainbow and the ocean. It was in those days when animals were people as well as animals that Anansi the spider tricked all of them, especially Tiger, because he wanted all the stories named after him.Stories are like spiders, with all they long legs, and stories are like spiderwebs, which man gets himself all tangled up in but which look so pretty when you see them under a leaf in the morning dew, and in the elegant way that they connect to one another, each to each.What's that? You want to know if Anansi looked like a spider? Sure he did, except when he looked like a man.No, he never changed his shape. It's just a matter of how you tell the story. That's all.
AB_ch3	AB	Anansi Boys	3	5821	32890	CHAPTER THREEIN WHICH THERE IS A FAMILY REUNIONFat Charlie flew home to England; as home as he was going to get, anyway.Rosie was waiting for him as he came out of the customs hall carrying a small suitcase and a large, taped-up cardboard box. She gave him a huge hug. ""How was it?"" she asked.He shrugged. ""Could've been worse.""""Well,"" she said, ""at least you don't have to worry about him coming to the wedding and embarrassing you anymore.""""There is that.""""My mum says that we ought to put off the wedding for a few months as a mark of respect.""""Your mum just wants us to put off the wedding, full stop.""""Nonsense. She thinks you're quite a catch.""""Your mother wouldn't describe a combination of Brad Pitt, Bill Gates, and Prince William as 'quite a catch.' There is nobody walking the earth good enough to be her son-in-law.""""She likes you,"" said Rosie, dutifully, and without conviction.Rosie's mother did not like Fat Charlie, and everybody knew it. Rosie's mother was a high strung bundle of barely thought-through prejudices, worries, and feuds. She lived in a magnificent flat in Wimpole Street with nothing in the enormous fridge but bottles of vitaminized water and rye crackers. Wax fruit sat in the bowls on the antique sideboards and was dusted twice a week.Fat Charlie had, on his first visit to Rosie's mother's place, taken a bite from one of the wax apples. He had been extremely nervous, nervous enough that he had picked up an apple - in his defense, an extremely realistic apple - and had bitten into it. Rosie had signed frantically. Fat Charlie spat out the lump of wax into his hand and thought about pretending that he liked wax fruit, or that he'd known all along and had just done it to be funny; however, Rosie's mother had raised an eyebrow, walked over, taken the remains of the apple from him, explained shortly just how much real wax fruit cost these days, if you could find it, and then dropped the apple into the bin. He sat on the sofa for the rest of the afternoon with his mouth tasting like the inside of a candle, while Rosie's mother stared at him to ensure that he did not try to take another bite out of her precious wax fruit or attempt to gnaw on the leg of a Chippendale chair.There were large color photographs in silver frames on the sideboard of Rosie's mother's flat: photographs of Rosie as a girl and of Rosie's mother and father, and Fat Charlie had studied them intently, looking for clues to the mystery that was Rosie. Her father, who had died when Rosie was fifteen, had been an enormous man. He had been first a cook, then a chef, then a restaurateur. He was perfectly turned-out in every photograph, as if dressed by a wardrobe department before each shot, rotund and smiling, his arm always crooked for Rosie's mother to hold.""He was an amazing cook,"" Rosie said. In the photographs, Rosie's mother had been curvaceous and smiling. Now, twelve years on, she resembled a skeletal Eartha Kitt, and Fat Charlie had never seen her smile.""Does your mum ever cook?"" Fat Charlie had asked, after that first time.""I don't know. I've never seen her cook anything.""""What does she eat? I mean, she can't live on crackers and water.""Rosie said, ""I think she sends out for things.""Fat Charlie thought it highly likely that Rosie's mum went out at night in bat form to suck the blood from sleeping innocents. He had mentioned this theory to Rosie once, but she had failed to see the humor in it.Rosie's mother had told Rosie that she was certain that Fat Charlie was marrying her for her money.""What money?"" asked Rosie.Rosie's mother gestured to the apartment, a gesture that took in the wax fruit, the antique furniture, the paintings on the walls, and pursed her lips.""But this is all yours,"" said Rosie, who lived on her wages working for a London charity - and her wages were not large, so to supplement them Rosie had dipped into the money her father had left her in his will. It had paid for a small flat, which Rosie shared with a succession of Australians and New Zealanders, and for a secondhand VW Golf.""I won't live forever,"" sniffed her mother, in a way that implied that she had every intention of living forever, getting harder and thinner and more stonelike as she went, and eating less and less, until she would be able to live on nothing more than air and wax fruit and spite.Rosie, driving Fat Charlie home from Heathrow, decided that the subject should be changed. She said, ""The water's gone off in my flat. It's out in the whole building.""""Why's that then?""""Mrs. Klinger downstairs. She said something sprung a leak.""""Probably Mrs. Klinger.""""Charlie. So, I was wondering - could I take a bath at your place tonight?""""Do you need me to sponge you down?""""Charlie.""""Sure. Not a problem.""Rosie stared at the back of the car in front of her, then she took her hand off the gear stick and reached out and squeezed Fat Charlie's huge hand. ""We'll be married soon enough,"" she said.""I know,"" said Fat Charlie.""Well, I mean,"" she said. ""There'll be plenty of time for all that, won't there?""""Plenty,"" said Fat Charlie.""You know what my mum once said?"" said Rosie.""Er. Was it something about bringing back hanging?""""It was not. She said that if a just-married couple put a coin in a jar every time they make love in their first year, and take a coin out for every time that they make love in the years that follow, the jar will never be emptied.""""And this means-?""""Well,"" she said. ""It's interesting, isn't it? I'll be over at eight tonight with my rubber duck. How are you for towels?""""Um-""""I'll bring my own towel.""Fat Charlie did not believe it would be the end of the world if an occasional coin went into the jar before they tied the knot and sliced the wedding cake, but Rosie had her own opinions on the matter, and there the matter ended. The jar remained perfectly empty.The problem, Fat Charlie realized, once he got home, with arriving back in London after a brief trip away, is that if you arrive in the early morning, there is nothing much to do for the rest of the day.Fat Charlie was a man who preferred to be working. He regarded lying on a sofa watching Countdown as a reminder of his interludes as a member of the unemployed. He decided that the sensible thing to do would be to go back to work a day early. In the Aldwych offices of the Grahame Coats Agency, up on the fifth and topmost floor, he would feel part of the swim of things. There would be interesting conversation with his fellow workers in the tearoom. The whole panoply of life would unfold before him, majestic in its tapestry, implacable and relentless in its industry. People would be pleased to see him.""You're not back until tomorrow,"" said Annie the receptionist, when Fat Charlie walked in. ""I told people you wouldn't be back until tomorrow. When they phoned."" She was not amused.""Couldn't keep away,"" said Fat Charlie.""Obviously not,"" she said, with a sniff. ""You should phone Maeve Livingstone back. She's been calling every day.""""I thought she was one of Grahame Coats's people.""""Well, he wants you to talk to her. Hang on."" She picked up the phone.Grahame Coats came with both names. Not Mister Coats. Never just Grahame. It was his agency, and it represented people, and took a percentage of what they earned for the right to have represented them.Fat Charlie went back to his office, which was a tiny room he shared with a number of filing cabinets. There was a yellow Post-it note stuck to his computer screen with ""See me. GC"" on it, so he went down the hall to Grahame Coats's enormous office. The door was closed. He knocked and then, unsure if he had heard anyone say anything or not, opened the door and put his head inside.The room was empty. There was nobody there. ""Um, hello?"" said Fat Charlie, not very loudly. There was no reply. There was a certain amount of disarrangement in the room, however: the bookcase was sticking out of the wall at a peculiar angle, and from the space behind it he could hear a thumping sound that might have been hammering.He closed the door as quietly as he could and went back to his desk.His telephone rang. He picked it up.""Grahame Coats here. Come and see me.""This time Grahame Coats was sitting behind his desk, and the bookcase was flat against the wall. He did not invite Fat Charlie to sit down. He was a middle-aged white man with receding, very fair hair. If you happened to see Grahame Coats and immediately found yourself thinking of an albino ferret in an expensive suit, you would not be the first.""You're back with us, I see,"" said Grahame Coats. ""As it were.""""Yes,"" said Fat Charlie. Then, because Grahame Coats did not seem particularly pleased with Fat Charlie's early return, he added, ""Sorry.""Grahame Coats pinched his lips together, looked down at a paper on his desk, looked up again. ""I was given to understand that you were not, in fact, returning until tomorrow. Bit early, aren't we?""""We - I mean, I - got in this morning. From Florida. I thought I'd come in. Lots to do. Show willing. If that's all right.""""Absa-tively,"" said Grahame Coats. The word - a car crash between absolutely and positively - always set Fat Charlie's teeth on edge. ""It's your funeral.""""My father's, actually.""A ferretlike neck twist. ""You're still using one of your sick days.""""Right.""""Maeve Livingstone. Worried widow of Morris. Needs reassurance. Fair words and fine promises. Rome was not built in a day. The actual business of sorting out Morris Livingstone's estate and getting money to her continues unabated. Phones me practically daily for handholding. Meanwhilst, I turn the task over to you.""""Right,"" said Fat Charlie. ""So, um. No rest for the wicked.""""Another day, another dollar,"" said Grahame Coats, with a wag of his finger.""Nose to the grindstone?"" suggested Fat Charlie.""Shoulder to the wheel,"" said Grahame Coats. ""Well, delightful chatting with you. But we both have much work to do.""There was something about being in the vicinity of Grahame Coats that always made Fat Charlie (a) speak in clichés and (b) begin to daydream about huge black helicopters first opening fire upon, then dropping buckets of flaming napalm onto the offices of the Grahame Coats Agency. Fat Charlie would not be in the office in those daydreams. He would be sitting in a chair outside a little café on the other side of the Aldwych, sipping a frothy coffee and occasionally cheering at an exceptionally well-flung bucket of napalm.From this you would presume that there is little you need to know about Fat Charlie's employment, save that he was unhappy in it, and, in the main, you would be right. Fat Charlie had a facility for figures which kept him in work, and an awkwardness and a diffidence which kept him from pointing out to people what it was that he actually did, and how much he actually did. All about him, Fat Charlie would see people ascending implacably to their levels of incompetence, while he remained in entry-level positions, performing essential functions until the day he rejoined the ranks of the unemployed and started watching daytime television again. He was never out of a job for long, but it had happened far too often in the last decade for Fat Charlie to feel particularly comfortable in any position. He did not, however, take it personally.He telephoned Maeve Livingstone, widow of Morris Livingstone, once the most famous short Yorkshire comedian in Britain and a longtime client of the Grahame Coats Agency. ""Hullo,"" he said. ""This is Charles Nancy, from the accounts department of the Grahame Coats Agency.""""Oh,"" said a woman's voice at the other end of the line. ""I thought Grahame would be phoning me himself.""""He's a bit tied up. So he's um, delegated it,"" said Fat Charlie. ""To me. So. Can I help?""""I'm not sure. I was rather wondering - well, the bank manager was wondering - when the rest of the money from Morris's estate would be coming through. Grahame Coats explained to me, the last time - well, I think it was the last time - when we spoke - that it was invested - I mean, I understand that these things take time - he said otherwise I could lose a lot of money -""""Well,"" said Fat Charlie, ""I know he's on it. But these things do take time.""""Yes,"" she said. ""I suppose they must do. I called the BBC and they said they'd made several payments since Morris's death. You know, they've released the whole of Morris Livingstone, I Presume on DVD now? And they're bringing out both series of Short Back and Sides for Christmas.""""I didn't know,"" admitted Fat Charlie. ""But I'm sure Grahame Coats does. He's always on top of that kind of thing.""""I had to buy my own DVD,"" she said, wistfully. ""Still, it brought it all back. The roar of the greasepaint, the smell of the BBC club. Made me miss the spotlight, I can tell you that for nothing. That was how I met Morris, you know. I was a dancer. I had my own career.""Fat Charlie told her that he'd let Grahame Coats know that her bank manager was a bit concerned, and he put down the phone.He wondered how anyone could ever miss the spotlight.In Fat Charlie's worst nightmares, a spotlight shone down upon him from a dark sky onto a wide stage, and unseen figures would try to force Fat Charlie to stand in the spotlight and sing. And no matter how far or how fast he ran, or how well he hid, they would find him and drag him back onto the stage, in front of dozens of expectant faces. He would always awake before he actually had to sing, sweating and trembling, his heart beating a cannonade in his chest.A day's work passed. Fat Charlie had worked there almost two years. He had been there longer than anyone except Grahame Coats himself, for the staff turnover at the Grahame Coats Agency tended to be high. And still, nobody had been pleased to see him.Fat Charlie would sometimes sit at his desk and stare out of the window as the loveless gray rain rattled against the glass, and he would imagine himself on a tropical beach somewhere, with the breakers crashing from an impossibly blue sea onto the impossibly yellow sands. Often Fat Charlie would wonder if the people on the beach in his imagination, watching the white fingers of the waves as they wriggled toward the shore, listening to the tropical birds whistling in the palm trees, whether they ever dreamed of being in England, in the rain, in a cupboard-sized room in a fifth-floor office, a safe distance from the dullness of the pure golden sand and the hellish boredom of a day so perfect that not even a creamy drink containing slightly too much rum and a red paper umbrella can do anything to alleviate it. It comforted him.He stopped at the off-license on the way home and bought a bottle of German white wine, and a patchouli-scented candle from the tiny supermarket next door, and picked up a pizza from the Pizza Place nearby.Rosie phoned from her yoga class at 7:30 PM to let him know that she was going to be a little late, then from her car at 8:00 PM to let him know she was stuck in traffic, at 9:15 to let him know that she was now just around the corner, by which time Fat Charlie had drunk most of the bottle of white wine on his own, and consumed all but one lonely triangle of pizza.Later, he wondered if it was the wine that made him say it.Rosie arrived at 9:20, with towels, and a Tescos bag filled with shampoos, soaps, and a large pot of hair mayonnaise. She said no, briskly but cheerfully, to a glass of the white wine and the slice of pizza - she had, she explained, eaten in the traffic jam. She had ordered in. So Fat Charlie sat in the kitchen, and poured himself the final glass of white wine, and picked the cheese and the pepperoni from the top of the cold pizza while Rosie went off to run the bath and then started, suddenly and quite loudly, to scream.Fat Charlie made it to the bathroom before the first scream had finished dying away, and while Rosie was filling her lungs for the second. He was convinced that he would find her dripping with blood. To his surprise and relief, she was not bleeding. She was wearing a blue bra and panties, and was pointing to the bath, in the center of which sat a large brown garden spider.""I'm sorry,"" she wailed. ""It took me by surprise.""""They can do that,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I'll just wash it away.""""Don't you dare,"" said Rosie, fiercely. ""It's a living thing. Take it outside.""""Right,"" said Fat Charlie.""I'll wait in the kitchen,"" she said. ""Tell me when it's all over.""When you have drunk an entire bottle of white wine, coaxing a rather skittish garden spider into a clear plastic tumbler using only an old birthday card becomes more of a challenge to hand-eye coordination than it is at other times; a challenge that is not helped by a partially unclothed fiancée on the edge of hysterics, who, despite her announcement that she would wait in the kitchen, is instead leaning over your shoulder and offering advice.But soon enough, despite the help, he had the spider inside the tumbler, the mouth of which was firmly covered by a card from an old schoolfriend which told him that YOU ARE ONLY AS OLD AS YOU FEEL (and, on the inside humorously topped this with SO STOP FEELING YOURSELF YOU SEX MANIAC - HAPPY BIRTHDAY).He took the spider downstairs and out of the front door, into the tiny front garden, which consisted of a hedge, for people to throw up in, and several large flagstones with grass growing up between them. He held the tumbler up. In the yellow sodium light, the spider was black. He imagined it was staring at him.""Sorry about that,"" he said to the spider, and, white wine slooshing comfortably around inside him, he said it aloud.He put the card and the tumbler down on a cracked flagstone, and he lifted the tumbler, and waited for the spider to scuttle away. Instead, it simply sat, unmoving, on the face of the cheerful cartoon teddy bear on the birthday card. The man and the spider regarded each other.Something that Mrs. Higgler said came to him then, and the words were out of his mouth before he could stop them. Perhaps it was the devil in him. Probably it was the alcohol.""If you see my brother,"" said Fat Charlie to the spider, ""tell him he ought to come by and say hello.""The spider remained where it was, and raised one leg, almost as if it were thinking it over, then it scuttled across the flagstone toward the hedge, and was gone.Rosie had her bath, and she gave Fat Charlie a lingering peck on the cheek, and she went home.Fat Charlie turned on the TV, but he found himself nodding so he turned it off, and went to bed, where he dreamed a dream of such vividness and peculiarity that it would remain with him for the rest of his life.One way that you know something is a dream is that you are somewhere you have never been in real life. Fat Charlie had never been to California. He had never been to Beverly Hills. He had seen it enough, though, in movies and on television to feel a comfortable thrill of recognition. A party was going on.The lights of Los Angeles glimmered and twinkled beneath them.The people at the party seemed to divide neatly into the ones with the silver plates, covered with perfect canapés, and the ones who picked things off the silver plates, or who declined to. The ones who were being fed moved around the huge house gossiping, smiling, talking, each as certain of his or her relative importance in the world of Hollywood as were the courtiers in the court of ancient Japan - and, just as in the ancient Japanese court, each of them was certain that, just one rung up the ladder, they would be safe. There were actors who wished to be stars, stars who wanted to be independent producers, independent producers who craved the safety of a studio job, directors who wanted to be stars, studio bosses who wanted to be the bosses of other, less precarious studios, studio lawyers who wanted to be liked for themselves or, failing that, just wanted to be liked.In Fat Charlie's dream, he could see himself from inside and outside at the same time, and he was not himself. In Fat Charlie's usual dreams he was probably just sitting down for an exam on double-entry bookkeeping that he had forgotten to study for in circumstances which made it a certainty that when he finally stood up he would discover that he had somehow neglected to put anything on below the waist when he got dressed that morning. In his dreams, Fat Charlie was himself, only clumsier.Not in this dream.In this dream, Fat Charlie was cool, and beyond cool. He was slick, he was fly, he was smart, he was the only person at the party without a silver tray who had not received an invitation. And (this was something that was a source of astonishment to the sleeping Fat Charlie, who could think of nothing more embarrassing than being anywhere without an invitation) he was having a marvelous time.He told each person who asked him a different story about who he was and why he was there. After half an hour, most of the people at the party were convinced that he was the representative of a foreign investment house, seeking to buy outright one of the studios, and after another half an hour it was common knowledge at the party that he would be putting in a bid for Paramount.His laugh was raucous and infectious, and he seemed to be having a better time than any of the other people at the party, that was for certain. He instructed the barman in the preparation of a cocktail he called a ""Double Entendre"" which, while it seemed to begin with a base of champagne, he explained was actually scientifically nonalcoholic. It contained a splash of this and a splash of that until it went a vivid purple color, and he handed them out to the partygoers, pressing them upon them with joy and enthusiasm until even the people who had been sipping fizzy water warily, as if it might go off, were knocking back the purple drinks with pleasure.And then, with the logic of dreams, he was leading them all down to the pool, and was proposing to teach them the trick of Walking on the Water. It was all a matter of confidence, he told them, of attitude, of attack, of knowing how to do it. And it seemed to the people at the party that Walking on the Water would be a very fine trick to master, something they had always known how to do, deep down in their souls, but they had forgotten, and that this man would remind them of the technique of it.Take off your shoes,he said to them, so they took off their shoes, Sergio Rossis and Christian Louboutins and Renè Caovillas lined up side by side with Nikes and Doc Martens and anonymous black leather agent-shoes, and he led them, in a sort of a conga line, around the side of the swimming pool and then out onto its surface. The water was cool to the touch, and it quivered, like thick jelly, under their feet; some women, and several men, tittered at this, and a couple of the younger agents began jumping up and down on the surface of the pool, like children at a bouncy castle. Far below them the lights of Los Angeles shone through the smog, like distant galaxies.Soon every inch of the pool was taken up with partygoers - standing, dancing, shaking or bouncing up and down on the water. The press of the crowd was so strong that the fly guy, the Charlie-in-his-dream, stepped back onto the concrete poolside to take a falafel-sashimi ball from a silver plate.A spider dropped from a jasmine plant onto the fly guy's shoulder. It scuttled down his arm and onto the palm of his hand, where he greeted it with a delighted Heyyy.There was a silence, as if he was listening to something the spider was saying, something only he could hear; then he said, Ask, and you shall receive. Ain't that the truth?He placed the spider down, carefully, on a jasmine leaf.And at that selfsame moment, each of the people standing barefoot on the surface of the swimming pool remembered that water was a liquid, and not a solid, and that there was a reason why people did not commonly walk, let alone dance or even bounce, on water, viz., its impossibility.They were the movers and the shakers of the dream machine, those people, and suddenly they were flailing, fully dressed, in from four to twelve feet of water, wet and scrabbling and terrified.Casually, the fly guy walked across the pool, treading on the heads of people, and on the hands of other people, and never once losing his balance. Then, when he reached the far end of the pool, where everything dropped into a steep hill, he took one huge jump and dove into the lights of Los Angeles at night, which shimmered and swallowed him like an ocean.The people in the pool scrambled out, angry, upset, confused, wet, and in some cases, half-drowned-.It was early in the morning in South London. The light was blue-gray.Fat Charlie got out of bed, troubled by his dream, and walked to the window. The curtains were open. He could see the sunrise beginning, a huge blood orange of a morning sun surrounded by gray clouds tinged with scarlet. It was the kind of sky that makes even the most prosaic person discover a deeply buried urge to start painting in oils.Fat Charlie looked at the sunrise. Red sky in the morning, he thought. Sailor's warning.His dream had been so strange. A party in Hollywood. The secret of Walking on the Water. And that man, who was him and was not him-.Fat Charlie realized that he knew the man in his dream, knew him from somewhere, and he also realized that this would irritate him for the rest of the day if he let it, like a snag of dental floss caught between two teeth, or the precise difference between the words lubricious and lascivious, it would sit there, and it would irritate him.He stared out of the window.It was barely six in the morning, and the world was quiet. An early dog-walker, at the end of the road, was encouraging a Pomeranian to defecate. A postman ambled from house to house and back to his red van. And then something moved on the pavement beneath his house, and Fat Charlie looked down.A man was standing by the hedge. When he saw that Fat Charlie, in pajamas, was looking down at him, he grinned, and waved. A moment of recognition that shocked Fat Charlie to the core: he was familiar with both the grin and the wave, although he could not immediately see how. Something of the dream still hung about Fat Charlie's head, making him uncomfortable, making the world seem unreal. He rubbed his eyes, and now the person by the hedge was gone. Fat Charlie hoped that the man had moved on, wandered down the road into the remnants of the hanging morning mist, taking whatever awkwardnesses and irritants and madnesses he had brought away with him.And then the doorbell rang.Fat Charlie pulled on his dressing gown, and he went downstairs.He had never fastened the safety chain before opening a door, never in his life, but before he turned the handle he clicked the head of the chain into place, and he pulled the front door open six inches.""Morning?"" he said, warily.The smile that came through the crack in the door could have illuminated a small village.""You called me and I came,"" said the stranger. ""Now. You going to open this door for me, Fat Charlie?""""Who are you?"" As he said it, he knew where he had seen the man before: at his mother's funeral service, in the little chapel at the crematorium. That was the last time he had seen that smile. And he knew the answer, knew it even before the man could say the words.""I'm your brother,"" said the man.Fat Charlie closed the door. He slipped off the safety chain and opened the door all the way. The man was still there.Fat Charlie was not entirely sure how to greet a potentially imaginary brother he had not previously believed in. So they stood there, one on one side of the door, one on the other, until his brother said, ""You can call me Spider. You going to invite me in?""""Yes. I am. Of course I am. Please. Come in.""Fat Charlie led the man upstairs.Impossible things happen. When they do happen, most people just deal with it. Today, like every day, roughly five thousand people on the face of the planet will experience one-chance-in-a-million things, and not one of them will refuse to believe the evidence of their senses. Most of them will say the equivalent, in their own language, of ""Funny old world, isn't it?"" and just keep going. So while part of Fat Charlie was trying to come up with logical, sensible, sane explanations for what was going on, most of him was simply getting used to the idea that a brother he hadn't known he had was walking up the staircase behind him.They got to the kitchen and stood there.""Would you like a cup of tea?""""Got any coffee?""""Only instant, I'm afraid.""""That's fine.""Fat Charlie turned on the kettle. ""You come far, then?"" he asked.""Los Angeles.""""How was the flight?""The man sat down at the kitchen table. Now he shrugged. It was the kind of shrug that could have meant anything.""Um. You planning on staying long?""""I haven't really given it much thought."" The man - Spider - looked around Fat Charlie's kitchen as if he had never been in a kitchen before.""How do you take your coffee?""""Dark as night, sweet as sin.""Fat Charlie put the mug down in front of him, and passed him a sugar bowl. ""Help yourself.""While Spider spooned teaspoon after teaspoon of sugar into his coffee, Fat Charlie sat opposite him, and stared.There was a family resemblance between the two men. That was unarguable, although that alone did not explain the intense feeling of familiarity that Fat Charlie felt on seeing Spider. His brother looked like Fat Charlie wished he looked in his mind, unconstrained by the faintly disappointing fellow that he saw, with monotonous regularity, in the bathroom mirror. Spider was taller, and leaner, and cooler. He was wearing a black-and-scarlet leather jacket, and black leather leggings, and he looked at home in them. Fat Charlie tried to remember if this was what the fly guy had been wearing in his dream. There was something larger-than-life about him: simply being on the other side of the table to this man made Fat Charlie feel awkward and badly constructed, and slightly foolish. It wasn't the clothes Spider wore, but the knowledge that if Fat Charlie put them on he would look as if he were wearing some kind of unconvincing drag. It wasn't the way Spider smiled - casually, delightedly - but Fat Charlie's cold, incontrovertible certainty that he himself could practice smiling in front of a mirror from now until the end of time and never manage a single smile one half so charming, so cocky, or so twinklingly debonair.""You were at Mum's cremation,"" said Fat Charlie.""I thought about coming over to talk to you after the service,"" said Spider. ""I just wasn't certain that it would be a good idea.""""I wish you had."" Fat Charlie thought of something. He said, ""I would have thought you'd have been at Dad's funeral.""Spider said, ""What?""""His funeral. It was in Florida. Couple of days ago.""Spider shook his head. ""He's not dead,"" he said. ""I'm pretty sure I'd know if he were dead.""""He's dead. I buried him. Well, I filled the grave. Ask Mrs. Higgler.""Spider said, ""How'd he die?""""Heart failure.""""That doesn't mean anything. That just means he died.""""Well, yes. He did.""Spider had stopped smiling. Now he was staring down into his coffee as if he suspected he was going to be able to find an answer in there. ""I ought to check this out,"" said Spider. ""It's not that I don't believe you. But when it's your old man. Even when your old man is my old man."" And he made a face. Fat Charlie knew what that face meant. He had made it himself, from the inside, enough times, when the subject of his father came up. ""Is she still living in the same place? Next door to where we grew up?""""Mrs. Higgler? Yes. Still there.""""You don't have anything from there, do you? A picture? Maybe a photograph?""""I brought home a box of them."" Fat Charlie had not opened the large cardboard box yet. It was still sitting in the hall. He carried the box into the kitchen and put it down on the table. He took a kitchen knife and cut the packing tape that surrounded it; Spider reached into the box with his thin fingers, riffling through the photographs like playing cards, until he pulled out one of their mother and Mrs. Higgler, sitting on Mrs. Higgler's porch, twenty-five years earlier.""Is that porch still there?""Fat Charlie tried to remember. ""I think so,"" he said.Later, he was unable to remember whether the picture grew very big, or Spider grew very small. He could have sworn that neither of those things had actually happened; nevertheless, it was unarguable that Spider had walked into the photograph, and it had shimmered and rippled and swallowed him up.Fat Charlie rubbed his eyes. He was alone in the kitchen at six in the morning. There was a box filled with photographs and papers on the kitchen table, along with an empty mug, which he placed in the sink. He walked along the hall to his bedroom, lay down on his bed and slept until the alarm went off at seven fifteen.
AB_ch4	AB	Anansi Boys	4	4559	25863	CHAPTER FOURWHICH CONCLUDES WITH AN EVENING OF WINE, WOMEN AND SONGSFat Charlie woke up.Memories of dreams of a meeting with some film-star brother mingled with a dream in which President Taft had come to stay, bringing with him the entire cast of the cartoon. Tom and Jerry. He showered, and he took the tube to work.All through the workday something was nagging at the back of his head, and he didn't know what it was. He misplaced things. He forgot things. At one point, he started singing at his desk, not because he was happy, but because he forgot not to. He only realized he was doing it when Grahame Coats himself put his head around the door of Fat Charlie's closet to chide him. ""No radios, Walkmans, MP3players or similar instruments of music at the office,"" said Grahame Coats, with a ferrety glare. ""It bespeaks a lackadaisical attitude, of the kind one abhors in the workaday world.""""It wasn't the radio,"" admitted Fat Charlie, his ears burning.""No? Then what, pray tell, was it?""""It was me,"" said Fat Charlie.""You?""""Yes. I was singing. I'm sorry -""""I could have sworn it was the radio. And yet I was wrong. Good Lord. Well, with such a wealth of talents at your disposal, with such remarkable skills, perhaps you should leave us to tread the boards, entertain the multitudes, possibly do an end-of-the-pier show, rather than cluttering up a desk in an office where other people are trying to work. Eh? A place where people's careers are being managed.""""No,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I don't want to leave. I just wasn't thinking.""""Then,"" said Grahame Coats, ""you must learn to refrain from singing - save in the bath, the shower, or perchance the stands as you support your favorite football team. I myself am a Crystal Palace supporter. Or you will find yourself seeking gainful employment elsewhere.""Fat Charlie smiled, then realized that smiling wasn't what he wanted to do at all, and looked serious, but by that point Grahame Coats had left the room, so Fat Charlie swore under his breath, folded his arms on the desk and put his head on them.""Was that you singing?"" It was one of the new girls in the Artist Liaison department. Fat Charlie never managed to learn their names. They were always gone by then.""I'm afraid so.""""What were you singing? It was pretty.""Fat Charlie realized he didn't know. He said, ""I'm not sure. I wasn't listening.""She laughed at that, although quietly. ""He's right. You should be making records, not wasting your time here.""Fat Charlie didn't know what to say. Cheeks burning, he started crossing out numbers and making notes and gathering up Post-it notes with messages on them and putting those messages up on the screen, until he was sure that she had gone.Maeve Livingstone phoned: Could Fat Charlie please ensure that Grahame Coats phoned her bank manager. He said he'd do his best. She told him pointedly to see that he did.Rosie called him on his mobile at four in the afternoon, to let him know that the water was now back on again in her flat and to tell him that, good news, her mother had decided to take an interest in the upcoming wedding and had asked her to come round that evening and discuss it.""Well,"" said Fat Charlie. ""If she's organizing the dinner, we'll save a fortune on food.""""That's not nice. I'll call you tonight and let you know how it went.""Fat Charlie told her that he loved her, and he clicked the phone off. Someone was looking at him. He turned around.Grahame Coats said, ""He who maketh personal phone calls on company time, lo he shall reap the whirlwind. Do you know who said that?""""You did?""""Indeed I did,"" said Grahame Coats. ""Indeed I did. And never a truer word was spoken. Consider this a formal warning."" And he smiled then, the kind of self-satisfied smile that forced Fat Charlie to ponder the various probable outcomes of sinking his fist into Grahame Coats's comfortably padded midsection. He decided that it would be a toss-up between being fired and an action for assault. Either way, he thought, it would be a fine thing-.Fat Charlie was not by nature a violent man; still, he could dream. His daydreams tended to be small and comfortable things. He would like to have enough money to eat in good restaurants whenever he wished. He wanted a job in which nobody could tell him what to do. He wanted to be able to sing without embarrassment, somewhere there were never any people around to hear him.This afternoon, however, his daydreams assumed a different shape: he could fly, for a start, and bullets bounced off his mighty chest as he zoomed down from the sky and rescued Rosie from a band of kidnapping scoundrels and dastards. She would hold him tightly as they flew off into the sunset, off to his Fortress of Cool, where she would be so overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude that she would enthusiastically decide not to bother with the whole waiting-until-they-were-married bit, and would start to see how high and how fast they could fill their jar-.The daydream eased the stress of life in the Grahame Coats Agency, of telling people that their checks were in the post, of calling in money the agency was owed.At 6:00 PM Fat Charlie turned off his computer, and walked down the five flights of stairs to the street. It had not rained. Overhead, the starlings were wheeling and cheeping: the dusk chorus of a city. Everyone on the pavement was hurrying somewhere. Most of them, like Fat Charlie, were walking up Kingsway to Holborn tube. They had their heads down and the look about them of people who wanted to get home for the night.There was one person on the pavement who wasn't going anywhere, though. He stood there, facing Fat Charlie and the remaining commuters, and his leather jacket flapped in the wind. He was not smiling.Fat Charlie saw him from the end of the street. As he walked toward him everything became unreal. The day melted, and he realized what he had spent the day trying to remember.""Hello, Spider,"" he said, when he got close.Spider looked like a storm was raging inside him. He might have been about to cry. Fat Charlie didn't know. There was too much emotion on his face, in the way he stood, so the people on the street looked away, ashamed.""I went out there,"" he said. His voice was dull. ""I saw Mrs. Higgler. She took me to the grave. My father died, and I didn't know.""Fat Charlie said, ""He was my father too, Spider."" He wondered how he could have forgotten Spider, how he could have dismissed him so easily as a dream.""True.""The dusk sky was crosshatched with starlings; they wheeled and crossed from rooftop to rooftop.Spider jerked, and stood straight. He seemed to have come to a decision. ""You are so right,"" he said. ""We got to do this together.""""Exactly,"" said Fat Charlie. Then he said, ""Do what?"" but Spider had already hailed a cab.""We are men with troubles,"" said Spider to the world. ""Our father is no more. Our hearts are heavy in our chests. Sorrow settles upon us like pollen in hay fever season. Darkness is our lot, and misfortune our only companion.""""Right, gentlemen,"" said the cabbie, brightly. ""Where am I taking you?""""To where the three remedies for darkness of the soul may be found,"" said Spider.""Maybe we could get a curry,"" suggested Fat Charlie.""There are three things, and three things only, that can lift the pain of mortality and ease the ravages of life,"" said Spider. ""These things are wine, women and song.""""Curry's nice too,"" pointed out Fat Charlie, but nobody was listening to him.""In any particular order?"" asked the cabbie.""Wine first,"" Spider announced. ""Rivers and lakes and vast oceans of wine.""""Right you are,"" said the cabbie, and he pulled out into the traffic.""I have a particularly bad feeling about all this,"" said Fat Charlie, helpfully.Spider nodded. ""A bad feeling,"" he said. ""Yes. We both have a bad feeling. Tonight we shall take our bad feelings and share them, and face them. We shall mourn. We shall drain the bitter dregs of mortality. Pain shared, my brother, is pain not doubled, but halved. No man is an island.""""Seek not to ask for whom the bell tolls,"" intoned the cabbie. ""It tolls for thee.""""Whoa,"" said Spider. ""Now that's a pretty heavy koan you got there.""""Thank you,"" said the cabbie.""That's how it ends, all right. You are some kind of philosopher. I'm Spider. This is my brother, Fat Charlie.""""Charles,"" said Fat Charlie.""Steve,"" said the cabbie. ""Steve Burridge.""""Mister Burridge,"" said Spider, ""how would you like to be our personal driver this evening?""Steve Burridge explained that he was coming up to the end of his shift and would now be driving his cab home for the night, that dinner with Mrs. Burridge and all the little Burridges awaited him.""You hear that?"" said Spider. ""A family man. Now, my brother and I are all the family that we have left. And this is the first time we've met.""""Sounds like quite a story,"" said the cabbie. ""Was there a feud?""""Not at all. He simply did not know that he had a brother,"" said Spider.""Did you?"" asked Fat Charlie. ""Know about me?""""I may have done,"" said Spider. ""But things like that can slip a guy's mind so easily.""The cab pulled over to the curb. ""Where are we?"" asked Fat Charlie. They hadn't gone very far. He thought they were somewhere just off Fleet Street.""What he asked for,"" said the cabbie. ""Wine.""Spider got out of the cab and stared at the grubby oak and grimy glass exterior of the ancient wine bar. ""Perfect,"" he said. ""Pay the man, Brother.""Fat Charlie paid the cabbie. They went inside: down wooden steps to a cellar where rubicund barristers drank side by side with pallid money market fund managers. There was sawdust on the floor, and a wine list chalked illegibly on a blackboard behind the bar.""What are you drinking?"" asked Spider.""Just a glass of house red, please,"" said Fat Charlie.Spider looked at him gravely. ""We are the final scions of Anansi's line. We do not mourn our father's passing with house red.""""Er. Right. Well, I'll have what you're having then.""Spider went up to the bar, easing his way through the crush of people as if it was not there. In several minutes he returned, carrying two wineglasses, a corkscrew, and an extremely dusty wine bottle. He opened the bottle with an ease that left Fat Charlie, who always wound up picking fragments of cork from his wine, deeply impressed. Spider poured from the bottle a wine so tawny it was almost black. He filled each glass, then put one in front of Fat Charlie.""A toast,"" he said. ""To our father's memory.""""To Dad,"" said Fat Charlie, and he clinked his glass against Spider's - managing, miraculously, not to spill any as he did so - and he tasted his wine. It was peculiarly bitter and herby, and salt. ""What is this?""""Funeral wine, the kind you drink for gods. They haven't made it for a long time. It's seasoned with bitter aloes and rosemary, and with the tears of brokenhearted virgins.""""And they sell it in a Fleet Street wine bar?"" Fat Charlie picked up the bottle, but the label was too faded and dusty to read. ""Never heard of it.""""These old places have the good stuff, if you ask for it,"" said Spider. ""Or maybe I just think they do.""Fat Charlie took another sip of his wine. It was powerful and pungent.""It's not a sipping wine,"" said Spider. ""It's a mourning wine. You drain it. Like this."" He took a huge swig. Then he made a face. ""It tastes better that way, too.""Fat Charlie hesitated, then took a large mouthful of the strange wine. He could imagine that he was able to taste the aloes and the rosemary. He wondered if the salt was really tears.""They put in the rosemary for remembrance,"" said Spider, and he began to top up their glasses. Fat Charlie started to try and explain that he wasn't really up for too much wine tonight and that he had to work tomorrow, but Spider cut him off. ""It's your turn to make a toast,"" he said.""Er. Right,"" said Fat Charlie. ""To Mum.""They drank to their mother. Fat Charlie found that the taste of the bitter wine was beginning to grow on him; he found his eyes prickling, and a sense of loss, profound and painful, ran through him. He missed his mother. He missed his childhood. He even missed his father. Across the table, Spider was shaking his head; a tear ran down Spider's face and plopped into the wineglass; he reached for the bottle and poured more wine for them both.Fat Charlie drank.Grief ran through him as he drank, filling his head and his body with loss and with the pain of absence, swelling through him like waves on the ocean.His own tears were running down his face, splashing into his drink. He fumbled in his pockets for a tissue. Spider poured out the last of the black wine, for both of them.""Did they really sell this wine here?""""They had a bottle they didn't know they had. They just needed to be reminded.""Fat Charlie blew his nose. ""I never knew I had a brother,"" he said.""I did,"" said Spider. ""I always meant to look you up, but I got distracted. You know how it is.""""Not really.""""Things came up.""""What kind of things?""""Things. They came up. That's what things do. They come up. I can't be expected to keep track of them all.""""Well, give me a f'rinstance.""Spider drank more wine. ""Okay. The last time I decided that you and I should meet, I, well, I spent days planning it. Wanted it to go perfectly. I had to choose my wardrobe. Then I had to decide what I'd say to you when we met. I knew that the meeting of two brothers, well, it's the subject of epics, isn't it? I decided that the only way to treat it with the appropriate gravity would be to do it in verse. But what kind of verse? Am I going to rap it? Declaim it? I mean, I'm not going to greet you with a limerick. So. It had to be something dark, something powerful, rhythmic, epic. And then I had it. The perfect first line: Blood calls to blood like sirens in the night. It says so much. I knew I'd be able to get everything in there - people dying in alleys, sweat and nightmares, the power of free spirits uncrushable. Everything was going to be there. And then I had to come up with a second line, and the whole thing completely fell apart. The best I could come up with was Tum- tumpty- tumpty- tumpty got a fright.""Fat Charlie blinked. ""Who exactly is Tum- tumpty- tumpty- tumpty?""""It's not anybody. It's just there to show you where the words ought to be. But I never really got any further on it than that, and I couldn't turn up with just a first line, some tumpties and three words of an epic poem, could I? That would have been disrespecting you.""""Well-.""""Exactly. So I went to Hawaii for the week instead. Like I said, something came up.""Fat Charlie drank more of his wine. He was beginning to like it. Sometimes strong tastes fit strong emotions, and this was one of those times. ""It couldn't always have been the second line of a poem, though,"" he said.Spider put his thin hand on top of Fat Charlie's larger hand. ""Enough about me,"" he said. ""I want to hear about you.""""Not much to tell,"" said Fat Charlie. He told his brother about his life. About Rosie and Rosie's mother, about Grahame Coats and the Grahame Coats Agency, and his brother nodded his head. It didn't sound like much of a life, now that Fat Charlie was putting it into words.""Still,"" Fat Charlie said, philosophically, ""I figure that there are those people you read about in the gossip pages of newspapers. And they are always saying how dull and empty and pointless their lives are."" He held the wine bottle above his glass, hoping there was just enough of the wine left for another mouthful, but there was barely a drip. The bottle was empty. It had lasted longer than it had any right to have lasted, but now there was nothing left at all.Spider stood up. ""I've met those people,"" he said. ""The ones from the glossy magazines. I've walked among them. I have seen, firsthand, their callow, empty lives. I have watched them from the shadows when they thought themselves alone. And I can tell you this: I'm afraid there is not one of them who would swap lives with you at gunpoint, my brother. Come on.""""Whuh? Where are you going?""""We are going. We have accomplished the first part of tonight's triune mission. Wine has been drunk. Two parts left to go.""""Er-.""Fat Charlie followed Spider outside, hoping the cool night air would clear his head. It didn't. Fat Charlie's head was feeling like it might float away if it wasn't firmly tied down.""Women next,"" said Spider. ""Then song.""It is possibly worth mentioning that in Fat Charlie's world, women did not simply turn up. You needed to be introduced to them; you needed to pluck up the courage to talk to them; you needed to find a subject to talk about when you did, and then, once you had achieved those heights, there were further peaks to scale. You needed to dare to ask them if they were doing anything on Saturday night, and then when you did, mostly they had hair that needed washing that night, or diaries to update, or cockatiels to groom, or they simply needed to wait by the phone for some other man not to call.But Spider lived in a different world.They wandered toward the West End, stopping when they reached a crowded pub. The patrons spilled out onto the pavement, and Spider stopped and said hello to what turned out to be a birthday celebration for a young lady named Sybilla, who was only too flattered when Spider insisted on buying a birthday round of drinks for her and for her friends. Then he told jokes (""- and the duck says, put it on my bill? Whaddayathink I am? Some kinda pervert?"") and he laughed at his own jokes, a booming, joyful laugh. He could remember the names of all the people around him. He talked to people and listened to what they said. When Spider announced it was time to find another pub, the entire birthday group decided, as one woman, that they were coming with him-.By the time they reached their third pub, Spider resembled someone from a rock video. He was draped with girls. They snuggled in. Several of them had kissed him, half-jokingly, half-seriously. Fat Charlie watched in envious horror.""You his bodyguard?"" asked one of the girls.""What?""""His bodyguard. Are you?""""No,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I'm his brother.""""Wow,"" she said. ""I didn't know he had a brother. I think he's amazing.""""Me, too,"" said another, who had spent some time cuddling Spider until forced away by the press of other bodies with similar ideas. She noticed Fat Charlie for the first time. ""Are you his manager?""""No. He's the brother,"" said the first girl. ""He was just telling me,"" she added, pointedly.The second ignored her. ""Are you from the States as well?"" she asked. ""You've sort of got a bit of an accent.""""When I was younger,"" said Fat Charlie. ""We lived in Florida. My dad was American, my mum was from, well she was originally from Saint Andrews, but she grew up in-.""Nobody was listening.When they moved on from there, the remnants of the birthday celebration accompanied them. The women surrounded Spider, inquiring where they were going next. Restaurants were suggested, as were nightclubs. Spider simply grinned and kept walking.Fat Charlie trailed along behind them, feeling more left-out than ever.They stumbled through the neon-and-striplight world. Spider had his arms around several of the women. He would kiss them as he walked, indiscriminately, like a man taking a bite from first one summer fruit, then another. None of them seemed to mind.It's not normal, thought Fat Charlie. That's what it's not. He was not even trying to keep up, merely attempting not to be left behind.He could still taste the bitter wine on his tongue.He became aware that a girl was walking along beside him. She was small, and pretty in a pixieish sort of way. She tugged at his sleeve. ""What are we doing?"" she asked. ""Where are we going?""""We're mourning my father,"" he said, ""I think.""""Is it a reality TV show?""""I hope not.""Spider stopped and turned. The gleam in his eyes was disturbing. ""We are here,"" he announced. ""We have arrived. It is what he would have wanted."" There was a handwritten message on a sheet of bright orange paper on the door outside the pub. It said on it, Tonight. Upstair's. KAROAKE.""Song,"" said Spider. Then he said, ""It's showtime!""""No,"" said Fat Charlie. He stopped where he was.""It's what he loved,"" said Spider.""I don't sing. Not in public. And I'm drunk. And, I really don't think this is a really good idea.""""It's a great idea."" Spider had a perfectly convincing smile. Properly deployed, a smile like that could launch a holy war. Fat Charlie, however, was not convinced.""Look,"" he said, trying to keep the panic from his voice. ""There are things that people don't do. Right? Some people don't fly. Some people don't have sex in public. Some people don't turn into smoke and blow away. I don't do any of those things, and I don't sing either.""""Not even for Dad?""""Especially not for Dad. He's not going to embarrass me from beyond the grave. Well, not any more than he has already."""" 'Scuse me,"" said one of the young women. "" 'Scuse me but are we going in? 'Cause I'm getting cold out here, and Sybilla needs to wee.""""We're going in,"" said Spider, and he smiled at her.Fat Charlie wanted to protest, to stand his ground, but he found himself swept inside, hating himself.He caught up with Spider on the stairs. ""I'll go in,"" he said. ""But I won't sing.""""You're already in.""""I know. But I'm not singing.""""Not much point in saying you won't go in if you're already in.""""I can't sing.""""You telling me I inherited all the musical talent as well?""""I'm telling you that if I have to open my mouth in order to sing in public, I'll throw up.""Spider squeezed his arm, reassuringly. ""You watch how I do it,"" he said.The birthday girl and two of her friends stumbled up onto the little dais, and giggled their way through ""Dancing Queen."" Fat Charlie drank a gin and tonic somebody had put into his hand, and he winced at every note they missed, at every key change that didn't happen. There was a round of applause from the rest of the birthday group.Another of the women took the stage. It was the pixieish one who had asked Fat Charlie where they were going. The opening chords sounded to ""Stand by Me,"" and she began, using the phrase in its most approximate and all-encompassing way, to sing along: she missed every note, came in too soon or too late on every line, and misread most of them. Fat Charlie felt for her.She climbed down from the stage and came toward the bar. Fat Charlie was going to say something sympathetic, but she was glowing with joy. ""That was so great,"" she said. ""I mean, that was just a mazing."" Fat Charlie bought her a drink, a large vodka and orange. ""That was such a laugh,"" she told him. ""Are you going to do it? Go on. You have to do it. I bet you won't be any crapper than I was.""Fat Charlie shrugged, in a way that, he hoped, indicated that he contained within him depths of crap as yet unplumbed.Spider walked over to the little stage as if a spotlight was following him.""I bet this will be good,"" said the vodka and orange. ""Did someone say you were his brother?""""No,"" muttered Fat Charlie, ungraciously. ""I said that he was my brother.""Spider began to sing. It was ""Under the Boardwalk.""It wouldn't have happened if Fat Charlie had not liked the song so much. When Fat Charlie was thirteen he had believed that ""Under the Boardwalk"" was the greatest song in the world (by the time he was a jaded and world-weary fourteen-year-old, it had become Bob Marley's ""No Woman No Cry""). And now Spider was singing his song, and singing it well. He sang it in tune, he sang it as if he meant it. People stopped drinking, stopped talking, and they looked at him, and they listened.When Spider finished singing, people cheered. Had they been wearing hats, they might well have flung them into the air.""I can see why you wouldn't want to follow that,"" said the vodka and orange to Fat Charlie. ""I mean, you can't follow that, can you?""""Well-."" said Fat Charlie.""I mean,"" she said with a grin, ""you can see who's got all the talent in your family."" She tipped her head, as she said it, and tilted her chin. It was the chin-tilt that did it.Fat Charlie headed toward the stage, putting one foot in front of the other in an impressive display of physical dexterity. He was sweating.The next few minutes passed in a blur. He spoke to the DJ, chose his song from the list - ""Unforgettable"" - waited for what seemed like a brief eternity, and was handed a microphone.His mouth was dry. His heart was fluttering in his chest.On the screen was his first word: Unforgettable-.Now, Fat Charlie could really sing. He had range and power and expression. When he sang his whole body became an instrument.The music started.In Fat Charlie's head, he was all ready to open his mouth, and to sing. ""Unforgettable,"" he would sing. He would sing it to his dead father and to his brother and the night, telling them all that they were things it was impossible to forget.Only he couldn't do it. There were people looking up at him. Barely two dozen of them, in the upstairs room of a pub. Many of them were women. In front of an audience, Fat Charlie couldn't even open his mouth.He could hear the music playing, but he just stood there. He felt very cold. His feet seemed a long way away.He forced his mouth open.""I think,"" he said, very distinctly, into the microphone, over the music, and heard his words echoing back from every corner of the room. ""I think I'm going to be sick.""There was no graceful exit from the stage.After that, everything got a bit wobbly.There are myth-places. They exist, each in their own way. Some of them are overlaid on the world; others exist beneath the world as it is, like an underpainting.There are mountains. They are the rocky places you will reach before you come to the cliffs that border the end of the world, and there are caves in those mountains, deep caves that were inhabited long before the first men walked the earth.They are inhabited still.
AB_ch4	AB	Anansi Boys	4	8811	49631	CHAPTER FOURTEENWHICH COMES TO SEVERAL CONCLUSIONSCharlie woke to a banging on a door. Disoriented, he looked around: he was in a hotel room; various unlikely events clustered inside his head like moths around a naked bulb, and while he tried to make sense of them he let his feet get up and walk him to the hotel room door. He blinked at the diagram on the back of the door which told him where to go in case of fire, trying to remember the events of the previous night. Then he unlocked the door and pulled it open.Daisy looked up at him. She said, ""Were you asleep in that hat?""Charlie put his hand up and felt his head. There was definitely a hat on it. ""Yes,"" he said. ""I think I must have been.""""Bless,"" she said. ""Well, at least you took your shoes off. You know you missed all the excitement, last night?""""I did?""""Brush your teeth,"" she said helpfully. ""And change your shirt. Yes, you did. While you were-"" and then she hesitated. It seemed quite improbable, on reflection, that he really had vanished in the middle of a séance. These things did not happen. Not in the real world. ""While you weren't there. I got the police chief to go up to Grahame Coats's house. He had those tourists.""""Tourists-?""""It was what he said at dinner, something about us sending the two people in, the two at the house. It was your fiancée and her mother. He'd locked them up in his basement.""""Are they okay?""""They're both in the hospital.""""Oh.""""Her mum's in rough shape. I think your fiancée will be okay.""""Will you stop calling her that? She's not my fiancée. She ended the engagement.""""Yes. But you didn't, did you?""""She's not in love with me,"" said Charlie. ""Now, I'm going to brush my teeth and change my shirt, and I need a certain amount of privacy.""""You should shower too,"" she said. ""And that hat smells like a cigar.""""It's a family heirloom,"" he told her, and he went into the bathroom and locked the door behind him.The hospital was a ten-minute-walk from the hotel, and Spider was sitting in the waiting room, holding a dog-eared copy of Entertainment Weekly magazine as if he were actually reading it.Charlie tapped him on the shoulder, and Spider jumped. He looked up warily and then, seeing his brother, he relaxed, but not much. ""They said I had to wait out here,"" Spider said. ""Because I'm not a relation or anything.""Charlie boggled. ""Well, why didn't you just tell them you were a relative? Or a doctor?""Spider looked uncomfortable. ""Well, it's easy to do that stuff if you don't care. If it doesn't matter if I go in or I don't, it's easy to go in. But now it matters, and I'd hate to get in the way or do something wrong, and I mean, what if I tried and they said no, and then- what are you grinning about?""""Nothing really,"" said Charlie. ""It just all sounds a bit familiar. Come on. Let's go and find Rosie. You know,"" he said to Daisy, as they set off down a random corridor, ""there are two ways to walk through a hospital. Either you look like you belong there - here you go Spider. White coat on back of door, just your size. Put it on - or you should look so out of place that no one will complain that you're there. They'll just leave it for someone else to sort out."" He began to hum.""What's that song?"" asked Daisy.""It's called 'Yellow Bird,' "" said Spider.Charlie pushed his hat back on his head, and they walked into Rosie's hospital room.Rosie was sitting up in bed, reading a magazine, and looking worried. When she saw the three of them come in, she looked more worried. She looked from Spider to Charlie and back again.""You're both a long way from home,"" was all she said.""We all are,"" said Charlie. ""Now, you've met Spider. This is Daisy. She's in the police.""""I'm not sure that I am anymore,"" said Daisy. ""I'm probably in all kinds of hot water.""""You're the one who was there last night? The one who got the island police to come up to the house?"" Rosie stopped. She said, ""Any word on Grahame Coats?""""He's in intensive care, just like your mum.""""Well, if she comes to before he does,"" said Rosie, ""I expect she'll kill him."" Then she said, ""They won't talk to me about my mum's condition. They just say that it's very serious, and they'll tell me as soon as there's anything to tell."" She looked at Charlie with clear eyes. ""She's not as bad as you think she is, really. Not when you get time to know her. We had a lot of time to talk, locked up in the dark. She's all right.""She blew her nose. Then she said, ""They don't think she's going to make it. They haven't directly said that to me, but they sort of said it in a not-saying-it sort of way. It's funny. I thought she'd live through anything.""Charlie said, ""Me too. I figured even if there was a nuclear war, it would still leave radioactive cockroaches and your mum.""Daisy stepped on his foot. She said, ""Do they know anything more about what hurt her?""""I told them,"" said Rosie. ""There was some kind of animal in the house. Maybe it was just Grahame Coats. I mean it sort of was him, but it was sort of someone else. She distracted it from me, and it went for her-"" She had explained it all as best she could to the island police that morning. She had decided not to talk about the blonde ghost-woman. Sometimes minds snap under pressure, and she thought it best if people did not know that hers had.Rosie broke off. She was staring at Spider as if she had only just remembered who he was. She said, ""I still hate you, you know."" Spider said nothing, but a miserable expression crept across his face, and he no longer looked like a doctor: now he looked like a man who had borrowed a white coat from behind a door and was worried that someone would notice. A dreamlike tone came into her voice. ""Only,"" she said, ""only when I was in the dark, I thought that you were helping me. That you were keeping the animal away. What happened to your face? It's all scratched.""""It was an animal,"" said Spider.""You know,"" she said, ""Now I see you both at once, you don't look anything alike at all.""""I'm the good-looking one,"" said Charlie, and Daisy's foot pressed down on his toes for the second time.""Bless,"" said Daisy, quietly. And then, slightly louder, ""Charlie? There's something we need to talk about outside. Now.""They went out into the hospital corridor, leaving Spider inside.""What?"" said Charlie.""What what?"" said Daisy.""What have we got to talk about?""""Nothing.""""Then why are we out here? You heard her. She hates him. We shouldn't have left them alone together. She's probably killed him by now.""Daisy looked up at him with the kind of expression that Jesus might have given someone who had just explained that he was probably allergic to bread and fishes, so could He possibly do him a quick chicken salad: there was pity in that expression, along with almost infinite compassion.She touched a finger to her lips and pulled him back toward the door. He looked back into the hospital room: Rosie did not appear to be killing Spider. Quite the opposite, if anything. ""Oh,"" said Charlie.They were kissing. Put like that, and you could be forgiven for presuming that this was a normal kiss, all lips and skin and possibly even a little tongue. You'd miss how he smiled, how his eyes glowed. And then, after the kiss was done, how he stood, like a man who had just discovered the art of standing and had figured out how to do it better than anyone else who would ever come along.Charlie turned his attention back to the corridor to find Daisy in conversation with several doctors and the police officer they had encountered the previous evening.""Well, we always had him figured as a bad man,"" the police officer was saying to Daisy. ""I mean, frankly, you only get this kind of behavior from foreigners. The local people, they simply wouldn't do that kind of thing.""""Obviously not,"" said Daisy.""Very. Very grateful,"" said the police chief, patting her shoulder in a way that set Daisy's teeth on edge. ""This little lady saved that woman's life,"" he told Charlie, giving his shoulder a patronizing pat for good measure, before setting off with the doctors down the corridor.""So what's happening?"" asked Charlie.""Well, Grahame Coats is dead,"" she said. ""More or less. And they don't hold out any hope for Rosie's mum, either.""""I see,"" said Charlie. He thought about this. Then he finished thinking and came to a decision. Said, ""Would you mind if I just chatted to my brother for a bit? I think he and I need to talk.""""I'm going back to the hotel anyway. I'm going to check my e-mail. Probably going to have to say sorry on the phone a lot. Find out if I still have a career.""""But you're a hero, aren't you?""""I don't think that's what anyone was paying me for,"" she said, a little wanly. ""Come and find me at the hotel when you're done.""Spider and Charlie walked down the Williamstown high street in the morning sun.""You know, that really is a good hat,"" said Spider.""You really think so?""""Yeah. Can I try it on?""Charlie gave Spider the green fedora. Spider put it on, looked at his reflection in a shop window. He made a face and gave Charlie the hat back. ""Well,"" he said, disappointed, ""it looks good on you, anyway.""Charlie pushed his fedora back onto his head. Some hats can only be worn if you're willing to be jaunty, to set them at an angle and to walk beneath them with a spring in your stride as if you're only a step away from dancing. They demand a lot of you. This hat was one of those, and Charlie was up to it. He said, ""Rosie's mum is dying.""""Yeah.""""I really, really never liked her.""""I didn't know her as well as you did. But given time, I'm sure I would have really, really disliked her too.""Charlie said, ""We have to try and save her life, don't we?"" He said it without enthusiasm, like someone pointing out it was time to visit the dentist.""I don't think we can do things like that.""""Dad did something like it for mum. He got her better, for a while.""""But that was him. I don't know how we'd do that.""Charlie said, ""The place at the end of the world. With the caves.""""Beginning of the world, not the end. What about it?""""Can we just get there? Without all that candles-and-herbs malarkey?""Spider was quiet. Then he nodded, ""I think so.""They turned together, turned in a direction that wasn't usually there, and they walked away from the Williamstown high street.Now the sun was rising, and Charlie and Spider walked across a beach littered with skulls. They were not proper human skulls, and they covered the beach like yellow pebbles. Charlie avoided them where he could, while Spider crunched his way through them. At the end of the beach they took a left turn that was left to absolutely everything, and the mountains at the beginning of the world towered above them and the cliffs fell away below.Charlie remembered the last time he was here, and it seemed like a thousand years ago. ""Where is everyone?"" he said aloud, and his voice echoed against the rocks and came back to him. He said, loudly, ""Hello?""And then they were there, watching him. All of them. They seemed grander, now, less human, more animal, wilder. He realized that he had seen them as people last time because he had expected to meet people. But they were not people. Arrayed on the rocks above them were Lion and Elephant, Crocodile and Python, Rabbit and Scorpion, and the rest of them, hundreds of them, and they stared at him with eyes unsmiling: animals he recognized; animals that no one living would be able to identify. All the animals that have ever been in stories. All the animals that people have dreamed of, worshipped, or placated.Charlie saw all of them.It's one thing, he thought, singing for your life, in a room filled with diners, on the spur of the moment, with a gun barrel in the ribs of the girl you-That you-Oh.Well, thought Charlie, I can worry about that later.Right now he badly wanted either to breathe into a brown paper bag or to vanish.""There must be hundreds of them,"" said Spider, and there was awe in his voice.There was a flurry in the air, on a nearby rock, which resolved itself into the Bird Woman. She folded her arms and stared at them.""Whatever it is you're going to do,"" Spider said, ""you better do it soon. They aren't going to wait around forever.""Charlie's mouth was dry. ""Right.""Spider said, ""So. Um. What exactly do we do now?""""We sing to them,"" said Charlie, simply.""What?""""It's how we fix things. I figured it out. We just sing it all, you and I.""""I don't understand. Sing what?""Charlie said, ""The song. You sing the song, you fix things."" Now he sounded desperate. ""The song.""Spider's eyes were like puddles after the rain, and Charlie saw things in them he had not seen before: affection, perhaps, and confusion and, mostly, apology. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""Lion watched them from the side of a boulder. Monkey looked at them from the top of a tree. And Tiger-Charlie saw Tiger. It was walking gingerly on four feet. Its face was swollen and bruised, but there was a glint in its eyes, and it looked as if it would be more than happy to even the score.Charlie opened his mouth. A small croaking noise came out, as if Charlie had recently swallowed a particularly nervous frog. ""It's no use,"" he whispered to Spider. ""This was a stupid idea, wasn't it?""""Yup.""""Do you think we can just go away again?"" Charlie's nervous glance swept the mountainside and the caves, took in each of the hundreds of totem creatures from before the dawn of time. There was one he had not seen the last time he had looked: a small man, with lemon yellow gloves and a pencil-thin moustache and no fedora hat to cover his thinning hair.The old man winked when he caught Charlie's gaze.It wasn't much, but it was enough.Charlie filled his lungs, and he began to sing. ""I am Charlie,"" he sang. ""I am Anansi's son. Listen as I sing my song. Listen to my life.""He sang them the song of a boy who was half a god, and who was broken into two by an old woman with a grudge. He sang of his father, and he sang of his mother.He sang of names and words, of the building blocks beneath the real, the worlds that make worlds, the truths beneath the way things are; he sang of appropriate ends and just conclusions for those who would have hurt him and his.He sang the world.It was a good song, and it was his song. Sometimes it had words, and sometimes it didn't have any words at all.As he sang, all the creatures listening began to clap and to stamp and to hum along; Charlie felt like he was the conduit for a great song that took in all of them. He sang of birds, of the magic of looking up and seeing them in flight, of the sheen of the sun on a wing feather in the morning.The totem creatures were dancing now, the dances of their kind. The Bird Woman danced the wheeling dance of birds, fanning her tail feathers, tossing back her beak.There was only one creature on the mountainside who did not dance.Tiger lashed his tail. He was not clapping or singing or dancing. His face was bruised purple, and his body was covered in welts and in bite marks. He had padded down the rocks, a step at a time, until he was close to Charlie. ""The songs aren't yours,"" he growled.Charlie looked at him, and sang about Tiger, and about Grahame Coats, and those who would prey upon the innocent. He turned: Spider was looking up at him with admiration. Tiger roared in anger, and Charlie took the roar and wound his song around it. Then he did the roar himself, just like Tiger had done it. Well, the roar began just as Tiger's roar had, but then Charlie changed it, so it became a really goofy sort of roar, and all the creatures watching from the rocks started to laugh. They couldn't help it. Charlie did the goofy roar again. Like any impersonation, like any perfect caricature, it had the effect of making what it made fun of intrinsically ridiculous. No one would ever hear Tiger roar again without hearing Charlie's roar underneath it. ""Goofy sort of a roar,"" they'd say.Tiger turned his back on Charlie. He loped through the crowd, roaring as he ran, which only made the crowd laugh the harder. Tiger angrily retreated back into his cave.Spider gestured with his hands, a curt movement.There was a rumble, and the mouth of Tiger's cave collapsed in a small rock slide. Spider looked satisfied. Charlie kept singing.He sang the song of Rosie Noah and the song of Rosie's mother: he sang a long life for Mrs. Noah and all the happiness that she deserved.He sang of his life, all of their lives, and in his song he saw the pattern of their lives as a web that a fly had blundered into, and with his song he wrapped the fly, made certain it would not escape, and he repaired the web with new strands.And now the song was coming to its natural end.Charlie realized, with no little surprise, that he enjoyed singing to other people, and he knew, at that moment, that this was what he would spend the rest of his life doing. He would sing: not big, magical songs that made worlds or recreated existence. Just small songs that would make people happy for a breath, make them move, make them for a little while, forget their problems. And he knew that there would always be the fear before performing, the stage fright, that would never go away, but he also understood that it would be like jumping into a swimming pool - only uncomfortably chill for a few seconds - and then the discomfort would pass and it would be good-.Never this good. Never this good again. But good enough.And then he was done. Charlie hung his head. The creatures on the cliff top let the last notes die away, stopped stamping, stopped clapping, stopped dancing. Charlie took off his father's green fedora and fanned his face with it.Under his breath, Spider said, ""That was amazing.""""You could have done it too,"" said Charlie.""I don't think so. What was happening at the end? I felt you doing something, but I couldn't really tell what it was.""""I fixed things,"" said Charlie. ""For us. I think. I'm not really sure-."" And he wasn't. Now the song was over, the content of the song was unraveling like a dream in the morning.He pointed to the cave mouth that was blocked by rocks. ""Did you do that?""""Yeah,"" said Spider. ""Seemed the least I could do. Tiger will dig his way out eventually, though. I wish I'd done something worse than just shut the door on him, to be honest.""""Not to worry,"" said Charlie. ""I did. Something much worse.""He watched the animals disperse. His father was nowhere to be seen, which did not surprise him. ""Come on,"" he said. ""We ought to be getting back.""Spider went back to see Rosie at visiting time. He was carrying a large box of chocolates, the largest that the hospital gift shop sold.""For you,"" he said.""Thanks.""""They told me,"" she said, ""that they think my mum's going to pull through. Apparently she opened her eyes and asked for porridge. The doctor said it's a miracle.""""Yup. Your mother asking for food. Certainly sounds like a miracle to me.""She swatted his arm with her hand, then left her hand resting on his arm.""You know,"" she said, after a while, ""You're going to think this is silly of me. But when I was in the dark, with Mum, I thought that you were helping me. I felt like you were keeping the beast at bay. That if you hadn't've done what you were doing, he would have killed us.""""Um. I probably helped.""""Really?""""I don't know. I think so. I was in trouble as well, and I thought about you.""""Were you in very big trouble?""""Enormous. Yes.""""Will you pour me a glass of water, please?""He did. She said, ""Spider, what do you do?""""Do?""""For a job.""""Whatever I feel like doing.""""I think,"" she said, ""I may stay here, for a bit. The nurses have been telling me how much they need teachers here. I'd like to see that I was making a difference.""""That might be fun.""""And what would you do, if I did?""""Oh. Well, if you were here, I'm sure I could find something to keep me busy.""Their fingers twined, tight as a ship's knot.""Do you think we can make this work?"" she asked.""I think so,"" said Spider, soberly. ""And if I get bored with you, I'll just go away and do something else. So not to worry.""""Oh,"" said Rosie, ""I'm not worried."" And she wasn't. There was steel in her voice beneath the softness. You could tell where her mother got it from.Charlie found Daisy on a deck chair out on the beach. He thought she was asleep in the sun. When his shadow touched her, she said, ""Hello Charlie."" She didn't open her eyes.""How did you know it was me?""""Your hat smells like a cigar. Are you going to be getting rid of it soon?""""No,"" said Charlie. ""I told you. Family heirloom. I plan to wear it till I die, then leave it to my children. So. Do you still have a job with the police force?""""Sort of,"" she said. ""My boss said that it's been decided that what I was suffering from was nervous exhaustion brought on by overwork, and I'm on sick leave until I feel well enough to come back.""""Ah. And when will that be?""""Not sure,"" she said. ""Can you pass the suntan oil?""He had a box in his pocket. He took it out and put it on the arm of the deck chair. ""In a minute. Er."" He paused. ""You know,"" he said, ""we've already done the big embarrassing one of these at gunpoint."" He opened the box. ""But this is for you, from me. Well, Rosie returned it to me. And we can swap it for one you like. Pick out a different one. Probably it won't even fit. But it's yours. If you want it. And um. Me.""She reached into the box and took out the engagement ring.""Hmph. All right,"" she said. ""As long as you're not just doing it to get the lime back.""Tiger prowled. His tail lashed irritably from side to side as he paced back and forth across the mouth of his cave. His eyes burned like emerald torches in the shadows.""Whole world and everything used to be mine,"" said Tiger. ""Moon and stars and sun and stories. I owned them all.""""I feel it incumbent on me to point out,"" said a small voice from the back of the cave, ""that you said that already.""Tiger paused in his pacing; he turned then and insinuated himself into the back of his cave, rippling as he walked, like a fur rug over hydraulic springs. He padded back until he came to the carcass of an ox, and he said, in a quiet voice, ""I beg your pardon.""There was a scrabbling from inside the carcass. The tip of a nose protruded from the rib cage. ""Actually,"" it said, ""I was, so to speak, agreeing with you. That was what I was doing.""Little white hands pulled a thin strip of dried meat from between two ribs, revealing a small animal the color of dirty snow. It might have been an albino mongoose, or perhaps some particularly shifty kind of weasel in its winter coat. It had a scavenger's eyes.""Whole world and everything used to be mine. Moon and stars and sun and stories. I owned them all."" Then he said, ""Would have been mine again.""Tiger stared down at the little beast. Then, without warning, one huge paw descended, smashing the rib cage, breaking the carcass into foul-smelling fragments, pinning the little animal to the floor; it wriggled and writhed, but it could not escape.""You are here,"" said Tiger, his huge head nose to nose with the pale animal's tiny head, ""you are here under my sufferance. Do you understand that? Because the next time you say something irritating, I shall bite your head off.""""Mmmph,"" said the weasely thing.""You wouldn't like it if I bit off your head, would you?""""Nngk,"" said the smaller animal. Its eyes were a pale blue, two chips of ice, and they glinted as it twisted uncomfortably beneath the weight of the huge paw.""So will you promise me that you will behave, and you will be quiet?"" rumbled Tiger. He lifted his paw a little to allow the beast to speak.""Indeedy,"" said the small white thing, extremely politely. Then, with one weasely movement, it twisted and sank its sharp little teeth into Tiger's paw. Tiger bellowed in pain, whipped the paw back, sending the little animal flying through the air. It struck the rock ceiling, bounced over to a ledge, and from there it darted, like a dirty white streak, to the very back of the cave, where the ceiling got low and close to the floor, and where there were many hiding places for a small animal, places a larger animal could not go.Tiger padded as far back into the cave as it could easily walk. ""You think I can't wait?"" he asked. ""You have to come out sooner or later. I'm not going anywhere."" Tiger lay down. He closed his eyes and soon began to make fairly convincing snoring noises.After about half an hour of snoring from Tiger, the pale animal crept out from the rocks and slipped from shadow to shadow, making for a large bone that still had plenty of good meat on it, if you didn't mind a certain rankness, and it didn't. Still, to get to the bone, it would have to pass the great beast. It lurked in the shadows, then it ventured out on little silent feet.As it passed the sleeping Tiger, a forepaw shot out, and a claw slammed down on the creature's tail, pinning it down. Another paw held the little creature behind the neck. The great cat opened its eyes. ""Frankly,"" it said, ""we appear to be stuck with each other. So all I'm asking is that you make an effort. We can both make an effort. I rather doubt that we'll ever be friends, but perhaps we could learn to tolerate each other.""""I take your point,"" said the small ferretty thing. ""Needs must, as they say, when the Devil drives.""""That's an example of what I'm saying,"" said Tiger. ""You just have to learn when to keep your mouth shut.""""It's an ill wind,"" said the little animal, ""that blows nobody any good.""""Now you're irritating me again,"" said Tiger. ""I'm trying to tell you. Don't irritate me, and I won't bite off your head.""""You keep using the phrase 'bite my head off.' Now when you say 'bite my head off,' I take it I can assume that this is actually some kind of metaphorical statement, implying that you'll shout at me, perhaps rather angrily?""""Bite your head off. Then crunch it. Then chew it. Then swallow it,"" said Tiger. ""Neither of us can leave until Anansi's child forgets we're here. The way that bastard seems to have arranged things, even if I kill you in the morning you'll be reincarnated back in this blasted cave by the end of the afternoon. So don't irritate me.""The small white animal said, ""Ah well. Another day - """"If you say 'another dollar,' "" said Tiger, ""I will be irritated, and there will be serious consequences. Don't. Say anything. Irritating. Do you understand?""There was a brief silence in the cave at the end of the world. It was broken by a small, weasely voice saying, ""Absatively.""It started to say, ""Oww!"" but the noise was suddenly and effectively silenced.And then there was nothing in that place but the sound of crunching.The thing they don't tell you about coffins in the literature, because frankly it's not much of a selling point to the people who are buying them, is just how comfortable they are.Mr. Nancy was extremely satisfied with his coffin. Now that all the excitement was over, he'd gone back to his coffin and was comfortably dozing. Every once in a while he would wake and remember where he was, then he'd roll over and go back to sleep.The grave, as has been pointed out, is a fine place, not to mention a private one, and is thus an excellent place to get a little downtime. Six feet down, best kind there is. Another twenty years or so, he thought, and he would have to think about getting up.He opened one eye when the funeral started.He could hear them up above him: Callyanne Higgler and the Bustamonte woman and the other one, the thin one, not to mention a small horde of grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren, all of them sighing and wailing and crying their eyes out for the late Mrs. Dunwiddy.Mr. Nancy thought about pushing one hand up through the turf and grabbing Callyanne Higgler's ankle. It was something he'd wanted to do ever since he saw Carrie at a drive-in, thirty years earlier, but now that the opportunity presented itself, he found himself able to resist the temptation. Honestly, he couldn't be bothered. She'd only scream and have a heart attack and die, and then the damn Garden of Rest would get even more crowded than it already was.Too much like hard work, anyway. There were good dreams to be dreamed in the world beneath the soil. Twenty years, he thought. Maybe twenty-five. By that time, he might even have grandchildren. It's always interesting to see how the grandchildren turn out.He could hear Callyanne Higgler wailing and carrying on up above him. Then she stopped her sobbing long enough to announce, ""Still. It's not as if she don't have a good life and a long one. That woman's a hundred and three years old when she passes from us.""""Hunnert and four!"" said an irritated voice from under the ground beside him.Mr. Nancy reached one insubstantial arm out and tapped the new coffin sharply on the side. ""Keep it down, there, woman,"" he barked. ""Some of us is tryin' to sleep.""Rosie had made it clear to Spider that she expected him to get a steady job, the kind that involved getting up in the morning and going somewhere.So one morning, the day before Rosie was to be discharged from the hospital, Spider got up early and went down to the town library. He logged on to the library computer, sauntered onto the Internet and, very carefully, cleared out all Grahame Coats's remaining bank accounts, the ones that the police forces of several continents had so far failed to find. He arranged for the stud farm in Argentina to be sold. He bought a small, off-the-peg company, endowed it with the money, and applied for charitable status. He sent off an e-mail, in the name of Roger Bronstein, hiring a lawyer to administer the foundation's business, and suggested that the lawyer might wish to seek out Miss Rosie Noah, late of London, currently of Saint Andrews, and hire her to Do Good.Rosie was hired. Her first task was to find office space.Following this, Spider spent four full days walking (and, at nights, sleeping on) the beach that circled most of the island, tasting the food in each of the dining establishments he encountered along the way until he came to Dawson's Fish Shack. He tried the fried flying fish, the boiled green figs, the grilled chicken, and the coconut pie, then he went back into the kitchen and found the chef, who was also the owner, and offered him money enough for partnership and cooking lessons.Dawson's Fish Shack is now a restaurant, and Mr. Dawson has retired. Sometimes Spider's out front and sometimes he's back in the kitchen: you go down there and look for him, you'll see him. The food is the best on the island. He's fatter than he used to be, though not as fat as he'll wind up if he keeps tasting everything he cooks.Not that Rosie minds.She does some teaching, and some helping out, and a lot of Doing Good, and if she ever misses London she never lets it show. Rosie's mother, on the other hand, misses London continually and vocally, but takes any suggestion that she might want to return there as an attempt to part her from her as-yet-unborn (and, for that matter, unconceived) grandchildren.Nothing would give this author greater pleasure than to be able to assure you that, following her return from the valley of the shadow of death, Rosie's mother became a new person, a jolly woman with a kind word for everyone, that her newfound appetite for food was only matched by her appetite for life and all if had to offer. Alas, respect for the truth compels perfect honesty and the truth is that when she came out of hospital Rosie's mother was still herself, just as suspicious and uncharitable as ever, although significantly more frail and now given to sleeping with the light on.She announced that she would be selling her flat in London and would move to wherever in the world Spider and Rosie were, to be near her grandchildren; and, as time went on, she would drop pointed comments about the lack of grandchildren, the quantity and motility of Spider's spermatozoa, the frequency and positions of Spider and Rosie's sexual relations, and the relative cheapness and ease of in vitro fertilization, to the point where Spider seriously began to think about not going to bed with Rosie anymore, just to spite Rosie's mother. He thought about this for about eleven seconds one afternoon, while Rosie's mother was handing them photocopies of an article from a magazine that she had found which suggested that Rosie should stand on her head for half an hour after sex; and he mentioned these thoughts to Rosie that night, and she laughed and told him that her mother wasn't allowed in their bedroom anyway, and that she wasn't going to be standing on her head after making love for anybody.Mrs. Noah has a flat in Williamstown, near Spider and Rosie's house, and twice a week one of Callyanne Higgler's many nieces looks in on her, does the vacuuming, dusts the glass fruit (the wax fruit melted in the island heat), and makes a little food and leaves it in the fridge, and sometimes Rosie's mum eats it and sometimes she doesn't.Charlie's a singer these days. He's lost a lot of the softness. He's a lean man now, with a trademark fedora hat. He has lots of different fedoras, in different colors; his favorite one is green.Charlie has a son. His name is Marcus: he is four and a half and possesses that deep gravity and seriousness that only small children and mountain gorillas have ever been able to master.Nobody ever calls Charlie ""Fat Charlie"" anymore, and honestly, sometimes he misses it.It was early in the morning in the summer, and it was already light. There was already noise coming from the room next door. Charlie let Daisy sleep. He climbed out of bed quietly, grabbed a T-shirt and shorts, and went through the door to see his son naked on the floor playing with a small wooden train set. Together they pulled on their T-shirts and shorts and flip-flops, and Charlie put on a hat, and they walked down to the beach.""Daddy?"" said the boy. His jaw was set, and he seemed to be pondering something.""Yes, Marcus?""""Who was the shortest president?""""You mean in height?""""No. In, in days. Who was the shortest.""""Harrison. He caught pneumonia during his inauguration and died. He was president for forty-something days, and he spent most of his time in office dying.""""Oh. Well, who was the longest then?""""Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He served three full terms. Died in office during his fourth. We'll take off our shoes here.""They placed their shoes on a rock and carried on walking down toward the waves, their toes digging into the damp sand.""How do you know so much about presidents?""""Because my father thought it would do me good to find out about them, when I was a kid.""""Oh.""They waded out into the water, making for a boulder, one that could only be seen at low tide. After a while, Charlie picked the boy up and let him ride on his shoulders.""Daddy?""""Yes, Marcus.""""P'choona says you're famous.""""And who's Petunia?""""At playgroup. She says her mom has all your CDs. She says she loves your singing.""""Ah.""""Are you famous?""""Not really. A little bit."" He put Marcus down on the top of the boulder, then he clambered up it himself. ""Okay. Ready to sing?""""Yes.""""What do you want to sing?""""My favorite song.""""I don't know if she'll like that one.""""She will."" Marcus had the certainty of walls, of mountains.""Okay. One, two, three-""They sang ""Yellow Bird"" together, which was Marcus's favorite song that week, and then they sang ""Zombie Jamboree,"" which was his second favorite, and ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain,"" which was his third favorite. Marcus, whose eyes were better than Charlie's, spotted her as they were finishing ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain"" and he began to wave.""There she is, Daddy.""""Are you sure?""The morning haze blurred the sea and sky together into a pale whiteness, and Charlie squinted at the horizon. ""I don't see anything.""""She's gone under the water. She'll be here soon.""There was a splash, and she surfaced immediately below them; with a reach and a flip and a wiggle she was sitting on the rock beside them, her silvery tail dangling down into the Atlantic, flicking beads of water up onto her scales. She had long, orange-red hair.They all sang together now, the man and the boy and the mermaid. They sang ""The Lady Is a Tramp"" and ""Yellow Submarine"" and then Marcus taught the mermaid the words to the Flintstones theme song.""He reminds me of you,"" she said to Charlie, ""when you were a little boy.""""You knew me then?""She smiled. ""You and your father used to walk down the beach, back then. Your father,"" she said. ""He was quite some gentleman."" She sighed. Mermaids sigh better than anyone. Then she said, ""You should go back now. The tide's coming in."" She pushed her long hair back and jackknifed into the ocean. She raised her head above the waves, touched her fingertips to her lips, and blew Marcus a kiss before vanishing under the water.Charlie put his son onto his shoulders, and he waded through the sea, back to the beach, where his son slipped down from his shoulders onto the sand. He took off his old fedora hat and placed it on his son's head. It was much too big for the boy, but it still made him smile.""Hey,"" said Charlie, ""You want to see something?""""Okay. But I want breakfast. I want pancakes. No, I want oatmeal. No, I want pancakes.""""Watch this."" Charlie began to do a sand-dance in his bare feet, soft-shoe shuffling through the sand.""I can do that,"" said Marcus.""Really?""""Watch me, Daddy.""He could, too.Together the man and the boy danced their way back up the sand to the house, singing a wordless song that they made up as they went along, which lingered in the air even after they had gone in for breakfast.

THE ADVENTURES OF SPIDER (ADELETED SCENE)SPIDER WAS IMAGINING HIMSELF ELSEWHEREHe was flicking, in his mind, through places he knew, or remembered, or imagined, willing himself there. Nothing happened. He remained precisely where he was, held by the chain of bones in his feathered cell.He tried doing it the other way, thinking of a person, and trying to make himself be with them. This tended to be a fairly unreliable method of travel for Spider at the best of times: Spider had trouble with other people. He had trouble remembering their faces or their names, or sometimes even that they really existed at all.He thought about Fat Charlie; he thought of old girlfriends, but they seemed peculiarly unconvincing, reconfiguring in his head into an assembly of breasts and lips and skin and smiles, and they evaporated in his mind; last of all, he thought of Rosie. He thought of her eyes, her warmth, the curve of her nostrils, the smell of her hair.(And on a cruise ship, dozing by the pool, Rosie shifted uncomfortably.)Well, thought Spider, if he could not get out one way, he would get out another. There was more than one way to skin a cat, after all1.He tried changing shape, with no result. He tried shouting. He tried shouting some more.There was a flapping noise. Two sandhill cranes stood in front of him. They looked at him curiously.It's not impossible to be Spider, or something like him. All you need is a complete and utter certainty that everything will work out; a cocky assurance that's just a hair's breadth away from psychosis; the conviction that you're a monstrously clever fellow, and that the universe always looks after its own.""You know,"" said Spider to the birds, ""I don't want to cause a problem but these chains are a bit loose. One solid tug and I could fall down.""The birds might have looked concerned. Spider couldn't be sure. It's hard to tell with birds.""It's a shocking job,"" said Spider. ""Whoever made these chains should be properly ashamed of themselves. Frankly, I could get out of them in a couple of minutes, and think of the trouble you'd all be with herself if I simply fell out of them and wandered off. Quite appalling workmanship.""The cranes looked at each other. One of them strutted back towards the wall. Spider watched it - a jog to the left, then it reached out its beak to the wall, and it touched a feather there, a feather paler than the others. And then it was gone.""You know,"" said Spider to the remaining crane. ""Let's just pretend I didn't say anything. I'd hate to put you all to any bother.""A fluttering, and now the space was filled with huge crows who landed on the bone chains, then strutted about like builders examining the work of quite a different firm of builders, one that had left town with the work left incomplete. They cawed and tokked in what Spider was certain was the corvine equivalent of ""So what sort of cowboy put this together than?""A word from their foreman and the chains were covered in crows, pecking and clawing at the bones, tapping and prodding with black beaks against the bones. A loud caw and the chains fell apart - the bones tumbled to the floor, and Spider tumbled with them. The floor was littered with twigs and tiny feathers, splashed and speckled with birdshit.Spider got to his feet, and noticed, for the first time, the geese. There were five of them, and they surrounded him, pecking at him, honking and hissing, to ensure that he stayed in the centre of them. A goose with its dander up and its neck down can cow a Doberman with a hiss, and these were the geese of nightmares.Spider smiled at them.Beneath the clever beaks of the crows the bone chains were expertly reassembled. The geese began to lower their necks once more, honking and hissing, pushing Spider back to where the chains were waiting.""Hey,"" he said to the geese.""Just give me room to breathe. I'm going back.Yeah?""He turned where the chains hung, waiting for him, he counted to three, and then he turned and swung himself back toward the wall, where the sandhill crane had vanished. In the dim light he lunged for one feather paler than the others, and he hoped.The wall became thin, almost translucent, and he pushed through it triumphantly, with angry geese pecking at his heels, and realised, as he did so, that he might have made a slight mistake.Somehow, he had assumed that the cell was deep in the earth - that's where people build cells, after all. But on the whole, birds don't burrow. The tree was enormous, higher than a giant redwood, and it was filled with a rookery of nests, including, just above him, the nest from which he had escaped. Below him approaching with the speed of an out-of-control sports car, was the ground.""Not a problem,"" Spider told himself.Again he tried to shift his location, with no more luck or success than before. Again he tried to change his shape - a little brown spider would simply have flown away on the air currents. Nothing happened, only the ground was rather closer.Still, he thought, if he couldn't move and he couldn't change, the odds were that whatever kind of a place he was in, it wasn't a real place. It was made of mind, not world. As long as he was able to bear in mind that this was Maya, was illusion, he thought, he would be fine. The cold air rushed past him. He spread his arms and his legs.The cold air rushed past him.And then he hit the ground. ""It's not real,"" he thought, as the air was knocked out of him, and, for a moment, everything went dark.Spider picked himself up. He hurt, all over, but nothing seemed to be broken.He wondered if he had his own pocket universe somewhere, hung with webs and scuttling, industrious, storytelling spiders. He did not know. He was not sure where to look for it, if he did have one. His father would have known, of course-The sky was the colour of beaten copper, and the earth was sandy and grey, and everything smelled of cinnamon and nutmeg.There had to be a way out.That was obvious.Ways in, ways out. He picked a direction, and did not run. Instead, he strolled, but he covered a lot of ground like that. Spider strolled like some people zoomed.There was a large bird on a bush looking at him. The bird said, ""Spider.You know you're never going to escape from here.""Spider said, ""I'll bet you all I own that I shall. And that you'll show me how to get away.""Birds can't smirk, they don't have the equipment, but this one almost managed it. ""All you own?""""Everything, if you don't show me the way out. So please, show me the way out of here.""""Never,"" said the bird.""Close your eyes,"" said Spider, ""And count to ten. I promise that by the time you've finished counting you'll have pointed me to the way out of here.""The bird closed its eyes. ""One,"" it said. ""Two. Three. Four.""With one twist, Spider broke its neck, and it stopped counting. ""Still, I wouldn't want you to think me a liar,"" said Spider to the bird. He plucked it, and set the feathers to one side, then he made a small fire in the earth, roasted and ate the meat, cleaned off the bones, and, last of all, he cast the bones onto the sand.They fell higgledy-piggledy, every which way. Spider scooped them up again. ""Remember,"" he said, ""You can't lie when you're dead. ""This time when he cast the bones they pointed unequivocally in one direction.""That's what I like,"" said Spider. ""Someone who honours his bets.""He put the bird's feathers on, and walked to the top of a hill. Ahead of him was a tear in the sky, a small rip in the coppery fabric of everything, and darkness spilled through it, and behind the darkness stars were twinkling. Spider no longer cared that it was uncool to run. Now he ran.As he reached the bottom of the hill, birds descended around him.""Stop!"" they called.He stopped. ""I'm a bird,"" he told them. ""Just like you."" Even in the Bird Woman's universe, he was certain that he had enough conviction to make the things he said true for those that heard them.""What manner of bird are you?"" asked a heron, puzzled. ""An emu? An ostrich? A moa?""""Yeah. Sure. Something like that,"" said Spider. ""Hey, have any of you seen Spider anywhere? I heard that he had escaped, and I was told to guard the way out of here.""""We're looking for him too,"" said an eagle. ""Haven't seen him, though. Actually, we thought you might be him, when we saw you coming towards us.""""No, you didn't,"" said Spider. ""You thought I was just another bird.""""Oh. Right. That was what we thought,"" agreed the heron.""So. You lot all wait here, and guard the way out,"" said Spider. ""And I'll just put my head through there and make sure that he hasn't got here ahead of us.""Spider walked forward. He walked through the rip in the sky.Ahead of him he could see an island. He could see a small mountain in the centre of the island. He could see a pure blue sky, and swaying palm trees, a white gull high in the sky. But even as he saw it the world seemed to be receding. It was as if he was looking at it through the wrong end of a telescope. It shrank and slipped from him, and the more he ran towards it the further away it seemed to get.The island was a reflection in a puddle of water, and then it was nothing at all.He was in a cave.The edges of things were crisp - crisper and sharper than anywhere that Spider had ever been before. This was a different kind of place.The feather she had worn fell to the rocky floor. He turned to the daylight.She was standing in the mouth of the cave, between him and the open air. She had stared into his face in a Greek Restaurant in South London, and birds had come from her mouth.""You know,"" said Spider, ""I was just in your world. And I have to say, you've got the strangest ideas about hospitality. You come to my world, I'd make you dinner, open a bottle of wine, put on some soft music, give you an evening you would never forget.""Her face was impassive; carved from black rock it was. The wind tugged at the edges of her old brown coat. She spoke then, her voice high and distant as the wrenching call of a distant gull.""I took you,"" she said. ""Now, you will call him.""""Call him? Call who?""""You will bleat,"" she said."" You will whimper. Your fear will excite him.""""Spider does not bleat,"" he said. He was not certain it was true.Eyes as black and as shiny as chips of obsidian stared back into his. They were eyes like black holes, letting nothing out, not even information.""If you kill me,"" said Spider, ""my curse will be upon you."" He wondered if he actually had a curse. He probably did.""It will not be I that kills you,"" she said. She raised her hand, and it was not a hand but a raptor's talon. She raked her talon down his face, down his chest, her cruel claws sinking into his flesh, ripping his skin.It did not hurt, although Spider knew that it would hurt soon enough.Beads of blood crimsoned his chest and dripped down his face. His eyes stung. His blood touched his lips. He could taste it and smell the iron scent of it.""Now,"" she said in the cries of distant birds. ""Now your death begins.""Spider said, ""We're both reasonable entities. Let me present you with a perhaps rather more feasible alternative scenario that might conceivably have benefits for both of us."" He said it with an easy smile. He said it convincingly.""You talk too much,"" she said. Then she reached into his mouth with her sharp talons, and with one wrenching movement she tore out his tongue.""There,"" she said. And then she said, ""Sleep.""The EndThis file was created with BookDesigner programbookdesigner@the-ebook.org7/13/2010LRS to LRF parser v.0.9; Mikhail Sharonov, 2006; msh-tools.com/ebook/

AB_ch5	AB	Anansi Boys	5	7819	44264	CHAPTER FIVEIN WHICH WE EXAMINE THE MANY CONSEQUENCES OF THE MORNING AFTERFat Charlie was thirsty.Fat Charlie was thirsty and his head hurt.Fat Charlie was thirsty and his head hurt and his mouth tasted evil and his eyes were too tight in his head and all his teeth twinged and his stomach burned and his back was aching in a way that started around his knees and went up to his forehead and his brains had been removed and replaced with cotton balls and needles and pins which was why it hurt to try and think, and his eyes were not just too tight in his head but they must have rolled out in the night and been reattached with roofing nails; and now he noticed that anything louder than the gentle Brownian motion of air molecules drifting softly past each other was above his pain threshold. Also, he wished he were dead.Fat Charlie opened his eyes, which was a mistake, in that it let daylight in, which hurt. It also told him where he was (in his own bed, in his bedroom), and because he was staring at the clock on his bedside table, it told him that the time was11:30.That, he thought, one word at a time, was about as bad as things could get: he had the kind of hangover that an Old Testament God might have smitten the Midianites with, and the next time he saw Grahame Coats he would undoubtedly learn that he had been fired.He wondered if he could sound convincingly sick over the phone, then realized that the challenge would be convincingly sounding anything else.He could not remember getting home last night.He would phone the office, the moment he was able to remember the telephone number. He would apologize - crippling twenty-four-hour flu, flat on his back, nothing that could be done-.""You know,"" said someone in the bed next to him, ""I think there's a bottle of water on your side. Could you pass it over here?""Fat Charlie wanted to explain that there was no water on his side of the bed, and that there was, in fact, no water closer than the bathroom sink, if he disinfected the toothbrush mug first, but he realized he was staring at one of several bottles of water, sitting on the bedside table. He reached his hand out, and closed fingers that felt like they belonged to someone else around one of them, then, with the sort of effort people usually reserve for hauling themselves up the final few feet of a sheer rock face, he rolled over in bed.It was the vodka and orange.Also, she was naked. At least, the bits of her he could see were.She took the water, and pulled the sheet up to cover her chest. ""Ta. He said to tell you,"" she said, ""when you woke, not to worry about calling work and telling them you were ill. He said to tell you he's already taken care of it.""Fat Charlie's mind was not put at rest. His fears and worries were not allayed. Then again, in the condition he was in, he only had room in his head for a single thing to worry about at once, and right now he was worrying about whether or not he would make it to the bathroom in time.""You'll need more liquids,"" said the girl. ""You'll need to replenish your electrolytes.""Fat Charlie made it to the bathroom in time. Afterward, seeing he was there already, he stood under the shower until the room stopped undulating, and then he brushed his teeth without throwing up.When he returned to the bedroom, the vodka and orange was no longer there, which was a relief to Fat Charlie, who had started to hope that she might have been an alcohol-induced delusion, like pink elephants or the nightmarish idea that he had taken to the stage to sing on the previous evening.He could not find his dressing gown, so he pulled on a tracksuit, in order to feel dressed enough to visit the kitchen, at the far end of the hall.His phone chimed, and he rummaged through his jacket, which was on the floor beside the bed, until he found it, and flipped it open. He grunted into it, as anonymously as he could, just in case it was someone from the Grahame Coats Agency trying to discern his whereabouts.""It's me,"" said Spider's voice. ""Everything's okay.""""You told them I was dead?""""Better than that. I told them I was you.""""But."" Fat Charlie tried to think clearly. ""But you're not me.""""Hey. I know that. I told them I was.""""You don't even look like me.""""Brother of mine, you are harshing a potential mellow here. It's all taken care of. Oops. Gotta go. The big boss needs to talk to me.""""Grahame Coats? Look, Spider -""But Spider had put down the phone, and the screen blanked.Fat Charlie's dressing gown came through the door. There was a girl inside it. It looked significantly better on her than it ever had on him. She was carrying a tray, on which was a water glass with a fizzing Alka-Seltzer in it, along with something in a mug.""Drink both of these,"" she told him. ""The mug first. Just knock it back.""""What's in the mug?""""Egg yolk, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, salt, dash of vodka, things like that,"" she said. ""Kill or cure. Now,"" she told him, in tones that brooked no argument. ""Drink.""Fat Charlie drank.""Oh my god,"" he said.""Yeah,"" she agreed. ""But you're still alive.""He wasn't sure about that. He drank the Alka-Seltzer anyway. Something occurred to him.""Um,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Um. Look. Last night. Did we. Um.""She looked blank.""Did we what?""""Did we. You know. Do it?""""You mean you don't remember?"" Her face fell. ""You said it was the best you'd ever had. That it was as if you'd never made love to a woman before. You were part god, part animal, and part unstoppable sex machine-.""Fat Charlie didn't know where to look. She giggled.""I'm just winding you up,"" she said. ""I'd helped your brother get you home, we cleaned you up, and, after that, you know.""""No,"" he said. ""I don't know.""""Well,"" she said, ""you were completely out cold, and it's a big bed. I'm not sure where your brother slept. He must have the constitution of an ox. He was up at the crack of dawn, all bright and smiling.""""He went into work,"" said Fat Charlie. ""He told them he was me.""""Wouldn't they be able to tell the difference? I mean, you're not exactly twins.""""Apparently not."" He shook his head. Then he looked at her. She stuck out a small, extremely pink tongue at him.""What's your name?""""You mean you've forgotten? I remember your name. You're Fat Charlie.""""Charles,"" he said. ""Just Charles is fine.""""I'm Daisy,"" she said, and stuck out her hand. ""Pleased to meet you.""They shook hands solemnly.""I feel a bit better,"" said Fat Charlie.""Like I said,"" she said. ""Kill or cure.""Spider was having a great day at the office. He almost never worked in offices. He almost never worked. Everything was new, everything was marvelous and strange, from the tiny lift that lurched him up to the fifth floor, to the warren-like offices of the Grahame Coats Agency. He stared, fascinated, at the glass case in the lobby filled with dusty awards. He wandered through the offices, and when anyone asked him who he was, he would say ""I'm Fat Charlie Nancy,"" and he'd say it in his god-voice, which would make whatever he said practically true.He found the tea-room, and made himself several cups of tea. Then he carried them back to Fat Charlie's desk, and arranged them around it in an artistic fashion. He started to play with the computer network. It asked him for a password. ""I'm Fat Charlie Nancy,"" he told the computer, but there were still places it didn't want him to go, so he said ""I'm Grahame Coats,"" and it opened to him like a flower.He looked at things on the computer until he got bored.He dealt with the contents of Fat Charlie's in basket. He dealt with Fat Charlie's pending basket.It occurred to him that Fat Charlie would be waking up around now, so he called him at home, in order to reassure him; he just felt that he was making a little headway when Grahame Coats put his head around the door, ran his fingers across his stoatlike lips, and beckoned.""Gotta go,"" Spider said to his brother. ""The big boss needs to talk to me."" He put down the phone.""Making private phone calls on company time, Nancy,"" stated Grahame Coats.""Abso-friggin'-lutely,"" agreed Spider.""And was that myself you were referring to as 'the big boss'?"" asked Grahame Coats. They walked to the end of the hallway and into his office.""You're the biggest,"" said Spider. ""And the bossest.""Grahame Coats looked puzzled; he suspected he was being made fun of, but he was not certain, and this disturbed him.""Well, sit ye down, sit ye down,"" he said.Spider sat him down.It was Grahame Coats's custom to keep the turnover of staff at the Grahame Coats Agency fairly constant. Some people came and went. Others came and remained until just before their jobs would begin to carry some kind of employment protection. Fat Charlie had been there longer than anyone: one year and eleven months. One month to go before redundancy payments or industrial tribunals could become a part of his life.There was a speech that Grahame Coats gave, before he fired someone. He was very proud of his speech.""Into each life,"" he began, ""a little rain must fall. There's no cloud without a silver lining.""""It's an ill wind,"" offered Spider, ""that blows no one good.""""Ah. Yes. Yes indeed. Well. As we pass through this vale of tears, we must pause to reflect that -""""The first cut,"" said Spider, ""is the deepest.""""What? Oh."" Grahame Coats scrabbled to remember what came next. ""Happiness,"" he pronounced, ""is like a butterfly.""""Or a bluebird,"" agreed Spider.""Quite. If I may finish?""""Of course. Be my guest,"" said Spider, cheerfully.""And the happiness of every soul at the Grahame Coats Agency is as important to me as my own.""""I cannot tell you,"" said Spider, ""how happy that makes me.""""Yes,"" said Grahame Coats.""Well, I better get back to work,"" said Spider. ""It's been a blast, though. Next time you want to share some more, just call me. You know where I am.""""Happiness,"" said Grahame Coats. His voice was taking on a faintly strangulated quality. ""And what I wonder, Nancy, Charles, is this - are you happy here? And do you not agree that you might be rather happier elsewhere?""""That's not what I wonder,"" said Spider. ""You want to know what I wonder?""Grahame Coats said nothing. It had never gone like this before. Normally, at this point, their faces fell, and they went into shock. Sometimes they cried. Grahame Coats had never minded when they cried.""What I wonder,"" said Spider, ""is what the accounts in the Cayman Islands are for. You know, because it almost sort of looks like money that should go to our client accounts sometimes just goes into the Cayman Island accounts instead. And it seems a funny sort of way to organize the finances, for the money coming in to rest in those accounts. I've never seen anything like it before. I was hoping you could explain it to me.""Grahame Coats had gone off-white - one of those colors that turn up in paint catalogs with names like ""parchment"" or ""magnolia."" He said, ""How did you get access to those accounts?""""Computers,"" said Spider. ""Do they drive you as nuts as they drive me? What can you do?""Grahame Coats thought for several long moments. He had always liked to imagine that his financial affairs were so deeply tangled that, even if the Fraud Squad were ever able to conclude that financial crimes had been committed, they would find it extremely difficult to explain to a jury exactly what kind of crimes they were.""There's nothing illegal about having offshore accounts,"" he said, as carelessly as possible.""Illegal?"" said Spider. ""I should hope not. I mean, if I saw anything illegal, I should have to report it to the appropriate authorities.""Grahame Coats picked up a pen from his desk, then he put it down again. ""Ah,"" he said. ""Well, delightful though it is to chat, converse, spend time, and otherwise hobnob with you, Charles, I suspect that both of us have work we should be getting on with. Time and tide, after all, wait for no man. Procrastination is the thief of time.""""Life is a rock,"" suggested Spider, ""but the radio rolled me.""""Whatever.""Fat Charlie was starting to feel human again. He was no longer in pain; slow, intimate waves of nausea were no longer sweeping over him. While he was not yet convinced that the world was a fine and joyous place, he was no longer in the ninth circle of hangover hell, and this was a good thing.Daisy had taken over the bathroom. He had listened to the taps running, and then to some contented splashes.He knocked on the bathroom door.""I'm in here,"" said Daisy. ""I'm in the bath.""""I know,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I mean, I didn't know, but I thought you probably were.""""Yes?"" said Daisy.""I just wondered,"" he said, through the door. ""I wondered why you came back here. Last night.""""Well,"" she said. ""You were a bit the worse for wear. And your brother looked like he needed a hand. I'm not working this morning, so. Voilà.""""Voilà,"" said Fat Charlie. On the one hand, she felt sorry for him. And on the other, she really liked Spider. Yes. He'd only had a brother for a little over a day, and already he felt there would be no surprises left in this new family relationship. Spider was the cool one; he was the other one.She said, ""You have a lovely voice.""""What?""""You were singing in the taxi, when we were going home. Unforgettable. It was lovely.""He had somehow put the karaoke incident out of his mind, placed it in the dark places one disposes of inconvenient things. Now it came back, and he wished it hadn't.""You were great,"" she said. ""Will you sing to me later?""Fat Charlie thought desperately, and then was saved from thinking desperately by the doorbell.""Someone at the door,"" he said.He went downstairs and opened the door and things got worse. Rosie's mother gave him a look that would have curdled milk. She said nothing. She was holding a large white envelope.""Hello,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Mrs. Noah. Nice to see you. Um.""She sniffed and held the envelope in front of her. ""Oh,"" she said. ""You're here. So. You going to invite me in?""That's right, thought Fat Charlie. Your kind always have to be invited. Just say no, and she'll have to go away. ""Of course, Mrs. Noah. Please, come in."" So that's how vampires do it. ""Would you like a cup of tea?""""Don't think you can get around me like that,"" she said. ""Because you can't.""""Er. Right.""Up the narrow stairs and into the kitchen. Rosie's mother looked around and made a face as if to indicate that it did not meet her standards of hygiene, containing, as it did, edible foodstuffs. ""Coffee? Water?"" Don't say wax fruit. ""Wax fruit?"" Damn.""I understand from Rosie that your father recently passed away,"" she said.""Yes. He did.""""When Rosie's father passed, they did a four-page obituary in Cooks and Cookery. They said he was solely responsible for the arrival of Caribbean fusion cuisine in this country.""""Oh,"" he said.""It's not like he left me badly off, neither. He had life insurance, and he owned a share of two successful restaurants. I'm a very well-off woman. When I die, it will all go to Rosie.""""When we're married,"" said Fat Charlie, ""I'll be looking after her. Don't you worry.""""I'm not saying you're only after Rosie for my money,"" said Rosie's mother, in a tone of voice that made it clear that that was exactly what she did believe.Fat Charlie's headache started coming back. ""Mrs. Noah, is there anything I can help you with?""""I've been talking to Rosie, and we've decided that I should start helping with your wedding plans,"" she said, primly. ""I need a list of your people. The ones you were hoping to invite. Names, addresses, e-mail, and phone numbers. I've made a form for you to fill out. I thought I'd save on postage and drop it off myself, since I was going to be passing by Maxwell Gardens anyway. I was not expecting to find you home."" She handed him the large white envelope. ""There will be a total of ninety people at the wedding. You will be permitted a total of eight family members and six personal friends. The personal friends and four members will comprise Table H. The rest of your group will be at Table C. Your father would have been seated with us at the head table, but seeing that he has passed over, we have allocated his seat to Rosie's Aunt Winifred. Have you decided on your best man yet?""Fat Charlie shook his head.""Well, when you do, make certain he knows that there won't be any crude stuff in his speech. I don't want to hear anything from your best man I wouldn't hear in a church. You understand me?""Fat Charlie wondered what Rosie's mother would usually hear in a church. Probably just cries of ""Back! Foul beast of Hell!"" followed by gasps of ""Is it alive?"" and a nervous inquiry as to whether anybody had remembered to bring the stakes and hammers.""I think,"" said Fat Charlie, ""I have more than ten relations. I mean, there are cousins and great-aunts and things.""""What you obviously fail to grasp,"" said Rosie's mother, ""is that weddings cost money. I've allocated £175 a person to tables A to D - Table A is the head table - which takes care of Rosie's closest relations and my women's club, and £125to tables E to G, which are, you know, more distant acquaintances, the children and so on and so forth.""""You said my friends would be at Table H,"" said Fat Charlie.""That's the next tier down. They won't be getting the avocado shrimp starters or the sherry trifle.""""When Rosie and I talked about it last, we thought we'd go for a sort of a general West Indian theme to the food.""Rosie's mother sniffed. ""She sometimes doesn't know her own mind, that girl. But she and I are now in full agreement.""""Look,"" said Fat Charlie, ""I think maybe I ought to talk to Rosie about all this and get back to you.""""Just fill out the forms,"" said Rosie's mother. Then she said suspiciously, ""Why aren't you at work?""""I'm. Um. I'm not in. That is to say, I'm off this morning. Not going in today. I'm. Not.""""I hope you told Rosie that. She was planning to see you for lunch, she told me. That was why she could not have lunch with me.""Fat Charlie took this information in. ""Right,"" he said. ""Well, thanks for popping over, Mrs. Noah. I'll talk to Rosie, and -""Daisy came into the kitchen. She wore a towel wrapped around her head, and Fat Charlie's dressing gown, which clung to her damp body. She said ""There's orange juice, isn't there? I know I saw some, when I was poking around before. How's your head? Any better?"" She opened the fridge door, and poured herself a tall glass of orange juice.Rosie's mother cleared her throat. It did not sound like a throat being cleared. It sounded like pebbles rattling down a beach.""Hullo,"" said Daisy. ""I'm Daisy.""The temperature in the kitchen began to drop. ""Indeed?"" said Rosie's mother. Icicles hung from the final D.""I wonder what they would have called oranges,"" said Fat Charlie into the silence, ""if they weren't orange. I mean, if they were some previously unknown blue fruit, would they have been called blues? Would we be drinking blue juice?""""What?"" asked Rosie's mother.""Bless. You should hear the things that come out of your mouth,"" said Daisy, cheerfully. ""Right. I'm going to see if I can find my clothes. Lovely meeting you.""She went out. Fat Charlie did not resume breathing.""Who,"" said Rosie's mother, perfectly calmly. ""Was. That.""""My sis - cousin. My cousin,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I just think of her as my sister. We were very close, growing up. She just decided to crash here last night. She's a bit of a wild child. Well. Yes. You'll see her at the wedding.""""I'll put her down for Table H,"" said Rosie's mother. ""She'll be more comfortable there."" She said it in the same way most people would say things like, ""Do you wish to die quickly, or shall I let Mongo have his fun first?""""Right,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Well,"" he said. ""Lovely to see you. Well,"" he said, ""you must have lots of things to be getting on with. And,"" he said, ""I need to be getting to work.""""I thought you had the day off.""""Morning. I've got the morning off. And it's nearly over. And I should be getting off to work now so good-bye.""She clutched her handbag to her, and she stood up. Fat Charlie followed her out into the hall.""Lovely seeing you,"" he said.She blinked, as a nictitating python might blink before striking. ""Good-bye Daisy,"" she called. ""I'll see you at the wedding.""Daisy, now wearing panties and a bra, and in the process of pulling on a T-shirt, leaned out into the hall. ""Take care,"" she said, and went back into Fat Charlie's bedroom.Rosie's mother said nothing else as Fat Charlie led her down the stairs. He opened the door for her, and as she went past him, he saw on her face something terrible, something that made his stomach knot more than it was knotting already: the thing that Rosie's mother was doing with her mouth. It was pulled up at the corners in a ghastly rictus. Like a skull with lips, Rosie's mother was smiling.He closed the door behind her and he stood and shivered in the downstairs hall. Then, like a man going to the electric chair, he went back up the hall steps.""Who was that?"" asked Daisy, who was now almost dressed.""My fiancée's mother.""""She's a real bundle of joy, isn't she?"" She dressed in the same clothes she had worn the previous night.""You going to work like that?""""Oh, bless. No, I'll go home and change. This isn't how I look at work, anyway. Can you ring a taxi?""""Where are you headed?""""Hendon.""He called a local taxi service. Then he sat on the floor in the hallway and contemplated various future scenarios, all of them uncontemplatable.Someone was standing next to him. ""I've got some B vitamins in my bag,"" she said. ""Or you could try sucking on a spoonful of honey. It's never done anything for me, but my flatmate swears by it for hangovers.""""It's not that,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I told her you were my cousin. So she wouldn't think you were my, that we, you know, a strange girl in the apartment, all that.""""Cousin, is it? Well, not to worry. She'll probably forget all about me, and if she doesn't, tell her I left the country mysteriously. You'll never see me again.""""Really? Promise?""""You don't have to sound so pleased about it.""A car horn sounded in the street outside. ""That'll be my taxi. Stand up and say good-bye.""He stood up.""Not to worry,"" she said. She hugged him.""I think my life is over,"" he said.""No. It's not.""""I'm doomed.""""Thanks,"" she said. And she leaned up, and she kissed him on the lips, longer and harder than could possibly fit within the bounds of recent introduction. Then she smiled, and walked jauntily down the stairs and let herself out.""This,"" said Fat Charlie out loud when the door closed, ""probably isn't really happening.""He could still taste her on his lips, all orange juice and raspberries. That was a kiss. That was a serious kiss. There was an oomph behind the kiss that he had never in his whole life had before, not even from -""Rosie,"" he said.He flipped open his phone, and speed-dialed her.""This is Rosie's phone,"" said Rosie's voice. ""I'm busy, or I've lost the phone again. And you're in voice mail. Try me at home or leave me a message.""Fat Charlie closed the phone. Then he put on his coat over his tracksuit and, wincing just a little at the terrible unblinking daylight, he went out into the street.Rosie Noah was worried, which in itself worried her. It was, as so many things in Rosie's world were, whether she would admit it to herself or not, Rosie's mother's fault.Rosie had become quite used to a world in which her mother hated the idea of her marrying Fat Charlie Nancy. She took her mother's opposition to the marriage as a sign from the heavens that she was probably doing something right, even when she was not entirely sure in her own mind that this was actually the case.And she loved him, of course. He was solid, reassuring, sane-.Her mother's about-turn on the matter of Fat Charlie had Rosie worried, and her mother's sudden enthusiasm for wedding organization troubled her deeply.She had phoned Fat Charlie the previous night to discuss the matter, but he was not answering his phones. Rosie thought perhaps he had had an early night.It was why she was giving up her lunchtime to talk to him.The Grahame Coats Agency occupied the top floor of a gray Victorian building in the Aldwych, and was at the top of five flights of stairs. There was a lift, though, an antique elevator which had been installed a hundred years before by theatrical agent Rupert ""Binky"" Butterworth. It was an extremely small, slow, juddery lift whose design and function peculiarities only became comprehensible when you discovered that Binky Butter-worth had possessed the size, shape, and ability to squeeze into small spaces of a portly young hippopotamus, and had designed the lift to fit, at a squeeze, Binky Butterworth and one other, much slimmer, person: a chorus girl, for example, or a chorus boy - Binky was not picky. All it took to make Binky happy was someone seeking theatrical representation squeezed into the lift with him, and a very slow and juddery journey up all six stories to the top. It was often the case that by the time he reached the top floor, Binky would be so overcome by the pressures of the journey that he would need to go and have a little lie-down, leaving the chorus girl or chorus boy to cool his or her heels in the waiting room, concerned that the red-faced panting and uncontrolled gasping for breath that Binky had been suffering from as they reached the final floors meant that he had been having some kind of early Edwardian embolism.People would go into the lift with Binky Butterworth once, but after that they used the stairs.Grahame Coats, who had purchased the remains of the Butterworth Agency from Binky's granddaughter more than twenty years before, maintained the lift was part of history.Rosie slammed the inner accordion door, closed the outer door, and went into reception, where she told the receptionist she wanted to see Charles Nancy. She sat down beneath the photographs of Grahame Coats with people he had represented - she recognized Morris Livingstone, the comedian, some once famous boy-bands, and a clutch of sports stars who had, in their later years, become ""personalities"" - the kind who got as much fun out of life as they could until a new liver became available.A man came into reception. He did not look much like Fat Charlie. He was darker, and he was smiling as if he were amused by everything - deeply, dangerously amused.""I'm Fat Charlie Nancy,"" said the man.Rosie walked over to Fat Charlie and gave him a peck on the cheek. He said, ""Do I know you?"" which was an odd thing to say, and then he said, ""Of course I do. You're Rosie. And you get more beautiful every day,"" and he kissed her back, touching his lips to hers. Their lips only brushed, but Rosie's heart began to beat like Binky Butterworth's after a particularly juddery lift journey pressed up against a chorine.""Lunch,"" squeaked Rosie. ""Passing. Thought maybe we could. Talk.""""Yeah,"" said the man who Rosie now thought of as Fat Charlie. ""Lunch.""He put a comfortable arm around Rosie. ""Anywhere you want to go for lunch?""""Oh,"" she said. ""Just. Wherever you want."" It was the way he smelled, she thought. Why had she never before noticed how much she liked the way he smelled?""We'll find somewhere,"" he said. ""Shall we take the stairs?""""If it's all the same to you,"" she said, ""I think I'd rather take the lift.""She banged home the accordion door, and they rode down to street level slowly and shakily, pressed up against each other.Rosie couldn't remember the last time she had been so happy.When they got out onto the street Rosie's phone beeped to let her know she had missed a call. She ignored it.They went into the first restaurant they came to. Until the previous month it had been a high-tech sushi restaurant, with a conveyor belt that ran around the room carrying small raw fishy nibbles priced according to plate color. The Japanese restaurant had gone out of business and had been instantly replaced, in the way of London restaurants, by a Hungarian restaurant, which had kept the conveyor belt as a high-tech addition to the world of Hungarian cuisine, which meant that rapidly cooling bowls of goulash, paprika dumplings, and pots of sour cream made their way in stately fashion around the room.Rosie didn't think it was going to catch on.""Where were you last night?"" she asked.""I went out,"" he said. ""With my brother.""""You're an only child,"" she said.""I'm not. It turns out I'm half of a matched set.""""Really? Is this more of your dad's legacy?""""Honey,"" said the man she thought of as Fat Charlie, ""you don't know the half of it.""""Well,"" she said. ""I hope he'll be coming to the wedding.""""I don't believe he would miss it for the world."" He closed his hand around hers, and she nearly dropped her goulash spoon. ""What are you doing for the rest of the afternoon?""""Not much. Things are practically dead back at the office right now. Couple of fund-raising phone calls to make, but they can wait. Is there. Um. Were you. Um. Why?""""It's such a beautiful day. Do you want to go for a walk?""""That,"" said Rosie, ""would be quite lovely.""They wandered down to the Embankment and began to walk along the northern back of the Thames, a slow, hand-in-hand amble, talking about nothing much in particular.""What about your work?"" asked Rosie, when they stopped to buy an ice cream.""Oh,"" he said. ""They won't mind. They probably won't even notice that I'm not there.""Fat Charlie ran up the stairs to the Grahame Coats Agency. He always took the stairs. It was healthier, for a start, and it meant he would never again have to worry about finding himself wedged into the lift with someone else, too close to pretend they weren't there.He walked into reception, panting slightly. ""Has Rosie been in, Annie?""""Did you lose her?"" said the receptionist.He walked back to his office. His desk was peculiarly tidy. The clutter of undealt-with correspondence was gone. There was a yellow Post-it note on his computer screen, with ""See me. GC"" on it.He knocked on Grahame Coats's office door. This time a voice said, ""Yes?""""It's me,"" he said.""Yes,"" said Grahame Coats. ""Come ye in, Master Nancy. Pull up a pew. I've been giving our conversation of this morning a great deal of thought. And it seems to me that I have misjudged you. You have been working here, for, how long-?""""Nearly two years.""""You have been working long and hard. And now your father's sad passing-.""""I didn't really know him.""""Ah. Brave soul, Nancy. Given that it is currently the fallow season, how would you react to an offer of a couple of weeks off? With, I hardly need to add, full pay?""""Full pay?"" said Fat Charlie.""Full pay, but, yes, I see your point. Spending money. I'm sure you could do with a little spending money, couldn't you?""Fat Charlie tried to work out what universe he was in. ""Am I being fired?""Grahame Coats laughed then, like a weasel with a sharp bone stuck in its throat. ""Absatively not. Quite the reverse. In fact I believe,"" he said, ""that we now understand each other perfectly. Your job is safe and sound. Safe as houses. As long as you remain the model of circumspection and discretion you have been so far.""""How safe are houses?"" asked Fat Charlie.""Extremely safe.""""It's just that I read somewhere that most accidents occur in the home.""""Then,"" said Grahame Coats, ""I think it vitally important that you are encouraged to return to your own house with all celerity."" He handed Fat Charlie a piece of rectangular paper. ""Here,"" he said. ""A small thank-you for two years of devoted service to the Grahame Coats Agency."" Then, because it was what he always said when he gave people money, ""Don't spend it all at once.""Fat Charlie looked at the piece of paper. It was a check. ""Two thousand pounds. Gosh. I mean, I won't.""Grahame Coats smiled at Fat Charlie. If there was triumph in that smile, Fat Charlie was too puzzled, too shaken, too bemused to see it.""Go well,"" said Grahame Coats.Fat Charlie went back to his office.Grahame Coats leaned around the door, casually, like a mongoose leaning idly against a snake-den. ""An idle question. If, while you are off enjoying yourself and relaxing - a course of action I cannot press upon you strongly enough - if, during this time, I should need to access your files, could you let me know your password?""""I think your password should get you anywhere in the system,"" said Fat Charlie.""Without doubt it will,"" agreed Grahame Coats, blithely. ""But just in case. You know computers, after all.""""It's mermaid,"" said Fat Charlie. ""M-E-R-M-A-I-D.""""Excellent,"" said Grahame Coats. ""Excellent."" He didn't rub his hands together, but he might as well have done.Fat Charlie walked down the stairs with a check for two thousand pounds in his pocket, wondering how he could have so misjudged Grahame Coats for the last two years.He walked around the corner to his bank, and deposited the check into his account.Then he walked down to the Embankment, to breathe, and to think.He was two thousand pounds richer. His headache of this morning had completely gone. He was feeling solid and prosperous. He wondered if he could talk Rosie into coming on a short holiday with him. It was short notice, but still-.And then he saw Spider and Rosie, walking hand in hand on the other side of the road. Rosie was finishing an ice cream. Then she stopped and dropped the remainder of the ice cream into a bin and pulled Spider toward her and, with an ice-creamy mouth, began to kiss him with enthusiasm and gusto.Fat Charlie could feel his headache coming back. He felt paralyzed.He watched them kissing. He was of the opinion that sooner or later they would have to come up for air, but they didn't, so he walked in the other direction, feeling miserable, until he reached the tube.And he went home.By the time he got home, Fat Charlie felt pretty wretched, so he got onto a bed that still smelled faintly of Daisy, and he closed his eyes.Time passed, and now Fat Charlie was walking along a sandy beach with his father. They were barefoot. He was a kid again, and his father was ageless.So, his father was saying, how are you and Spider getting on?This is a dream, pointed out Fat Charlie, and I don't want to talk about it.You boys, said his father, shaking his head. Listen. I'm going to tell you something important.What?But his father did not answer. Something on the edge of the waves had caught his eye, and he reached down and picked it up. Five pointed legs flexed languidly.Starfish, said his father, musing. When you cut one in half, they just grow into two new starfish.I thought you said you were going to tell me something important.His father clutched his chest, and he collapsed onto the sand and stopped moving. Worms came out of the sand and devoured him in moments, leaving nothing but bones.Dad?Fat Charlie woke up in his bedroom with his cheeks wet with tears. Then he stopped crying. He had nothing to be upset about. His father had not died; it had simply been a bad dream.He decided that he would invite Rosie over tomorrow night. They would have steak. He would cook. All would be well.He got up and got dressed.He was in the kitchen, twenty minutes later, spooning down a Pot Noodle, when it occurred to him that, although what had happened on the beach had been a dream, his father was still dead.Rosie stopped in at her mother's flat in Wimpole street, late that afternoon.""I saw your boyfriend today,"" said Mrs. Noah. Her given name had been Eutheria, but in the previous three decades nobody had used it to her face but her late husband, and following his death it had atrophied and was unlikely to be used again in her lifetime.""So did I,"" said Rosie. ""My god I love that man.""""Well, of course. You're marrying him, aren't you?""""Well, yes. I mean, I always knew I loved him, but today I really saw how much I loved him. Everything about him.""""Did you find out where he was last night?""""Yes. He explained it all. He was out with his brother.""""I didn't know he had a brother.""""He hadn't mentioned him before. They aren't very close.""Rosie's mother clicked her tongue. ""Must be quite a family reunion going on. Did he mention his cousin, too?""""Cousin?""""Or maybe his sister. He didn't seem entirely sure. Pretty thing, in a trashy sort of way. Looked a bit Chinese. No better than she should be, if you ask me. But that's that whole family for you.""""Mum. You haven't met his family.""""I met her. She was in his kitchen this morning, walking about that place damn near naked. Shameless. If she was his cousin.""""Fat Charlie wouldn't lie.""""He's a man isn't he?""""Mum!""""And why wasn't he at work today, anyway?""""He was. He was at work today. We had lunch together.""Rosie's mother examined her lipstick in a pocket mirror, then, with her forefinger, rubbed the scarlet smudges off her teeth.""What else did you say to him?"" asked Rosie.""We just talked about the wedding, how I didn't want his best man making one of them near-the-knuckle speeches. He looked to me like he'd been drinking. You know how I warned you about marrying a drinking man.""""Well, he looked perfectly fine when I saw him,"" said Rosie primly. Then, ""Oh Mum, I had the most wonderful day. We walked and we talked and - oh, have I told you how wonderful he smells? And he has the softest hands.""""You ask me,"" said her mother, ""he smells fishy. Tell you what, next time you see him, you ask him about this cousin of his. I'm not saying she is his cousin, and I'm not saying she's not. I'm just saying that if she is, then he has hookers and strippers and good-time girls in his family and is not the kind of person you should be seeing romantically.""Rosie felt more comfortable, now her mother was once more coming down against Fat Charlie. ""Mum. I won't hear another word.""""All right. I'll hold my tongue. It's not me that's marrying him, after all. Not me that's throwing my life away. Not me that'll be weeping into my pillow while he's out all night drinking with his fancy women. It's not me that'll be waiting, day after day, night after empty night, for him to get out of prison.""""Mum!"" Rosie tried to be indignant, but the thought of Fat Charlie in prison was too funny, too silly, and she found herself stifling a giggle.Rosie's phone trilled. She answered it, and said ""Yes,"" and ""I'd love to. That would be wonderful."" She put her phone away.""That was him,"" she said to her mother. ""I'm going over there tomorrow night. He's cooking for me. How sweet is that?"" And then she said, ""Prison indeed.""""I'm a mother,"" said her mother, in her foodless flat where the dust did not dare to settle, ""and I know what I know.""Grahame Coats sat in his office, while the day faded into dusk, staring at a computer screen. He brought up document after document, spreadsheet after spreadsheet. Some of them he changed. Most of them he deleted.He was meant to be traveling to Birmingham that evening, where a former footballer, a client of his, was to open a nightclub. Instead he called and apologized: some things were unavoidable.Soon the light outside the window was gone entirely. Grahame Coats sat in the cold glow of the computer screen, and he changed, and he overwrote, and he deleted.Here's another story they tell about Anansi.Once, long, long ago, Anansi's wife planted a field of peas. They were the finest, the fattest, the greenest peas you ever did see. It would have made your mouth water just to look at them.From the moment Anansi saw the pea field, he wanted them. And he didn't just want some of them, for Anansi was a man of enormous appetites. He did not want to share them. He wanted them all.So Anansi lay down on his bed and he sighed, long long and loud, and his wife and his sons all came a-running. ""I'm a-dying,"" said Anansi, in this little weeny- weedy- weaky voice, ""and my life is all over and done.""At this his wife and his sons began to cry hot tears.In his weensy-weak voice, Anansi says, ""On my deathbed, you have to promise me two things.""""Anything, anything,"" says his wife and his sons.""First, you got to promise me you will bury me down under the big breadfruit tree.""""The big breadfruit tree down by the pea patch, you mean?"" asks his wife.""Of course that's the one I mean,"" says Anansi. Then, in his weensy-weak voice, he says, ""And you got to promise something else. Promise me that, as a memorial to me, you going to make a little fire at the foot of my grave. And, to show you ain't forgotten me, you going to keep the little fire burning, and not ever let it go out.""""We will! We will!"" said Anansi's wife and children, wailing and sobbing.""And on that fire, as mark of your respect and your love, I want to see a lickle pot, filled with saltwater, to remind you all of the hot salt tears you shed over me as I lay dying.""""We shall! We shall!"" they wept, and Anansi, he closed his eyes, and he breathed no more.Well, they carried Anansi down to the big breadfruit tree that grew beside the pea patch, and they buried him six feet down, and at the foot of the grave they built a little fire, and they put a pot beside it, filled with saltwater.Anansi, he waits down there all the day but when night falls he climbs out of the grave, and he goes into the pea patch, where he picks him the fattest, sweetest, ripest peas. He gathers them up, and he boils them up in his pot, and he stuffs himself with them till his tummy swells and tightens like a drum.Then, before dawn, he goes back under the ground, and he goes back to sleep. He sleeps as his wife and his sons find the peas gone; he sleeps through them seeing the pot empty of water and refilling it; he sleeps through their sorrow.Each night Anansi comes out of his grave, dancing and delighting at the cleverness of him, and each night he fills the pot with peas, and he fills his tummy with peas, and he eats until he cannot eat another thing.Days go by, and Anansi's family gets thinner and thinner, for nothing ever ripens that isn't picked in the night by Anansi, and they got nothing to eat.Anansi's wife, she looks down at the empty plates, and she says to her sons, ""What would your father do?""Her sons, they think and they think, and they remember every tale that Anansi ever told them. Then they go down to the tar pits, and they buy them sixpennyworth of tar, enough to fill four big buckets, and they take that tar back to the pea patch. And down in the middle of the pea patch, they make them a man out of tar: tar face, tar eyes, tar arms, tar fingers, and tar chest. It was a fine man, as black and as proud as Anansi himself.That night, old Anansi, fat as he has ever been in his whole life, he scuttles up out of the ground, and, plump and happy, stomach swollen like a drum, he strolls over to the pea patch.""Who you?"" he says to the tar man.The tar man, he don't say one word.""This is my place,"" said Anansi to the tar man. ""It's my pea patch. You better get going, if you know what's good for you.""The tar man, he don't say one word, he don't move a muscle.""I'm the strongest, mightiest, most powerful fellow there is or was or ever will be,"" says Anansi to the tar man. ""I'm fiercer than Lion, faster than Cheetah, stronger than Elephant, more terrible than Tiger."" He swelled up with pride at his power and strength and fierceness, and he forgot he was just a little spider. ""Tremble,"" says Anansi. ""Tremble and run.""The tar man, he didn't tremble and he didn't run. Tell the truth, he just stood there.So Anansi hits him.Anansi's fist, it sticks solid.""Let go of my hand,"" he tells the tar man. ""Let go my hand, or I'm going to hit you in the face.""The tar man, he says not a word, and he doesn't move the tiniest muscle, and Anansi hits him, bash, right in the face.""Okay,"" says Anansi, ""a joke's a joke. You can keep hold of my hands if you like, but I got four more hands, and two good legs, and you can't hold them all, so you let me go and I'll take it easy on you.""The tar man, he doesn't let go of Anansi's hands, and he doesn't say a word, so Anansi hits him with all his hands and then kicks him with his feet, one after another.""Right,"" says Anansi. ""You let me go, or I bite you."" The tar fills his mouth, and covers his nose and his face.So that's how they find Anansi the next morning, when his wife and his sons come down to the pea patch by the old breadfruit tree: all stuck to the tar man, and dead as history.They weren't surprised to see him like that.Those days, you used to find Anansi like that all the time.
AB_ch6	AB	Anansi Boys	6	10107	57587	CHAPTER SIXIN WHICH FAT CHARLIE FAILS TO GET HOME, EVEN BY TAXIDaisy woke up to the alarm. She stretched in her bed like a kitten. She could hear the shower, which meant that her flatmate was already up. She put on a pink fuzzy dressing gown and went into the hall.""You want porridge?"" she called through the bathroom door.""Not much. If you're making it, I'll eat it.""""You certainly know how to make a girl feel wanted,"" said Daisy, and she went into the kitchenette and put the porridge on to cook.She went back into her bedroom, pulled on her work clothes, then looked at herself in the mirror. She made a face. She put her hair up into a tight bun at the back.Her flatmate, Carol, a thin-faced white woman from Preston, stuck her head around the bedroom door. She was toweling her hair vigorously. ""Bathroom's all yours. What's the word on the porridge?""""Probably needs a stir.""""So where were you the other night anyway? You said you were going off to Sybilla's birthday drinks, and I know you never came back.""""None of your beeswax, innit."" Daisy went into the kitchen and stirred the porridge. She added a pinch of salt and stirred it some more. She glopped the porridge into bowls and placed them on the counter.""Carol? Porridge is getting cold.""Carol came in, sat down, stared at the porridge. She was only half-dressed. ""S'not a proper breakfast, is it? You ask me, a proper breakfast is fried eggs, sausages, black pudden, and grilled tomatoes.""""You cook it,"" said Daisy, ""I'll eat it.""Carol sprinkled a dessert-spoonful of sugar on her porridge. She looked at it. Then she sprinkled another one on. ""No, you bloody won't. You say that you will. But you'll start rabbiting on about cholesterol or what fried food is doing to your kidneys."" She tasted the porridge as if it might bite her back. Daisy passed her a cup of tea. ""You and your kidneys. Actually, that might be nice for a change. You ever eaten kidneys, Daisy?""""Once,"" said Daisy. ""If you ask me, you can get the same effect by grilling half a pound of liver, then weeing all over it.""Carol sniffed. ""That wasn't called for,"" she said.""Eat your porridge.""They finished their porridge and their tea. They put the bowls in the dishwasher and, because it was not yet full, did not turn it on. Then they drove in to work. Carol, who was now in uniform, did the driving.Daisy went up to her desk, in a room filled with empty desks.The phone rang as she sat down. ""Daisy? You're late.""She looked at her watch. ""No,"" she said. ""I'm not. Sir. Now is there anything else I can do for you this morning?""""Too right. You can call a man named Coats. He's a friend of the chief super. Fellow Crystal Palace supporter. He's already texted me about it twice this morning. Who taught the chief super to text, that's what I want to know?""Daisy took down the details and called the number. She put on her most businesslike and efficient tone of voice and said, ""Detective Constable Day. How can I help you?""""Ah,"" said a man's voice. ""Well, as I was telling the chief superintendent last night, a lovely man, old friend. Good man. He suggested I talk to someone in your office. I wish to report. Well, I'm not actually certain that a crime has been committed. Probably a perfectly sensible explanation. There have been certain irregularities, and, well, to be perfectly frank with you, I've given my bookkeeper a couple of weeks' leave while I try to come to grips with the possibility that he may have been involved in certain, mm, financial irregularities.""""Suppose we get the details,"" said Daisy. ""What's your full name, sir? And the bookkeeper's name?""""My name is Grahame Coats,"" said the man on the other end of the telephone. ""Of the Grahame Coats Agency. My bookkeeper is a man named Nancy. Charles Nancy.""She wrote both names down. They did not ring any bells.Fat Charlie had planned to have an argument with spider as soon as Spider came home. He had rehearsed the argument in his head, over and over, and had won it, both fairly and decisively, every time.Spider had not, however, come home last night, and Fat Charlie had eventually fallen asleep in front of the television, half-watching a raucous game show for horny insomniacs, which seemed to be called Show Us Your Bum!He woke up on the sofa, when Spider pulled open the curtains. ""Beautiful day,"" said Spider.""You!"" said Fat Charlie. ""You were kissing Rosie. Don't try to deny it.""""I had to,"" said Spider.""What do you mean, you had to? You didn't have to.""""She thought I was you.""""Well, you knew you weren't me. You shouldn't have kissed her.""""But if I had refused to kiss her, she would have thought it was you not kissing her.""""But it wasn't me.""""She didn't know that. I was just trying to be helpful.""""Being helpful,"" said Fat Charlie, from the sofa, ""is something you do that, generally speaking, involves not kissing my fiancée. You could have said you had a toothache.""""That,"" said Spider, virtuously, ""would have been lying.""""But you were lying already! You were pretending to be me!""""Well, it would have been compounding the lie, anyway,"" explained Spider. ""Something I only did because you were in no shape to go to work. No,"" he said, ""I couldn't have lied further. I would have felt dreadful.""""Well, I did feel dreadful. I had to watch you kissing her.""""Ah,"" said Spider. ""But she thought she was kissing you.""""Don't keep saying that!""""You should feel flattered."" Spider said, ""Do you want lunch?""""Of course I don't want lunch. What time is it?""""Lunchtime,"" said Spider. ""And you're late for work again. It's a good thing I didn't cover for you again, if this is all the thanks I get.""""S'okay,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I've been given two weeks off. And a bonus.""Spider raised an eyebrow.""Look,"" said Fat Charlie, feeling like it was time to move to the second round of the argument, ""it's not like I'm trying to get rid of you or anything, but I was wondering when you were thinking of leaving?""Spider said, ""Well, when I came here, I'd only planned to visit for a day. Maybe two days. Long enough to meet my little brother, and then I'd be on my way. I'm a busy man.""""So you're leaving today.""""That was my plan,"" said Spider. ""But then I met you. I cannot believe that we have let almost an entire lifetime go by without each other's company, my brother.""""I can.""""The ties of blood,"" said Spider, ""are stronger than water.""""Water's not strong,"" objected Fat Charlie.""Stronger than vodka, then. Or volcanoes. Or, or ammonia. Look, my point is that meeting you - well, it's a privilege. We've never been part of each other's lives, but that was yesterday. Let's start a new tomorrow, today. We'll put yesterday behind us and forge new bonds - the bonds of brotherhood.""""You're totally after Rosie,"" said Fat Charlie.""Totally,"" agreed Spider. ""What do you plan to do about it?""""Do about it? Well, she's my fiancée.""""Not to worry. She thinks I'm you.""""Will you stop saying that?""Spider spread his hands in a saintly gesture, then ruined the effect by licking his lips.""So,"" said Fat Charlie, ""what are you planning to do next? Marry her, pretending to be me?""""Marry?"" Spider paused and thought for a moment. ""What. A horrible. Idea.""""Well, I was quite looking forward to it, actually.""""Spider does not marry. I'm not the marrying kind.""""So my Rosie's not good enough for you, is that what you're saying?""Spider did not answer. He walked out of the room.Fat Charlie felt like he'd scored, somehow, in the argument. He got up from the sofa, picked up the empty foil cartons that had, the previous evening, held a chicken chow mein and a crispy pork balls, and he dropped them into the bin. He went into his bedroom, where he took off the clothes he had slept in in order to put on clean clothes, discovered that, due to not doing the laundry, he had no clean clothes, so brushed yesterday's clothes down vigorously - dislodging several stray strands of chow mein - and put them back on.He went into the kitchen.Spider was sitting at the kitchen table, enjoying a steak large enough for two people.""Where did you get that from?"" said Fat Charlie, although he was certain that he already knew.""I asked you if you wanted lunch,"" said Spider, mildly.""Where did you get the steak?""""It was in the fridge.""""That,"" declaimed Fat Charlie, wagging his finger like a prosecuting attorney going in for the kill, ""that was the steak I bought for dinner tonight. For dinner tonight for me and Rosie. The dinner I was going to be cooking for her! And you're just sitting there like a, a person eating a steak, and, and eating it, and -""""It's not a problem,"" said Spider.""What do you mean, not a problem?""""Well,"" said Spider, ""I called Rosie this morning already, and I'm taking her out to dinner tonight. So you wouldn't have needed the steak anyway.""Fat Charlie opened his mouth. He closed it again. ""I want you out,"" he said.""It's a good thing for man's desire to outstrip his something or other - grasp or reach or something - or what else is Heaven for?"" said Spider, cheerfully, between mouthfuls of Fat Charlie's steak.""What the hell does that mean?""""It means I'm not going anywhere. I like it here."" He hacked off another lump of steak, shoveled it down.""Out,"" said Fat Charlie, and then the hall telephone rang. Fat Charlie sighed, walked into the hall, and answered it. ""What?""""Ah. Charles. Good to hear your voice. I know you're currently enjoying your well-earned, but do you think it might be within the bounds of possibility for you to swing by for, oh, half an hour or so, tomorrow morning? Say, around ten-ish?""""Yeah. Course,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Not a problem.""""Delighted to hear it. I'll need your signature on some papers. Well, until then.""""Who was that?"" asked Spider. He had cleaned his plate and was blotting his mouth with a paper towel.""Grahame Coats. He wants me to pop in tomorrow.""Spider said, ""He's a bastard.""""So? You're a bastard.""""Different kind of bastard. He's not good news. You should find another job.""""I love my job!"" Fat Charlie meant it when he said it. He had managed entirely to forget how much he disliked his job, and the Grahame Coats Agency, and the ghastly, lurking-behind-every-door presence of Grahame Coats.Spider stood up. ""Nice piece of steak,"" he said. ""I've set my stuff up in your spare room.""""You've what?""Fat Charlie hurried down to the end of the hall, where there was a room that technically qualified his residence as a two-bedroom flat. The room contained several cartons of books, a box containing an elderly Scalextric Racing set, a tin box filled with Hot Wheels cars (most of them missing tires), and various other battered remnants of Fat Charlie's childhood. It might have been a good-sized bedroom for a normal-sized garden gnome or an undersized dwarf, but for anyone else it was a closet with a window.Or rather, it used to be, but it wasn't. Not anymore.Fat Charlie pulled the door open and stood in the hallway, blinking.There was a room, yes; that much was still true, but it was an enormous room. A magnificent room. There were windows at the far end, huge picture windows, looking out over what appeared to be a waterfall. Beyond the waterfall, the tropical sun was low on the horizon, and it burnished everything in its golden light. There was a fireplace large enough to roast a pair of oxen, upon which three burning logs crackled and spat. There was a hammock in one corner, along with a perfectly white sofa and a four-poster bed. Near the fireplace was something that Fat Charlie, who had only ever seen them in magazines, suspected was probably some kind of Jacuzzi. There was a zebra-skin rug, and a bear pelt hanging on one wall, and there was the kind of advanced audio equipment that mostly consists of a black piece of polished plastic that you wave at. On one wall hung a flat television screen that was the width of the room that should have been there. And there was more-.""What have you done?"" asked Fat Charlie. He did not go in.""Well,"" said Spider from behind him, ""seeing as I'm going to be here for a few days, I thought I'd bring my stuff over.""""Bring your stuff? Bringing your stuff is a couple of carrier bags filled with laundry, some PlayStation games and a spider plant. This is- this is-."" He was out of words.Spider patted Fat Charlie's shoulder as he pushed past. ""If you need me,"" he said to his brother, ""I'll be in my room."" And he shut the door behind him.Fat Charlie shook the doorknob. The door was now locked.He went into the TV room, got the phone from the hall, and dialed Mrs. Higgler's number.""Who the hell is this at this time of the morning?"" she said.""It's me. Fat Charlie. I'm sorry.""""Well? What you callin' about?""""Well, I was calling to ask your advice. You see, my brother came out here.""""Your brother.""""Spider. You told me about him. You said to ask a spider if I wanted to see him, and I did, and he's here.""""Well,"" she said, noncommittally, ""that's good.""""It's not.""""Why not? He's family, isn't he?""""Look, I can't go into it now. I just want him to go away.""""Have you tried asking him nicely?""""We just got through with all that. He says he isn't going. He's set up something that looks like the pleasure dome of Kublai Khan in my box room and, I mean, round here you need the council's permission just to put in double glazing. He's got some kind of waterfall in there. Not in there, it's on the other side of the window. And he's after my fiancée.""""How do you know?""""He said so.""Mrs. Higgler said, ""I'm not at my best before I have my coffee.""""I just need to know how to make him go away.""""I don't know,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""I will talk to Mrs. Dunwiddy about it."" She hung up.Fat Charlie went back down to the end of the corridor and knocked on the door.""What is it now?""""I want to talk.""The door clicked and swung open. Fat Charlie went inside. Spider was reclining, naked, in the hot tub. He was drinking something more or less the color of electricity from a long, frosted glass. The huge picture windows were now wide open, and the roar of the waterfall contrasted with the low, liquid jazz that emanated from hidden speakers somewhere in the room.""Look,"" said Fat Charlie, ""you have to understand, this is my house.""Spider blinked. ""This?"" he asked. "" This is your house?""""Well, not exactly. But the principle's the same. I mean, we're in my spare room, and you're a guest. Um.""Spider sipped his drink and luxuriated deeper in the hot water. ""They say,"" he said, ""that houseguests are like fish. They both stink after three days.""""Good point,"" said Fat Charlie.""But it's hard,"" said Spider. ""Hard when you've gone a lifetime not seeing your brother. Hard when he didn't even know you existed. Harder still when you finally see him and learn that, as far as he's concerned, you're no better than a dead fish.""""But,"" said Fat Charlie.Spider stretched in the tub. ""I'll tell you what,"" he said. ""I can't stay here forever. Chill. I'll be gone before you know it. And, for my part, I will never think of you as a dead fish. And I appreciate that we're both under a lot of stress. So let's say no more about it. Why don't you go and get yourself some lunch - leave your front-door key behind - and then go and see a movie.""Fat Charlie put on his jacket and went outside. He put his door key down beside the sink. The fresh air was wonderful, although the day was gray and the sky was spitting drizzle. He bought a newspaper to read. He stopped at the chippie and bought a large bag of chips and a battered saveloy for his lunch. The drizzle stopped, so he sat on a bench in a churchyard and read his newspaper and ate his saveloy and chips.He very much wanted to see a film.He wandered into the Odeon, bought a ticket for the first thing showing. It was an action-adventure, and it was already on when he went inside. Things blew up. It was great.Halfway through the film it occurred to Fat Charlie that there was something that he was not remembering. It was in his head somewhere, like an itch an inch behind his eyes, and it kept distracting him.The film ended.Fat Charlie realized that, although he had enjoyed it, he had not actually managed to keep much of the film he had just seen in his head. So he bought a large bag of popcorn and sat through it again. It was even better the second time.And the third.After that, he thought that perhaps he ought to think about getting home, but there was a late-night double feature of Eraserhead and True Stories, and he had never actually seen either film, so he watched them both, although he was, by now, really quite hungry, which meant that by the end he was unsure of what Eraserhead had actually been about, or what the lady was doing in the radiator, and he wondered if they'd let him stay and watch it again, but they explained, very patiently, over and over, that they were going to close for the night, and inquired as to whether he didn't have a home to go to, and wasn't it time for him to be in bed?And of course, he did, and it was, although the fact of it had slipped his mind for a while. So he walked back to Maxwell Gardens and was slightly surprised to see that the light was on in his bedroom.The curtains were drawn as he reached the house. Still, there were silhouettes on the window, moving about. He thought he recognized both of the silhouettes.They came together; they blended into one shadow.Fat Charlie uttered one deep and terrible howl.In Mrs. Dunwiddy's house there were many plastic animals. The dust moved slowly through the air in that place, as if it were better used to the sunbeams of a more leisurely age, and could not be doing with all this fast modern light. There was a transparent plastic cover on the sofa, and chairs that crackled when you sat down on them.In Mrs. Dunwiddy's house there was pine-scented hard toilet paper - shiny, uncomfortable strips of greaseproof paper. Mrs. Dunwiddy believed in economy, and pine-scented hard toilet paper was at the bottom of her economy drive. You could still get hard toilet paper, if you looked long enough and were prepared to pay more for it.Mrs. Dunwiddy's house smelled of violet water. It was an old house. People forget that the children born to settlers in Florida were already old men and women when the dour Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. The house didn't go that far back; it had been built in the1920 s, during a Florida land development scheme, to be the show house, to represent the hypothetical houses that all the other buyers would find themselves eventually unable to build on the plots of gatory swamp they were being sold. Mrs. Dunwiddy's house had survived hurricanes without losing a roof tile.When the doorbell rang, Mrs. Dunwiddy was stuffing a small turkey. She tutted, and washed her hands, then walked down the corridor to her front door, peering out at the world through her thick, thick glasses, her left hand trailing on the wallpaper.She opened the door a crack and peered out.""Louella? It's me."" It was Callyanne Higgler.""Come in."" Mrs. Higgler followed Mrs. Dunwiddy back to the kitchen. Mrs. Dunwiddy ran her hands under the tap, then recommenced taking handfuls of soggy cornbread stuffing and pushing them deep into the turkey.""You expectin' company?""Mrs. Dunwiddy made a noncommittal noise. ""It always a good idea to be prepared,"" she said. ""Now, suppose you tell me what's going on?""""Nancy's boy. Fat Charlie.""""What about him?""""Well, I tell him about his brother, when he out here last week.""Mrs. Dunwiddy pulled her hand out of the turkey. ""That's not the end of the world,"" she said.""I tell him how he can contact his brother.""""Ahh,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy. She could disapprove with just that one syllable. ""And?""""He's turned up in Hingland. Boy's at his wit's end.""Mrs. Dunwiddy took a large handful of wet cornbread and rammed it into the turkey with a force that would have made the turkey's eyes water, if it still had any. ""Can't get him to go away?""""Nope.""Sharp eyes peered through thick lenses. Then Mrs. Dunwiddy said, ""I done it once. Can't do it again. Not that way.""""I know. But we got to do something.""Mrs. Dunwiddy sighed. ""It's true what they say. Live long enough, you see all your birds come home to roost.""""Isn't there another way?""Mrs. Dunwiddy finished stuffing the turkey. She picked up a skewer, pinned the flap of skin closed. Then she covered the bird with silver foil.""I reckon,"" she said, ""I put it on to cook late tomorrow morning. It be done in the afternoon, then I put it back into a hot oven early evening, to get it all ready for dinner.""""Who you got comin' to dinner?"" asked Mrs. Higgler.""You,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy, ""Zorah Bustamonte, Bella Noles. And Fat Charlie Nancy. By the time that boy gets here, he have a real appetite.""Mrs. Higgler said, ""He's coming here?""""Aren't you listening, girl?"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy. Only Mrs. Dunwiddy could have called Mrs. Higgler ""girl"" without sounding foolish. ""Now, help me get this turkey into the fridge.""It would be fair to say that Rosie had, that evening, just had the most wonderful night of her life: magical, perfect, utterly fine. She could not have stopped smiling, not even if she had wanted to. The food had been fabulous, and once they had eaten Fat Charlie had taken her dancing. It was a proper dance hall, with a small orchestra and people in pastel clothes who glided across the floor. She felt as if they had traveled in time together and were visiting a gentler age. Rosie had enjoyed dancing lessons from the age of five, but had no one to dance with.""I didn't know you could dance,"" she told him.""There are so many things about me you do not know,"" he said.And that made her happy. Soon enough, she and this man would be married. There were things about him she did not know? Excellent. She would have a lifetime in which to find them out. All sorts of things.She noticed the way other women, and other men, looked at Fat Charlie as she walked beside him, and she was happy she was the woman on his arm.They walked through Leicester Square, and Rosie could see the stars shining up above them, the starlight somehow crisply twinkling, despite the glare of the streetlights.For a brief moment, she found herself wondering why it had never been like this with Fat Charlie before. Sometimes, somewhere deep inside herself, Rosie had suspected that perhaps she had only kept going out with Fat Charlie because her mother disliked him so much; that she had only said yes when he had asked her to marry him because her mother would have wanted her to say no-.Fat Charlie had taken her out to the West End once. They'd gone to the theater. It was a birthday surprise for her, but there had been a mix-up on the tickets, which, it turned out, had actually been issued for the day before; the management were both understanding and extremely helpful, and they had managed to find Fat Charlie a seat behind a pillar in the stalls, while Rosie took a seat in the upper circle behind a violently giggly hen party from Norwich. It had not been a success, not as these things were counted.This evening, though, this evening had been magic. Rosie had not had many perfect moments in her life, but whatever the total was, it had just gone up by one.She loved how she felt when she was with him.And once the dancing was done, after they had stumbled out into the night, giddy on movement and champagne, then Fat Charlie - and, she thought, why did she think of him as Fat Charlie anyway? for he wasn't the least bit fat - put his arm around her and said, ""Now, you're coming back to my place,"" in a voice so deep and real it made her abdomen vibrate; and she said nothing about working the next day, nothing about there'd be time enough for that kind of thing when they were married, nothing at all, in fact, while all the time she thought about how much she didn't want the evening to end, and how very very much she wished - no, she needed - to kiss this man on the lips, and to hold him.And then, remembering she had to say something, she said yes.In the cab back to his flat, her hands held his, and she leaned against him and stared at him as the light from passing cars and streetlamps illuminated his face.""You have a pierced ear,"" she said. ""Why didn't I ever notice before that you have a pierced ear?""""Hey,"" he said with a smile, his voice a deep bass thrum, ""how do you think it makes me feel, when you've never even noticed something like that, even when we've been together for, what is it now?""""Eighteen months,"" said Rosie.""For eighteen months,"" said her fiancée.She leaned against him, breathed him in. ""I love the way you smell,"" she told him. ""Are you wearing some kind of cologne?""""That's just me,"" he told her.""Well, you should bottle it.""She paid the taxi while he opened the front door. They went up the stairs together. When they got to the top of the stairs, he seemed to be heading along the corridor, toward the spare room at the back.""You know,"" she said, ""the bedroom's here, silly. Where are you going?""""Nowhere. I knew that,"" he said. They went into Fat Charlie's bedroom. She closed the curtains. Then she just looked at him, and was happy.""Well,"" she said, after a while, ""aren't you going to try to kiss me?""""I guess I am,"" he said, and he did. Time melted and stretched and curved. She might have kissed him for a moment, or for an hour, or for a lifetime. And then -""What was that?""He said, ""I didn't hear anything.""""It sounded like someone in pain.""""Cats fighting, maybe?""""It sounded like a person.""""Could have been an urban fox. They can sound a lot like people.""She stood there with her head tipped to one side, listening intently. ""It's stopped now,"" she said. ""Hmm. You want to know the strangest thing?""""Uh-huh,"" he said, his lips now nuzzling her neck. ""Sure, tell me the strangest thing. But I've made it go away now. It won't bother you again.""""The strangest thing,"" said Rosie, ""is that it sounded like you.""Fat Charlie walked the streets, trying to clear his head. The obvious course of action was to bang on his own front door until Spider came down and let him in, then to give Spider and Rosie a piece of his mind. That was obvious. Perfectly, utterly obvious.He just needed to go back to his flat and explain the whole thing to Rosie, and shame Spider into leaving him alone. That was all he had to do. How hard could that be?Harder than it ought to be, that was for certain. He was not quite sure why he had walked away from his flat. He was even less certain how to find his way back. Streets he knew, or thought he knew, seemed to have reconfigured themselves. He found himself walking down dead ends, exploring endless cul-de-sacs, stumbling through the tangles of late-night London residential streets.Sometimes he saw the main road. There were traffic lights on it, and the lights of fast-food places. He knew that once he got onto the main road he would be able to find his way back to his house, but whenever he walked to the main road he would wind up somewhere else.Fat Charlie's feet were starting to hurt. His stomach rumbled, violently. He was angry, and as he walked he became angrier and angrier.The anger cleared his head. The cobwebs surrounding his thoughts began to evaporate; the web of streets he was walking began to simplify. He turned a corner and found himself on the main road, next to the all-night ""New Jersey Fried Chicken"" outlet. He ordered a family pack of chicken, and sat and finished it off without any help from anyone else in his family. When that was done he stood on the pavement until the friendly orange light of a For Hire sign, attached to a large black cab, came into view, and he hailed the cab. It pulled up next to him, and the window rolled down.""Where to?""""Maxwell Gardens,"" said Fat Charlie.""You taking the mickey or something?"" asked the cab driver. ""That's just around the corner.""""Will you take me there? I'll give you an extra fiver. Honest.""The cabbie breathed in loudly through his clenched teeth: it was the noise a car mechanic makes before asking you whether you're particularly attached to that engine for sentimental reasons. ""It's your funeral,"" said the cabbie. ""Hop in.""Fat Charlie hopped. The cabbie pulled out, waited for the lights to change, went around the corner.""Where did you say you wanted to go?"" asked the cabbie.""Maxwell Gardens,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Number 34. It's just past the off-license.""He was wearing yesterday's clothes, and he wished he wasn't. His mother had always told him to wear clean underwear, in case he was hit by a car, and to brush his teeth, in case they needed to identify him by his dental records.""I know where it is,"" said the cabbie. ""It's just before you get to Park Crescent.""""That's right,"" said Fat Charlie. He was falling asleep in the backseat.""I must have taken a wrong turning,"" said the cabbie. He sounded irritated. ""I'll turn off the meter, all right? Call it a fiver.""""Sure,"" said Fat Charlie, and he snuggled down in the backseat of the taxi, and he slept. The taxi drove on through the night, trying to get just around the corner.Detective Constable Day, currently on a twelve-month secondment to the Fraud Squad, arrived at the offices of the Grahame Coats Agency at 9:30A.M. Grahame Coats was waiting for her in reception, and he walked her back into his office.""Would you care for a coffee, tea?""""No, thank you. I'm fine."" She pulled out a notebook and sat looking at him expectantly.""Now, I cannot stress enough that discretion must needs be the essence of your investigations. The Grahame Coats Agency has a reputation for probity and fair dealing. At the Grahame Coats Agency, a client's money is a sacrosanct trust. I must tell you, that when I first began to entertain suspicions about Charles Nancy, I dismissed them as unworthy of a decent man and a hard worker. Had you asked me a week ago what I thought about Charles Nancy, I would have told you that he was the very salt of the earth.""""I'm sure you would. So when did you become aware that money might have been diverted from clients' accounts?""""Well, I'm still not certain. I hesitate to cast aspersions. Or first stones, for that matter. Judge not, lest ye be judged.""On television, thought Daisy, they say ""just give me the facts."" She wished she could say it, but she didn't.She did not like this man.""I've printed out all the anomalous transactions here,"" he said. ""As you'll see, they were all made from Nancy's computer. I must again stress that discretion is of the essence here: clients of the Grahame Coats Agency include a number of prominent public figures, and, as I said to your superior, I would count it as a personal favor if this matter could be dealt with as quietly as possible. Discretion must be your watchword. If, perchance, we can persuade our Master Nancy simply to return his ill-gotten gains, I would be perfectly satisfied to let the matter rest there. I have no desire to prosecute.""""I can do my best, but at the end of the day, we gather information and turn it over to the Crown Prosecution Service."" She wondered how much pull he really had with the chief super. ""So what attracted your suspicions?""""Ah yes. Frankly and in all honesty, it was certain peculiarities of behavior. The dog that failed to bark in the nighttime. The depth the parsley had sunk into the butter. We detectives find significance in the smallest things, do we not, Detective Day?""""Er, it's Detective Constable Day, really. So, if you can give me the printouts,"" she said, ""along with any other documentation, bank records all that. We may actually need to pick up his computer, to look at the hard disk.""""Absatively,"" he said. His desk phone rang, and - ""If you'll excuse me?"" - he answered it. ""He is? Good Lord. Well, tell him to just wait for me in reception. I'll come out and see him in a moment."" He put down the phone. ""That,"" he said to Daisy, ""is what I believe you would call, in police circles, a right turn-up for the books.""She raised an eyebrow.""That is the aforementioned Charles Nancy himself, here to see me. Shall we show him in? If you need to, you may use my offices as an interview room. I'm sure I even have a tape recorder you might borrow.""Daisy said, ""That won't be necessary. And the first thing I'll need to do is go through all the paperwork.""""Right-ho,"" he said. ""Silly of me. Um, would you- would you like to look at him?""""I don't see that that would accomplish anything,"" said Daisy.""Oh, I wouldn't tell him you were investigating him,"" Grahame Coats assured her. ""Otherwise he'd be off to the costa-del-crime before we could say prima facie evidence. Frankly, I like to think of myself as being extremely sympathetic to the problems of contemporary policing.""Daisy caught herself thinking that anyone who would steal money from this man could not be all bad, which was, she knew, no way for a police officer to think.""I'll lead you out,"" he said to her.In the waiting room a man was sitting. He looked as if he had slept in his clothes. He was unshaven, and he looked a little confused. Grahame Coats nudged Daisy and inclined his head toward the man. Aloud, he said, ""Charles, good Lord, man, look at the state of you. You look terrible.""Fat Charlie looked at him blearily. ""Didn't get home last night,"" he said. ""Bit of a mix-up with the taxi.""""Charles,"" said Grahame Coats, ""this is Detective Constable Day, of the Metropolitan Police. She is just here on routine business.""Fat Charlie realized there was someone else there. He focused, saw the sensible clothes that might as well have been a uniform. Then he saw the face. ""Er,"" he said.""Morning,"" said Daisy. That was what she said with her mouth. Inside her head she was going ohbollocks ohbollocks ohbollocks, over and over.""Nice to meet you,"" said Fat Charlie. Puzzled, he did something he had never done before: he imagined a plainclothes police officer with no clothes on, and found his imagination was providing him with a fairly accurate representation of the young lady beside whom he had woken up in bed, the morning after his father's wake. The sensible clothes made her look slightly older, more severe, and much scarier, but it was her, all right.Like all sentient beings, Fat Charlie had a weirdness quotient. For some days the needle had been over in the red, occasionally banging jerkily against the pin. Now the meter broke. From this moment on, he suspected, nothing would surprise him. He could no longer be outweirded. He was done.He was wrong, of course.Fat Charlie watched Daisy leave, and he followed Grahame Coats back into his office.Grahame Coats closed the door firmly. Then he perched his bottom against his desk, and smiled like a weasel who has just realized that he's been accidentally locked into the henhouse for the night.""Let us be blunt,"" he said. ""Cards on the table. No beating about the bush. Let us,"" he elaborated, ""let us call a spade a spade.""""All right,"" said Fat Charlie, ""Let's. You said you had something for me to sign?""""No longer an operative statement. Dismiss it from your mind. No, let us now discuss something you pointed out to me several days ago. You alerted me to certain unorthodox transactions occurring here.""""I did?""""Two, as they say, Charles, two can play at that game. Naturally, my first impulse was to investigate. Thus the visit this morning from Detective Constable Day. And what I found will, I suspect, not come as a shock to you.""""It won't?""""No indeed. There are, as you pointed out, definite indicators of financial irregularities, Charles. But alas, there is only one place to which the fickle finger of suspicion unerringly points.""""There is?""""There is.""Fat Charlie felt completely at sea. ""Where?""Grahame Coats attempted to look concerned, or at least to look as if he were trying to look concerned, managing an expression which, in babies, always indicates that they are need of a good burping. ""You, Charles. The police suspect you.""""Yes,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Of course they do. It's been that sort of a day.""And he went home.Spider opened the front door. It had started raining, and Fat Charlie stood there looking rumpled and wet.""So,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I'm now allowed home now, am I?""""I wouldn't do anything to stop you,"" said Spider. ""It's your home, after all. Where were you all night?""""You know perfectly well where I was. I was failing to come home. I don't know what kind of magic 'fluence you were using on me.""""It wasn't magic,"" said Spider, offended. ""It was a miracle.""Fat Charlie pushed past him and stomped up the stairs. He walked into the bathroom, put in the plug, and turned on the taps. He leaned out into the hall. ""I don't care what it's called. You're doing it in my house, and you stopped me coming home last night.""He took off the day-before-yesterday's clothes. Then he put his head back around the door. ""And the police are investigating me at work. Did you tell Grahame Coats that there were financial irregularities going on?""""Of course I did,"" said Spider.""Hah! Well, he only suspects me, that's what.""""Oh, I don't think he does,"" said Spider.""Shows all you know,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I talked to him. The police are involved. And then there's Rosie. And you and I are going to have a very long conversation about Rosie when I get out of the bath. But first of all, I'm going to get into the bath. I spent yesterday night wandering around. I got the only sleep of the night in the backseat of a taxi. By the time I woke up it was five in the morning and my taxi driver was turning into Travis Bickle. He was conducting a monologue. I told him he might as well give up looking for Maxwell Gardens, and that it obviously wasn't a Maxwell Gardens kind of night, and eventually he agreed so we went and had breakfast in one of those places taxi drivers have breakfast. Eggs and beans and sausages and toast, and tea you could stand a spoon up in. When he told the other taxi drivers he'd been driving all around last night looking for Maxwell Gardens, well, I thought blood was going to be spilled. It wasn't. But it looked a pretty close thing for a minute there.""Fat Charlie stopped to take a breath. Spider looked guilty.""After,"" said Fat Charlie. ""After my bath."" He shut the bathroom door.He climbed into the bath.He made a whimpering noise.He climbed out of the bath.He turned off the taps.He wrapped a towel around his midriff and opened the bathroom door. ""No hot water,"" he said much, much too calmly. ""Do you have any idea why we have no hot water?""Spider was still standing in the hallway. He hadn't moved. ""My hot tub,"" he said. ""Sorry.""Fat Charlie said, ""Well, at least Rosie doesn't. I mean, she wouldn't have - "" And then he caught the expression on Spider's face.Fat Charlie said, ""I want you out of here. Out of my life. Out of Rosie's life. Gone.""""I like it here,"" said Spider.""You're ruining my bloody life.""""Tough."" Spider walked down the hallway and opened the door to Fat Charlie's spare room. Golden tropical sunlight flooded the hallway momentarily, then the door was closed.Fat Charlie washed his hair in cold water. He brushed his teeth. He rummaged through his laundry hamper until he found a pair of jeans and a T-shirt that were, by virtue of being at the bottom, practically clean once more. He put them on, along with a purple sweater with a teddy bear on it his mother had once given him that he had never worn but had never got around to giving away.He went down to the end of the corridor.The boom-chagga-boom of a bass and drums penetrated the door.Fat Charlie rattled the door handle. It didn't budge. ""If you don't open this door,"" he said, ""I'm going to break it down.""The door opened without warning, and Fat Charlie lurched inward, into the empty box room at the end of the hall. The view through the window was the back of the house behind, what little you could see of it through the rain that was now lashing the windowpane.Still, from somewhere only a wall's thinness away, a stereo was playing too loudly: everything in the box room vibrated to a distant boom-chagga-boom.""Right,"" said Fat Charlie conversationally. ""You realize, of course, that this means war."" It was the traditional war cry of the rabbit when pushed too far. There are places in which people believe that Anansi was a trickster rabbit. They are wrong, of course; he was a spider. You might think the two creatures would be easy to keep separate, but they still get confused more often than you would expect.Fat Charlie went into his bedroom. He retrieved his passport from the drawer by his bed. He found his wallet where he had left it in the bathroom.He walked down to the main road, in the rain, and hailed a taxi.""Where to?""""Heathrow,"" said Fat Charlie.""Right you are,"" said the cabbie. ""Which terminal?""""No idea,"" said Fat Charlie, who knew that, really, he ought to know. It had only been a few days, after all. ""Where do they leave for Florida?""Grahame Coats had begun planning his exit from the Grahame Coats Agency back when John Major was prime minister. Nothing good lasts forever, after all. Sooner or later, as Grahame Coats himself would have delighted in assuring you, even if your goose habitually lays golden eggs, it will still be cooked. While his planning had been good - one never knew when one might need to leave at a moment's notice - and he was not unaware that events were massing, like gray clouds on the horizon, he wished to put off the moment of leaving until it could be delayed no longer.What was important, he had long ago decided, was not leaving, but vanishing, evaporating, disappearing without trace.In the concealed safe in his office - a walk-in room he was extremely proud of - on a shelf he had put up himself and had recently needed to put up again when it fell down, was a leather vanity case containing two passports, one in the name of Basil Finnegan, the other in the name of Roger Bronstein. Each of the men had been born about fifty years ago, just as Grahame Coats had, but had died in their first year of life. Both of the passport photographs in the passports were of Grahame Coats. The case also contained two wallets, each with its own set of credit cards and photographic identification in the name of one of the names of the passport holders. Each name was a signatory to the funnel accounts in the Caymans, which themselves funneled to other accounts in the British Virgin Islands, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein.Grahame Coats had been planning to leave for good on his fiftieth birthday, a little more than a year from now, and he was brooding on the matter of Fat Charlie.He did not actually expect Fat Charlie to be arrested or imprisoned, although he would not have greatly objected to either scenario had it occurred. He wanted him scared, discredited, and gone.Grahame Coats truly enjoyed milking the clients of the Grahame Coats Agency, and he was good at it. He had been pleasantly surprised to discover that, as long as he picked his clientele with care, the celebrities and performers he represented had very little sense of money and were relieved to find someone who would represent them and manage their financial affairs and make sure that they didn't have to worry. And if sometimes statements or checks were late in coming, or if they weren't always what the clients were expecting, or if there were unidentified direct debits from client accounts, well, Grahame Coats had a high staff turnover, particularly in the bookkeeping department, and there was nothing that couldn't easily be blamed on the incompetence of a previous employee or, rarely, made right with a case of champagne and a large and apologetic check.It wasn't that people liked Grahame Coats, or that they trusted him. Even the people he represented thought he was a weasel. But they believed that he was their weasel, and in that they were wrong.Grahame Coats was his own weasel.The telephone on his desk rang, and he picked it up. ""Yes?""""Mister Coats? It's Maeve Livingstone on the phone. I know you said to put her through to Fat Charlie, but he's off this week, and I wasn't sure what to say. Shall I tell her you're out?""Grahame Coats pondered. Before a sudden heart attack had carried him off, Morris Livingstone, once the best-loved short Yorkshire comedian in the country had been the star of such television series as Short Back and Sides and his own Saturday-night variety-game show Morris Livingstone, I Presume. He had even had a top-ten single back in the eighties, with the novelty song, ""It's Nice Out (But Put It Away)."" Amiable, easygoing, he had not only left all his financial affairs in the control of the Grahame Coats Agency, but he had also appointed, at Grahame Coats's suggestion, Grahame Coats himself as trustee of his estate.It would have been criminal not to give in to temptation like that.And then there was Maeve Livingstone. It would be fair to say that Maeve Livingstone had, without knowing it, featured for many years in starring and costarring roles in a number of Grahame Coats's most treasured and private fantasies.Grahame Coats said, ""Please. Put her through,"" and then, solicitously, ""Maeve, how lovely to hear from you. How are you?""""I'm not sure,"" she said.Maeve Livingstone had been a dancer when she met Morris, and had always towered over the little man. They had adored each other.""Well, why don't you tell me about it?""""I spoke to Charles a couple of days ago. I was wondering. Well, the bank manager was wondering. The money from Morris's estate. We were told we would be seeing something by now.""""Maeve,"" said Grahame Coats, in what he thought of as his dark velvet voice, the one he believed that women responded to, ""the problem is not that the money is not there - it's merely a matter of liquidity. As I've told you, Morris made a number of unwise investments toward the end of his life, and although, following my advice, he made some sound ones as well, we do need to allow the good ones to mature: we cannot pull out now without losing almost everything. But worry ye not, worry ye not. Anything for a good client. I shall write you a check from my own bank account in order to keep you solvent and comfortable. How much does the bank manager require?""""He says that he's going to have to start bouncing checks,"" she said. ""And the BBC tell me that they've been sending money from the DVD releases of the old shows. That's not invested, is it?""""That's what the BBC said? Actually, we've been chasing them for money. But I wouldn't want to put all the blame on BBC Worldwide. Our bookkeeper's pregnant, and things have been all at sixes and sevens. And Charles Nancy, who you spoke to, has been rather distraught - his father died, and he has been out of the country a great deal -""""Last time we spoke,"" she pointed out, ""you were putting in a new computer system.""""Indeed we were, and please, do not get me started on the subject of bookkeeping programs. What is it they say - to err is human, but to really, er, mess things up, you need a computer. Something like that. I shall investigate this forcefully, by hand if necessary, the old-fashioned way, and your moneys shall be wending their way to you. It's what Morris would have wanted.""""My bank manager says I need ten thousand pounds in right now, just to stop them bouncing checks.""""Ten thousand pounds shall be yours. I am writing a check for you even as we speak."" He drew a circle on his notepad, with a line going off the top of it. It looked a bit like an apple.""I'm very grateful,"" said Maeve, and Grahame Coats preened. ""I hope I'm not becoming a bother.""""You are never a bother,"" said Grahame Coats. ""No sort of bother at all.""He put down the phone. The funny thing, Grahame Coats always thought, was that Morris's comedic persona had always been that of a hardheaded Yorkshireman, proud of knowing the location of every penny.It had been a fine game, thought Grahame Coats, and he added two eyes to the apple, and a couple of ears. It now looked, he decided, more or less like a cat. Soon enough it would be time to exchange a life of milking hard-to-please celebrities for a life of sunshine, swimming pools, fine meals, good wines, and, if possible, enormous quantities of oral sex. The best things in life, Grahame Coats was convinced, could all be bought and paid for.He drew a mouth on the cat and filled it with sharp teeth, so it looked a little like a mountain lion, and as he drew he began to sing, in a reedy tenor voice;""When I were a young man my father would sayIt's lovely outside, you should go out to play,But now that I'm older, the ladies all say,""It's nice out, but put it away-""Morris Livingstone had bought and paid for Grahame Coats's penthouse flat on the Copacabana and for the installation of the swimming pool on the island of Saint Andrews, and you must not imagine that Grahame Coats was not grateful.""It's nice out, but put it awaaaay.""Spider felt odd.There was something going on: a strange feeling, spreading like a mist through his life, and it was ruining his day. He could not identify it, and he did not like it.And if there was one thing that he was definitely not feeling, it was guilty. It simply wasn't the kind of thing he ever felt. He felt excellent. Spider felt cool. He did not feel guilty. He would not have felt guilty if he was caught red-handed holding up a bank.And yet there was, all about him, a faint miasma of discomfort.Until now Spider had believed that gods were different: they had no consciences, nor did they need them. A god's relationship to the world, even a world in which he was walking, was about as emotionally connected as that of a computer gamer playing with knowledge of the overall shape of the game and armed with a complete set of cheat codes.Spider kept himself amused. That was what he did. That was the important bit. He would not have recognized guilt if he had an illustrated guide to it with all the component parts clearly labeled. It was not that he was feckless, more that he had simply not been around the day they handed out feck. But something had changed - inside him or outside, he was not sure - and it bothered him. He poured himself another drink. He waved a hand and made the music louder. He changed it from Miles Davis to James Brown. It still didn't help.He lay on the hammock, in the tropical sunshine, listening to the music, basking in how extremely cool it was to be him- and for the first time even that, somehow, wasn't enough.He climbed out of the hammock and wandered over to the door. ""Fat Charlie?""There was no answer. The flat felt empty. Outside the windows of the flat, there was a gray day, and rain. Spider liked the rain. It seemed appropriate.Shrill and sweet, the telephone rang. Spider picked it up.Rosie said, ""Is that you?""""Hullo Rosie.""""Last night,"" she said. Then she didn't say anything. Then she said, ""Was it as wonderful for you as it was for me?""""I don't know,"" said Spider. ""It was pretty wonderful for me. So, I mean, that's probably a yes.""""Mmm,"" she said.They didn't say anything.""Charlie?"" said Rosie.""Uh-huh?""""I even like not saying anything, just knowing you're on the other end of the phone.""""Me too,"" said Spider.They enjoyed the sensation of not saying anything for a while longer, savoring it, making it last.""Do you want to come over to my place tonight?"" asked Rosie. ""My flatmates are in the Cairngorms.""""That,"" said Spider, ""may be a candidate for the most beautiful phrase in the English language. My flatmates are in the Cairngorms. Perfect poetry.""She giggled. ""Twit. Um. Bring your toothbrush-?""""Oh. Oh. Okay.""And after several minutes of ""you put down the phone"" and ""no you put the down the phone"" that would have done credit to a pair of hormonally intoxicated fifteen-year-olds, the phone was eventually put down.Spider smiled like a saint. The world, given that it had Rosie in it, was the best world that any world could possibly be. The fog had lifted, the world had ungloomed.It did not even occur to Spider to wonder where Fat Charlie had gone. Why should he care about such trivia? Rosie's flat-mates were in the Cairngorms, and tonight? Why, tonight he would be bringing his toothbrush.Fat Charlie's body was on a plane to Florida; it was crushed in a seat in the middle of a row of five people, and it was fast asleep. This was a good thing: the rear toilets had malfunctioned as soon as the plane was in the air, and although the cabin attendants had hung Out of Order signs on the doors, this did nothing to alleviate the smell, which spread slowly across the back of the plane like a low-level chemical fug. There were babies crying and adults grumbling and children whining. One faction of the passengers, en route to Walt Disney World, who felt that their holidays began the moment they got on the plane, had got settled into their seats then began a sing-song. They sang ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" and ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers,"" and ""Under the Sea"" and ""Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, It's Off To Work We Go,"" and even, under the impression that it was a Disney song as well, ""We're Off to See the Wizard.""Once the plane was in the air it was discovered that, due to a catering confusion, no coach class lunch meals had been put on-board. Instead, only breakfasts had been packed, which meant there would be individual packs of cereal and a banana for all passengers, which they would have to eat with plastic knives and forks, because there were, unfortunately, no spoons, which may have been a good thing, because pretty soon there wasn't any milk for the cereal, either.It was a hell flight, and Fat Charlie was sleeping through it.In Fat Charlie's dream he was in a huge hall, and he was wearing a morning suit. Next to him was Rosie, wearing a white wedding dress, and on the other side of her on the dais was Rosie's mother, who was, a little jarringly, also wearing a wedding dress, although this one was covered with dust and with cobwebs. Far away, at the horizon, which was the distant edge of the hall, there were people firing guns and waving white flags.It's just the people at Table H, said Rosie's mother. Don't pay them no attention.Fat Charlie turned to Rosie. She smiled at him with her soft, sweet smile, then she licked her lips.Cake, said Rosie, in his dream.This was the signal for an orchestra to begin to play. It was a New Orleans jazz band, playing a funeral march.The chef's assistant was a police officer. She was holding a pair of handcuffs. The chef wheeled the cake up onto the dais.Now, said Rosie to Fat Charlie, in his dream. Cut the cake.The people at Table B - who were not people but cartoon mice and rats and barnyard animals, human-sized, and celebrating - began to sing songs from Disney cartoons. Fat Charlie knew that they wanted him to join in with them. Even asleep he could feel himself panicking at the simple idea of having to sing in public, his limbs becoming numb, his lips prickling.I can't sing with you, he told them, desperate for an excuse.I have to cut this cake.At this, the hall fell into silence. And in the silence, a chef entered, wheeling a little trolley with something on it. The chef wore Grahame Coats's face, and on the trolley was an extravagant white wedding cake, an ornate, many-tiered confection. A tiny bride and tiny groom perched precariously on the topmost tier of the cake, like two people trying to keep their balance on top of a sugar-frosted Chrysler Building.Rosie's mother reached under the table and produced a long, wooden-handled knife - almost a machete - with a rusty blade. She passed it to Rosie, who reached for Fat Charlie's right hand and placed it over her own, and together they pressed the rusty knife into the thick white icing on the topmost tier of the cake, pushed it in between the groom and the bride. The cake resisted the blade at first, and Fat Charlie pressed harder, putting all his weight on the knife. He felt the cake beginning to give. He pushed harder.The blade sliced through the topmost tier of the wedding cake. It slipped and sliced down the cake, through every layer and tier, and as it did so, the cake opened-.In his dream, Fat Charlie supposed that the cake was filled with black beads, with beads of black glass or of polished jet, and then, as they tumbled out of the cake, he realized that the beads had legs, each bead had eight clever legs, and they came out the inside of the cake like a black wave. The spiders surged forward and covered the white tablecloth; they covered Rosie's mother and Rosie herself, turning their white dresses black as ebony; then, as if controlled by some vast and malignant intelligence, they flowed, in their hundreds, toward Fat Charlie. He turned to run, but his legs were trapped in some kind of rubbery tanglefoot, and he tumbled to the floor.Now they were upon him, their tiny legs crawling over his bare skin; he tried to get up, but he was drowning in spiders.Fat Charlie wanted to scream, but his mouth was filled with spiders. They covered his eyes, and his world went dark-.Fat Charlie opened his eyes and saw nothing but blackness, and he screamed and he screamed and he screamed. Then he realized the lights were off and the window shades drawn, because people were watching the film.It was already a flight from hell. Fat Charlie had just made it a little worse for everyone else.He stood up and tried to get out to the aisle, tripping over people as he went past, then, when he was almost at the gangway, straightening up and banging the overhead locker with his forehead, which knocked open the locker door and tumbled someone's hand luggage down onto his head.People nearby, the ones who were watching, laughed. It was an elegant piece of slapstick, and it cheered them all up no end.
AB_ch7	AB	Anansi Boys	7	9645	53404	CHAPTER SEVENIN WHICH FAT CHARLIE GOES A LONG WAYThe immigration officer squinted at Fat Charlie's American passport as if she were disappointed he was not a foreign national of the kind she could simply stop coming into the country then, with a sigh, she waved him through.He wondered what he was going to do once he got through customs. Rent a car, he supposed. And eat.He got off the tram and walked through the security barrier, out into the wide shopping concourse of Orlando Airport, and was nowhere nearly as surprised as he should have been to see Mrs. Higgler standing there, scanning the faces of the arrivals, her enormous mug of coffee clutched in her hand. They saw each other at more or less the same moment, and she headed toward him.""You hungry?"" she asked him.He nodded.""Well,"" she said, ""I hope you like turkey.""Fat Charlie wondered if Mrs. Higgler's maroon station wagon was the same car he remembered her driving when he was a boy. He suspected that it was. It must have been new once, that stood to reason. Everything was new once, after all. The seats were cracked and flaking leather; the dashboard was a dusty wooden veneer.A brown paper shopping bag sat between them, on the seat.There was no cup holder in Mrs. Higgler's ancient car, and she clamped the jumbo mug of coffee between her thighs as she drove. The car appeared to predate air-conditioning, and she drove with the windows down. Fat Charlie did not mind. After the damp chill of England, the Florida heat was welcome. Mrs. Higgler headed south toward the toll road. She talked as she drove: She talked about the last hurricane, and about how she took her nephew Benjamin to SeaWorld and to Walt Disney World and how none of the tourist resorts were what they once were, about building codes, the price of gas, exactly what she had said to the doctor who had suggested a hip replacement, why tourists kept feeding 'gators, and why newcomers built houses on the beaches and were always surprised when the beach or the house went away or the 'gators ate their dogs. Fat Charlie let it all wash over him. It was just talk.Mrs. Higgler slowed down and took the ticket that would take her down the toll road. She stopped talking. She seemed to be thinking.""So,"" she said. ""You met your brother.""""You know,"" said Fat Charlie, ""you could have warned me.""""I did warn you that he is a god.""""You didn't mention that he was a complete and utter pain in the arse, though.""Mrs. Higgler sniffed. She took a swig of coffee from her mug.""Is there anywhere we can stop and get a bite to eat?"" asked Fat Charlie. ""They only had cereal and bananas on the plane. No spoons. And they ran out of milk before they got to my row. They said they were sorry and gave us all food vouchers to make up for it.""Mrs. Higgler shook her head.""I could have used my voucher to get a hamburger in the airport.""""I tell you already,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""Louella Dunwiddy been cooking you a turkey. How do you think she feels if we get there and you fill up already at McDonald's and you ain't got no appetite. Eh?""""But I'm starving. And it's over two hours away.""""Not,"" she said firmly, ""the way I drive.""And with that she put her foot down. Every now and then, as the maroon station wagon shuddered down the freeway, Fat Charlie would close his eyes tightly while at the same time pushing his own left foot down on an imaginary brake pedal. It was exhausting work.In significantly less than two hours they reached the tollway exit and got onto a local highway. They drove toward the city. They drove past the Barnes and Noble and the Office Depot. They went past the seven-figure houses with security gates. They went down the older residential streets, which Fat Charlie remembered as being much better cared-for when he was a boy. They went past the West Indian takeaway and the restaurant with the Jamaican flag in the windows, with handwritten signs pushing the oxtail and rice specials and the homemade ginger beer and the curry chicken.Fat Charlie's mouth watered; his stomach made a noise.A lurch and a bounce. Now the houses were older, and this time everything was familiar.The pink plastic flamingos were still striking attitudes in Mrs. Dunwiddy's front yard, although the sun had faded them almost white over the years. There was a mirrored gazing ball as well, and when Fat Charlie spotted it he was, only for a moment, as scared as he had ever been of anything.""How bad is it, with Spider?"" asked Mrs. Higgler, as they walked up to Mrs. Dunwiddy's front door.""Put it this way,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I think he's sleeping with my fiancée. Which is rather more than I ever did.""""Ah,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""Tch."" And she rang the doorbell.It was sort of like Macbeth, thought Fat Charlie, an hour later; in fact, if the witches in Macbeth had been four little old ladies and if, instead of stirring cauldrons and intoning dread incantations, they had just welcomed Macbeth in and fed him turkey and rice and peas spread out on white china plates on a red-and-white patterned plastic tablecloth - not to mention sweet potato pudding and spicy cabbage - and encouraged him to take second helpings, and thirds, and then, when Macbeth had declaimed that nay, he was stuffed nigh unto bursting and on his oath could truly eat no more, the witches had pressed upon him their own special island rice pudding and a large slice of Mrs. Bustamonte's famous pineapple upside-down cake, it would have been exactly like Macbeth.""So,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy, scratching a crumb of pineapple upside-down cake from the corner of her mouth, ""I understand your brother come to see you.""""Yes. I talked to a spider. I suppose it was my own fault. I never expected anything to happen.""A chorus of tuts and tsks and tchs ran around the table as Mrs. Higgler and Mrs. Dunwiddy and Mrs. Bustamonte and Miss Noles clicked their tongues and shook their heads. ""He always used to say you were the stupid one,"" said Miss Noles. ""Your father, that is. I never believed him.""""Well, how was I to know?"" Fat Charlie protested. ""It's not as if my parents ever said to me, 'By the way, Son, you have a brother you don't know about. Invite him into your life and he'll have you investigated by the police, he'll sleep with your fiancée, he'll not just move into your home but bring an entire extra house into your spare room. And he'll brainwash you and make you go to films and spend all night trying to get home and -' "" He stopped. It was the way they were looking at him.A sigh went around the table. It went from Mrs. Higgler to Miss Noles to Mrs. Bustamonte to Mrs. Dunwiddy. It was extremely unsettling and quite spooky, but Mrs. Bustamonte belched and ruined the effect.""So what do you want?"" asked Mrs. Dunwiddy. ""Say what you want.""Fat Charlie thought about what he wanted, in Mrs. Dunwiddy's little dining room. Outside, the daylight was fading into a gentle twilight.""He's made my life a misery,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I want you to make him go away. Just go away. Can you do that?""The three younger women said nothing. They simply looked at Mrs. Dunwiddy.""We can't actually make him go away,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy. ""We already-."" and she stopped herself, and said, ""Well, we done all we can about that, you see.""It is to Fat Charlie's credit that he did not, as deep down he might have wished to, burst into tears or wail or collapse in on himself like a problematic soufflé. He simply nodded. ""Well, then,"" he said. ""Sorry to have bothered you all. Thank you for the dinner.""""We can't make him go away,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy, her old brown eyes almost black behind her pebble-thick spectacles. ""But we can send you to somebody who can.""It was early evening in Florida, which meant that in London it was the dead of night. In Rosie's big bed, where Fat Charlie had never been, Spider shivered.Rosie pressed close to him, skin to skin. ""Charles,"" she said. ""Are you all right?"" She could feel the goose pimples bumping the skin of his arms.""I'm fine,"" said Spider. ""Sudden creepy feeling.""""Somebody walking over your grave,"" said Rosie.He pulled her close then, and he kissed her.And Daisy was sitting in the small common room of the house in Hendon, wearing a bright green nightdress and fluffy, vivid pink carpet slippers. She was sitting in front of a computer screen, shaking her head and clicking the mouse.""You going to be much longer?"" asked Carol. ""You know, there's a whole computer unit that's meant to be doing that. Not you.""Daisy made a noise. It was not a yes-noise and it was not a no-noise. It was an I-know-somebody-just-said-something-to-meand-if-I-make-a-noise-maybe-they'll-go-away sort of noise.Carol had heard that noise before.""Oy,"" she said. ""Big bum. Are you going to be much longer? I want to do my blog.""Daisy processed the words. Two of them sank in. ""Are you saying I've got a big bum?""""No,"" said Carol. ""I'm saying that it's getting late, and I want to do me blog. I'm going to have him shagging a supermodel in the loo of an unidentified London nightspot.""Daisy sighed. ""All right,"" she said. ""It's just fishy, that's all.""""What's fishy?""""Embezzlement. I think. Right, I've logged out. It's all yours. You know you can get into trouble for impersonating a member of the royal family.""""Bog off.""Carol blogged as a member of the British Royal Family, young, male, and out-of-control. There had been arguments in the press about whether or not she was the real thing, many of them pointing to things she wrote that could only have been known to an actual member of the British Royal Family, or to someone who read the glossy gossip magazines.Daisy got up from the computer, still pondering the financial affairs of the Grahame Coats Agency.While fast asleep in his bedroom, in a large but certainly not ostentatious house in Purley, Grahame Coats slept. If there was any justice in the world, he would have moaned and sweated in his sleep, tortured by nightmares, the furies of his conscience lashing him with scorpions. Thus it pains me to admit that Grahame Coats slept like a well-fed milk-scented baby, and he dreamed of nothing at all.Somewhere in Grahame Coats's house, a grandfather clock chimed politely, twelve times. In London, it was midnight. In Florida it was seven in the evening.Either way, it was the witching hour.Mrs. Dunwiddy removed the plasticated red-and-white check tablecloth and put it away.She said, ""Who's got the black candles?""Miss Noles said, ""I got the candles."" She had a shopping bag at her feet, and she rummaged about in it, producing four candles. They were mostly black. One of them was tall and undecorated. The other three were in the shape of a cartoon black-and-yellow penguin, with the wick coming out of his head. ""It was all they got,"" she said apologetically. ""And I had to go to three stores until I found anything.""Mrs. Dunwiddy said nothing, but she shook her head. She arranged the four candles at the four ends of the table, taking the single nonpenguin at the head of the table, where she sat. Each of the candles sat on a plastic picnic plate. Mrs. Dunwiddy took a large box of kosher salt, and she opened the spout and poured salt crystals on the table in a pile. Then she glared at the salt and pushed at it with a withered forefinger, prodding it into heaps and whorls.Miss Noles came back from the kitchen with a large glass bowl, which she placed at the center of the table. She unscrewed the top from a bottle of sherry and poured a generous helping of sherry into the bowl.""Now,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy, ""the devil grass, the St. John the Conqueror root, and the love-lies-bleeding.""Mrs. Bustamonte rummaged in her shopping bag and took out a small glass jar. ""It's mixed herbs,"" she explained. ""I thought it would be all right.""""Mixed herbs!"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy. ""Mixed herbs!""""Will that be a problem?"" said Mrs. Bustamonte. ""It's what I always use when the recipe says basil this or oregano that. I can't be doin' with it. You ask me, it's all mixed herbs.""Mrs. Dunwiddy sighed. ""Pour it in,"" she said.Half a bottle of mixed herbs was poured into the sherry. The dried leaves floated on the top of the liquid.""Now,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy, ""The four earths. I hope,"" she said, choosing her words with care, ""that no one here going to tell me that they could not get the four earths, and now we have to make do with a pebble, a dead jellyfish, a refrigerator magnet, and a bar of soap.""""I got the earths,"" said Mrs. Higgler. She produced her brown paper bag, and pulled from it four Ziploc bags each containing what looked like sand or dried clay, each of a different color. She emptied each bag at one of the four corners of the table.""Glad somebody is payin' attention,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy.Miss Noles lit the candles, pointing out as she did so how easily the penguins lit, and how cute and funny they were.Mrs. Bustamonte poured out a glass of leftover sherry for each of the four women.""Don't I get a glass?"" asked Fat Charlie, but he didn't really want one. He didn't like sherry.""No,"" said Mrs Dunwiddy, firmly, ""you don't. You'll need your wits about you."" She reached into her purse and took out a small, gold-colored pill case.Mrs. Higgler turned off the lights.They five of them sat around the table in the candlelight.""Now what?"" asked Fat Charlie. ""Shall we all join hands and contact the living?""""We do not,"" whispered Mrs. Dunwiddy. ""And I do not want to hear another word out of you.""""Sorry,"" said Fat Charlie, then wished he hadn't said it.""Listen,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy. ""You will go where they may help you. Even so, give away nothing you own, and make no promises. You understand? If you have to give somebody something, then make sure you get something of equal value in return. Yes?""Fat Charlie nearly said ""yes,"" but he caught himself in time and simply nodded.""It is good."" And with that, Mrs. Dunwiddy began to hum tunelessly, in her old old voice which quavered and faltered.Miss Noles also began to hum, rather more melodically. Her voice was higher and stronger.Mrs. Bustamonte did not hum. She hissed instead, an intermittent, snakelike hissing, which seemed to find the rhythm of the humming and weave through it and beneath it.Mrs. Higgler started up, and she did not hum, and she did not hiss. She buzzed, like a fly against a window, making a vibrating noise with her tongue and her teeth as odd and as unlikely as if she had a handful of angry bees in her mouth, buzzing against her teeth, trying to get out.Fat Charlie wondered if he should join in, but he had no idea what sort of thing he ought to do if he did, so he concentrated on sitting there and trying not to be weirded-out by all the noises.Mrs. Higgler threw a pinch of red earth into the bowl of sherry and mixed herbs. Mrs. Bustamonte threw in a pinch of the yellow earth. Miss Noles threw in the brown earth, while Mrs. Dunwiddy leaned over, painstakingly slowly, and dropped in a lump of black mud.Mrs. Dunwiddy took a sip of her sherry. Then, with arthritic fingers fumbling and pushing, she took something from the pill case and dropped it into the candle flame. For a moment the room smelled of lemons, and then it simply smelled as if something was burning.Miss Noles began to drum on the tabletop. She did not stop humming. The candle flames flickered, dancing huge shadows across the walls. Mrs. Higgler began to tap on the tabletop as well, her fingers knocking out a different beat to Miss Noles's, faster, more percussive, the two drumbeats twining to form a new rhythm.In Fat Charlie's mind all the sounds began to blend into one strange sound: the humming and the hissing and the buzzing and the drums. He was starting to feel light-headed. Everything was funny. Everything was unlikely. In the noises of the women he could hear the sound of wildlife in the forest, hear the crackling of enormous fires. His fingers felt stretched and rubbery, his feet were an immensely long way away.It seemed then that he was somewhere above them, somewhere above everything, and that beneath him there were five people around a table. Then one of the women at the table gestured and dropped something into the bowl in the middle of the table, and it flared up so brightly that Fat Charlie was momentarily blinded. He shut his eyes, which, he found, did no good at all. Even with his eyes closed, everything was much too bright for comfort.He rubbed his eyes against the daylight. He looked around.A sheer rock face skyscrapered up behind him: the side of a mountain. Ahead of him was a sheer drop: cliffs, going down. He walked to the cliff edge and, warily, looked over. He saw some white things, and he thought they were sheep until he realized that they were clouds; large, white, fluffy clouds, a very long way below him. And then, beneath the clouds, there was nothing: he could see the blue sky, and it seemed if he kept looking he could see the blackness of space, and beyond that nothing but the chill twinkling of stars.He took a step back from the cliff edge.Then he turned and walked back toward the mountains, which rose up and up, so high that he could not see the tops of them, so high that he found himself convinced that they were falling on him, that they would tumble down and bury him forever. He forced himself to look down again, to keep his eyes on the ground, and in so doing, he noticed holes in the rock face near ground level which looked like entrances to natural caves.The place between the mountainside and the cliffs, on which he was standing, was, he guessed, less than quarter of a mile wide: a boulder-strewn sandy path dotted with patches of greenery and, here and there, a dusty brown tree. The path seemed to follow the mountainside until it faded into a distant haze.Someone is watching me, thought Fat Charlie. ""Hello?"" he called, lifting his head back. ""Hello, is anybody there?""The man who stepped out of the nearest cave mouth was much darker of skin than Fat Charlie, darker even than Spider, but his long hair was a tawny yellow and it framed his face like a mane. He wore a ragged yellow lion-skin around his waist, with a lion's tail hanging down from it behind, and the tail swished a fly from his shoulders.The man blinked his golden eyes.""Who are you?"" he rumbled. ""And on whose authority do you walk in this place?""""I'm Fat Charlie Nancy,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Anansi the Spider was my father.""The massive head nodded. ""And why do you come here, Compé Anansi's child?""They were alone on the rocks, as far as Fat Charlie knew, yet it felt as if there were many people listening, many voices saying nothing, many ears twitching. Fat Charlie spoke loudly, so that anyone listening could hear. ""My brother. He is ruining my life. I don't have the power to make him leave.""""So you seek our help?"" asked the lion.""Yes.""""And this brother. He is, like you, of Anansi's blood?""""He's not like me at all,"" said Fat Charlie. ""He's one of you people.""A fluid, golden movement; the man-lion bounded down lightly, lazily, from the cave mouth, over the gray rocks, covering fifty yards in moments. Now he stood beside Fat Charlie. His tail swished impatiently.His arms folded, he looked down at Fat Charlie and said, ""Why do you not deal with this matter yourself?""Fat Charlie's mouth had dried. His throat felt extremely dusty. The creature facing him, taller than any man, did not smell like a man. The tips of his canine teeth rested on his lower lips.""Can't,"" squeaked Fat Charlie.From the mouth of the next cave along, an immense man leaned out. His skin was a brownish gray, and he had rumpled, wrinkled skin and round, round legs. ""If you and your brother quarrel,"" he said, ""then you must ask your father to judge between you. Submit to the will of the head of the family. That is the law."" He threw his head back and made a noise then, in the back of his nose and in his throat, a powerful trumpeting noise, and Fat Charlie knew he was looking at Elephant.Fat Charlie swallowed. ""My father is dead,"" he said, and now his voice was clear again, cleaner and louder than he expected. It echoed from the cliff wall, bounced back at him from a hundred cave mouths, a hundred jutting outcrops of rock. Dead dead dead dead dead, said the echo. ""That's why I came here.""Lion said, ""I have no love for Anansi the Spider. Once, long ago, he tied me to a log, and had a donkey drag me through the dust, to the seat of Mawu who made all things."" He growled at the memory, and Fat Charlie wanted to be somewhere else.""Walk on,"" said Lion. ""There may be someone here who will help you, but it is not I.""Elephant said, ""Nor I. Your father tricked me and ate my belly fat. He told me he was making me some shoes to wear, and he cooked me, and he laughed as he filled his stomach. I do not forget.""Fat Charlie walked on.In the next cave mouth along stood a man wearing a natty green suit and a sharp hat with a snakeskin band around it. He wore snakeskin boots and a snakeskin belt. He hissed as Fat Charlie came past. ""Walk on, Anansi's boy,"" Snake said, his voice a dry rattle. ""Your whole damn family nothin' but trouble. I ain't gettin' mixed up in your messes.""The woman in the next cave mouth was very beautiful, and her eyes were black oil drops, and her whiskers were snowy white against her skin. She had two rows of breasts down her chest.""I knew your father,"" she said. ""Long time back. Hoo-ee."" She shook her head in memory, and Fat Charlie felt like he had just read a private letter. She blew Fat Charlie a kiss but shook her head when he made to approach closer.He walked on. A dead tree stuck up from the ground before him like an assemblage of old gray bones. The shadows were getting longer now, as the sun was slowly descending in the endless sky, past where the cliffs cragged down into the end of the world; the eye of the sun was a monstrous gold-orange ball, and all the little white clouds beneath it were burnished with gold and with purple.The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold, thought Fat Charlie, the line of the poem surfacing from some long-forgotten English lesson. And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold. He tried to remember what a cohort was, and failed. Probably, he decided, it was some kind of chariot.Something moved, close to his elbow, and he realized that what he had thought was a brown rock, beneath the dead tree, was a man, sandy-colored, his back spotted like a leopard's. His hair was very long and very black, and when he smiled his teeth were a big cat's teeth. He only smiled briefly, and it was a smile without warmth or humor or friendship in it. He said, ""I am Tiger. Your father, he injured me in a hundred ways and he insulted me in a thousand ways. Tiger does not forget.""""I'm sorry,"" said Fat Charlie.""I'll walk along with you,"" said Tiger. ""For a short while. You say that Anansi is dead?""""Yes.""""Well. Well, well. He played me for a fool so many times. Once, everything was mine - the stories, the stars, everything. He stole it all away from me. Maybe now he is dead people will stop telling those damn stories of his. Laughing at me.""""I'm sure they will,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I've never laughed at you.""Eyes the color of polished emeralds flashed in the man's face. ""Blood is blood,"" was all he said. ""Anansi's bloodline is Anansi.""""I am not my father,"" said Fat Charlie.Tiger bared his teeth. They were very sharp. ""You don't go around making people laugh at things,"" explained Tiger. ""It's a big, serious world out there; nothing to laugh about. Not ever. You must teach the children to fear, teach them to tremble. Teach them to be cruel. Teach them to be the danger in the dark. Hide in the shadows, then pounce or spring or leap or drop, and always kill. You know what the true meaning of life is?""""Um,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Is it love one another?""""The meaning of life is the hot blood of your prey on your tongue, the meat that rends beneath your teeth, the corpse of your enemy left in the sun for the carrion eaters to finish. That is what life is. I am Tiger, and I am stronger than Anansi ever was, bigger, more dangerous, more powerful, crueler, wiser-.""Fat Charlie did not want to be in that place, talking to Tiger. It was not that Tiger was mad; it was that he was so earnest in his convictions, and all his convictions were uniformly unpleasant. Also, he reminded Fat Charlie of someone, and while he could not have told you who, he knew it was someone he disliked. ""Will you help me get rid of my brother?""Tiger coughed, as if he had a feather, or perhaps a whole blackbird, stuck in his throat.""Would you like me to get you some water?"" asked Fat Charlie.Tiger eyed Fat Charlie with suspicion. ""Last time Anansi offered me water, I wound up trying to eat the moon out of a pond, and I drowned.""""I was just trying to help.""""That was what he said."" Tiger leaned in to Fat Charlie, stared him in the eye. Close-up, he did not look even faintly human - his nose was too flat, his eyes were positioned differently, and he smelled like a cage at the zoo. His voice was a rumbling growl. ""This is how you help me, Anansi's child. You and all your blood. You keep well away from me. Understand? If you want to keep the meat on those bones."" He licked his lips then, with a tongue the red of fresh-killed flesh and longer than any human tongue had ever been.Fat Charlie backed away, certain that if he turned, if he ran, he would feel Tiger's teeth in his neck. There was nothing remotely human about the creature now: it was the size of a real tiger. It was every big cat that had turned man-eater, every tiger that had broken a human's neck like a house cat dispatching a mouse. So he stared at Tiger as he edged backward, and soon enough the creature padded back to its dead tree and stretched out on the rocks and vanished into the patchy shadows, only the impatient swish of its tail betraying its position.""Don't you worry yourself about him,"" said a woman, from a cave mouth. ""Come here.""Fat Charlie could not decide if she was attractive or monstrously ugly. He walked toward her.""He come on all high-and-so-mighty, but he's a-scairt of his own shadow. And he's scairter of your daddy's shadow. He got no strength in his jaws.""There was something doglike about her face. No, not doglike-.""Now, me,"" she continued, as he reached her, ""me, I crush the bone. That's where the good stuff is hid. That's where the sweetest meats are hid, and nobody knows it but me.""""I'm looking for someone to help me get rid of my brother.""The woman threw back her head and laughed, a wild bray of a laugh, loud, long and insane, and Fat Charlie knew her then.""You won't find anyone here to help you,"" she said. ""They all suffered, when they went up against your father. Tiger hates you and your kind more than anyone has ever hated anything, but even he won't do anything while your father's out there in the world. Listen: Walk this path. You ask me, and I got a stone of prophecy behind my eye, you won't find nobody to help you till you find an empty cave. Go in. Talk to whoever you find there. Understand me?""""I think I do.""She laughed. It was not a good laugh. ""You want to stop with me for a while first? I'm an education. You know what they say - nothing leaner, meaner, or obscener than Hyena.""Fat Charlie shook his head and kept walking, past the caves that line the rocky walls at the end of the world. As he passed the darkness of each cave, he would glance inside. There were people of all shapes and all sizes, tiny people and tall people, men and women. And as he passed, and as they moved in and out of the shadows, he would see flanks or scales, horns or claws.Sometimes he scared them as he passed, and they would retreat into the back of the cave. Others would come forward, staring aggressively or curiously.Something tumbled through the air from the rocks above a cave mouth and landed beside Fat Charlie. ""Hello,"" it said breathlessly.""Hello,"" said Fat Charlie.The new one was excitable and hairy. Its arms and legs seemed all wrong. Fat Charlie tried to place it. The other animal-people were animals, yes, and people, too, and there was nothing strange or contradictory about this - the animalness and the humanness combined like the stripes on a zebra to make something other. This one, however, seemed both human and almost human, and the oddness of it made Fat Charlie's teeth hurt. Then he got it.""Monkey,"" he said. ""You're Monkey.""""Got a peach?"" said Monkey. ""Got a mango? Got a fig?"""" 'Fraid not,"" said Fat Charlie.""Give me something to eat,"" said Monkey. ""I'll be your friend.""Mrs. Dunwiddy had warned him about this. Give nothing away, he thought. Make no promises.""I'm not giving you anything, I'm afraid.""""Who are you?"" asked Monkey. ""What are you? You seem like half a thing. Are you from here or from there?""""Anansi was my father,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I'm looking for someone to help me deal with my brother, to make him go away.""""Might get Anansi mad,"" said Monkey. ""Very bad idea that. Get Anansi mad, you never in any more stories.""""Anansi's dead,"" said Fat Charlie.""Dead there,"" said Monkey. ""Maybe. But dead here? That's another stump of grubs entirely.""""You mean, he could be here?"" Fat Charlie looked up at the mountainside more warily: the idea that he might, in one of the cave mouths, find his father creaking back and forward in a rocking chair, green fedora hat pushed back on his head, sipping from a can of brown ale and stifling a yawn with his lemon yellow gloves, was troubling indeed.""Who? What?""""Do you think he's here?""""Who?""""My father.""""Your father?""""Anansi.""Monkey leapt to the top of a rock in terror, then he pressed himself against the rock, his gaze flicking from side to side as if keeping an eye out for sudden tornadoes. ""Anansi? He's here?""""I was asking you that,"" said Fat Charlie.Monkey swung suddenly, so he was hanging upside down from its feet, his upside-down face staring straight into Fat Charlie's. ""I go back to the world sometimes,"" he said. ""They say, Monkey, wise Monkey, come, come. Come eat the peaches we have for you. And the nuts. And the grubs. And the figs.""""Is my father here?"" asked Fat Charlie, patiently.""He doesn't have a cave,"" said Monkey. ""I would know if he had a cave. I think. Maybe he had a cave and I forgot. If you gave me a peach, I would remember better.""""I don't have anything on me,"" said Fat Charlie.""No peaches?""""Nothing, I'm afraid.""Monkey swung himself up to the top of his rock, and he was gone.Fat Charlie continued along the rocky path. The sun had sunk until it was level with the path, and it burned a deep orange. It shone its old light straight into the caves, and showed each cave to be inhabited. That must be Rhinoceros, gray of skin, staring out shortsightedly; there, the color of a rotten log in shallow water, was Crocodile, his eyes as black as glass.There was a rattle behind him of stone scuttering against stone, and Fat Charlie turned with a jerk. Monkey stared up at him, his knuckles brushing the path.""I really haven't got any fruit,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Or I'd give you some.""Monkey said, ""Felt sorry for you. Maybe you should go home. This is a bad bad bad bad bad idea. Yes?""""No,"" said Fat Charlie.""Ah,"" said Monkey. ""Right. Right right right right right."" He stopped moving, then a sudden burst of loping speed, and he bounded past Fat Charlie and stopped in front of a cave some little distance away.""Not to go in there,"" he called. ""Bad place."" He pointed to the cave opening.""Why not?"" asked Fat Charlie. ""Who's in there?""""Nobody's in there,"" said Monkey, triumphantly. ""So it's not the one you want, is it?""""Yes,"" said Fat Charlie. ""It is.""Monkey chittered and bounced, but Fat Charlie walked past him and clambered up the rocks until he reached the mouth of the empty cave, as the crimson sun fell below the cliffs at the end of the world.Walking the path along the edge of the mountains at the beginning of the world (it's only the mountains at the end of the world if you're coming from the other direction), reality seemed strange and strained. These mountains and their caves are made from the stuff of the oldest stories (this was long before human-people, of course; whatever made you imagine that people were the first things to tell stories?), and stepping off the path into the cave, Fat Charlie felt as if he were walking into someone else's reality entirely. The cave was deep; its floor was splashed white with bird droppings. There were feathers on the cave floor too, and here and there, like a desiccated and abandoned feather duster, was the corpse of a bird, flattened and dried.At the back of the cave, nothing but darkness.Fat Charlie called ""Hello?"" and the echo of his voice came back to him from the interior of the cave. Hello hello hello hello. He kept walking. Now the darkness in the cave seemed almost palpable, as if something thin and dark had been laid over his eyes. He walked slowly, a step at a time, his arms outstretched.Something moved.""Hello?""His eyes were learning to use what little light there was, and he could make something out. It's nothing. Rags and feathers, that's all. Another step, and the wind stirred the feathers and flapped the rags on the floor of the cave.Something fluttered about him, fluttered through him, beating the air with the clatter of a pigeon's wings.Swirling. Dust stung his eyes and his face, and he blinked in the cold wind and took a step back as it rose up before him, a storm of dust and rags and feathers. Then the wind was gone, and where the feathers had been blowing was a human figure, which reached out a hand and beckoned to Fat Charlie.He would have stepped back, but it reached out and took him by the sleeve. Its touch was light and dry, and it pulled him toward it-.He took one step forward into the cave --and was standing in the open air, on a treeless, copper-colored plain, beneath a sky the color of sour milk.Different creatures have different eyes. Human eyes (unlike, say, a cat's eyes, or an octopus's) are only made to see one version of reality at a time. Fat Charlie saw one thing with his eyes, and he saw something else with his mind, and in the gulf between the two things, madness waited. He could feel a wild panic welling up inside him, and he took a deep breath and held it in while his heart thudded against his rib cage. He forced himself to believe his eyes, not his mind.So while he knew that he was seeing a bird, mad-eyed, ragged-feathered, bigger than any eagle, taller than an ostrich, its beak the cruel tearing weapon of a raptor, its feathers the color of slate overlaid with an oilslick sheen, making a dark rainbow of purples and greens, he really only knew that for an instant, somewhere in the very back of his mind. What he saw with his eyes was a woman with raven-black hair, standing where the idea of a bird had been. She was neither young nor old, and she stared at him with a face that might have been carved from obsidian in ancient times, when the world was young.She watched him, and she did not move. Clouds roiled across the sour milk sky.""I'm Charlie,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Charlie Nancy. Some people, well, most people, call me Fat Charlie. You can, too. If you like.""No response.""Anansi was my father.""Still nothing. Not a quiver; not a breath.""I want you to help me make my brother go away.""She tilted her head at this. Enough to show that she was listening, enough to show that she was alive.""I can't do it on my own. He's got magic powers and stuff. I spoke to a spider, and the next thing you know, my brother turns up. Now I can't make him go away.""Her voice, when she spoke, was as rough and as deep as a crow's. ""What do you wish me to do about it?""""Help me?"" he suggested.She appeared to be thinking.Later, Fat Charlie tried and failed to remember what she had been wearing. Sometimes he thought it must have been a cloak of feathers; at other times he believed it must have been rags of some kind, or perhaps a tattered raincoat, of the kind she wore when he saw her in Piccadilly, later, when it had all started to go bad. She was not naked, though: of that he was nearly certain. He would have remembered if she had been naked, wouldn't he?""Help you,"" she echoed.""Help me get rid of him.""She nodded. ""You wish me to help you get rid of Anansi's bloodline.""""I just want him to go away and leave me alone. I don't want you to hurt him or anything.""""Then promise me Anansi's bloodline for my own.""Fat Charlie stood on the vast coppery plain, which was somehow, he knew, inside the cave in the mountains at the end of the world and was, in its turn, in some sense, inside Mrs. Dunwiddy's violet-scented front room, and he tried to make sense of what she was asking for.""I can't give things away. And I can't make promises.""""You want him to go,"" she said. ""Say it. My time is precious."" She folded her arms and stared at him with mad eyes. ""I am not scared of Anansi.""He remembered Mrs. Dunwiddy's voice. ""Um,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I mustn't make promises. And I have to ask for something of equal value. I mean, it has to be a trade.""The Bird Woman looked displeased, but she nodded. ""Then I shall give you something of equal value in trade. I give my word."" She put her hand over his hand, as if she was giving him something, then squeezed his hand closed. ""Now say it.""""I give you Anansi's bloodline,"" Fat Charlie said.""It is good,"" said a voice, and at that she went, quite literally, to pieces.Where a woman had been standing, there was now a flock of birds, which were flying, as if startled by a gunshot, all in different directions. Now the sky filled with birds, more birds than Fat Charlie had ever imagined, brown birds and black, wheeling and crossing and flowing like a cloud of black smoke vaster than the mind could hold, like a cloud of midges as big as the world.""You'll make him go away, now?"" called Fat Charlie, shouting the words into the darkening milky sky. The birds slipped and slid in the sky. Each moved only a fraction, and they kept flying, but suddenly Fat Charlie was staring up at a face in the sky, a face made of swirling birds. It was very big.It said his name in the screams and caws and calls of a thousand, thousand, thousand birds, and lips the size of tower blocks formed the words in the sky.Then the face dissolved into madness and chaos as the birds that made it flew down from that pale sky, flew straight toward him. He covered his face with his hands, trying to protect himself.The pain in his cheek was harsh and sudden. For an instant he believed that one of the birds must have gashed him, torn at his cheek with its beak or talons. Then he saw where he was.""Don't hit me again!"" he said. ""It's all right. You don't have to hit me!""On the table, the penguins were guttering low; their heads and shoulders were gone, and now the flames were burning in the shapeless black-and-white blobs that had once been their bellies, their feet in frozen pools of blackish candle wax. There were three old women staring at him.Miss Noles threw the contents of a glass of water into his face.""You didn't have to do that either,"" he said. ""I'm here, aren't I?""Mrs. Dunwiddy came into the room. She was holding a small brown glass bottle triumphantly. ""Smelling salts,"" she announced. ""I know I got some somewhere. I buy these in, oh, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. I don't know if they still any good."" She peered at Fat Charlie, then scowled. ""He wake up. Who did wake him up?""""He wasn't breathing,"" said Mrs. Bustamonte. ""So I give him a slap.""""And I pour water on him,"" said Miss Noles, ""which help bring him around the rest of the way.""""I don't need smelling salts,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I'm already wet and in pain."" But, with elderly hands, Mrs. Dunwiddy had removed the cap from the bottle, and she was pushing it under his nose. He breathed in as he moved back, and inhaled a wave of ammonia. His eyes watered, and he felt as if he had been punched in the nose. Water dripped down his face.""There,"" said Mrs. Dunwiddy. ""Feeling better now?""""What time is it?"" asked Fat Charlie.""It's almost five in the morning,"" said Mrs. Higgler. She took a swig of coffee from her gigantic mug. ""We all worried about you. You better tell us what happened.""Fat Charlie tried to remember. It was not that it had evaporated, as dreams do, more as if the experience of the last few hours had happened to somebody else, someone who was not him, and he had to contact that person by some hitherto unpracticed form of telepathy. It was all a jumble in his mind, the technicolor Ozness of the other place dissolving back into the sepia tones of reality. ""There were caves. I asked for help. There were lots of animals there. Animals who were people. None of them wanted to help. They were all scared of my daddy. Then one of them said she would help me.""""She?"" said Mrs. Bustamonte.""Some of them were men, and some of them were women,"" said Fat Charlie. ""This one was a woman.""""Do you know what she was? Crocodile? Hyena? Mouse?""He shrugged. ""I might have remembered before people started hitting me and pouring water on me. And putting things in my nose. It drives stuff out of your head.""Mrs. Dunwiddy said, ""Do you remember what I tell you? Not giving anything away? Only trade?""""Yes,"" he said, vaguely proud of himself. ""Yes. There was a monkey who wanted me to give him things, and I said no. Look, I think I need a drink.""Mrs. Bustamonte took a glass of something from the table. ""We thought maybe you need a drink. So we put the sherry through the strainer. There may be a few mixed herbs in there, but nothin' big.""His hands were fists in his lap. He opened his right hand to take the glass from the old woman. Then he stopped, and he stared.""What?"" asked Mrs. Dunwiddy. ""What is it?""In the palm of his hand, black and crushed out of shape, and wet with sweat, Fat Charlie was holding a feather. He remembered, then. He remembered all of it.""It was the Bird Woman,"" he said.Gray dawn was breaking as Fat Charlie climbed into the passenger seat of Mrs. Higgler's station wagon.""You sleepy?"" she asked him.""Not really. I just feel weird.""""Where do you want me to take you? My place? Your dad's house? A motel?""""I don't know.""She put the car into gear and lurched out into the road.""Where are we going?""She did not answer. She slurped some coffee from her megamug. Then she said, ""Maybe what we do tonight is for the best and maybe it ain't. Sometimes family things, they best left for families to fix. You and your brother. You're too similar. I guess that is why you fight.""""I take it this is some obscure West Indian usage of the word 'similar' which means 'nothing at all alike'?""""Don't you start going all British on me. I know what I'm sayin'. You and him, you both cut from the same cloth. I remember your father sayin' to me, Callyanne, my boys, they stupider than - you know, it don't matter what he actually said, but the point is, he said it about both of you."" A thought struck her. ""Hey. When you go to the place where the old gods are, you see your father in that place?""""I don't think so. I'd remember.""She nodded, and said nothing as she drove.She parked the car, and they got out.It was chilly in the Florida dawn. The Garden of Rest looked like something from a movie: there was a low ground mist which threw everything into soft focus. Mrs. Higgler opened the small gate, and they walked through the cemetery.Where there had been only fresh earth filling his father's grave, now there was turf, and at the head of the grave was a metal plaque with a metal vase built into it, and in the vase a single yellow silk rose.""Lord have mercy on the sinner in this grave,"" said Mrs Higgler, with feeling. ""Amen, amen, amen.""They had an audience: the two red-headed cranes which Fat Charlie had observed on his previous visit strutted toward them, heads bobbing, like two aristocratic prison visitors.""Shoo!"" said Mrs. Higgler. The birds started at her, incuriously, and did not leave.One of them ducked its head down into the grass, came up again with a lizard struggling in its beak. A gulp and a shake, and the lizard was a bulge in the bird's neck.The dawn chorus was beginning: grackles and orioles and mockingbirds were singing in the day in the wilderness beyond the Garden of Rest. ""It'll be good to be home again,"" said Fat Charlie. ""With any luck she'll have made him leave by the time I get there. Then everything will be all right. I can sort everything out with Rosie."" A mood of gentle optimism welled up within him. It was going to be a good day.In the old stories, Anansi lives just like you do or I do, in his house. He is greedy, of course, and lustful, and tricky, and full of lies. And he is good-hearted, and lucky, and sometimes even honest. Sometimes he is good, sometimes he is bad. He is never evil. Mostly, you are on Anansi's side. This is because Anansi owns all the stories. Mawu gave him the stories, back in the dawn days, took them from Tiger and gave them to Anansi, and he spins the web of them so beautifully.In the stories, Anansi is a spider, but he is also a man. It is not hard to keep two things in your head at the same time. Even a child could do it.Anansi's stories are told by grandmothers and by aunts in the West Coast of Africa and across the Caribbean, and all over the world. The stories have made it into books for children: big old smiling Anansi playing his merry tricks upon the world. Trouble is, grandmothers and aunts and writers of books for children tend to leave things out. There are stories that aren't appropriate for little children anymore.This is a story you won't find in the nursery tales. I call it,

ANANSI AND BIRDAnansi did not like Bird, because when Bird was hungry she ate many things, and one of the things that Bird ate was spiders, and Bird, she was always hungry.They used to be friends, but they were friends no longer.One day Anansi was walking, and he saw a hole in the ground, and that gave him an idea. He puts wood in the bottom of the hole, and he makes a fire, and he puts a cookpot in the hole and drops in roots and herbs. Then he starts running around the pot, running and dancing and calling and shouting, going, I feel good. I feel soooo good. Oh boy, all my aches and pains be gone and I never felt so good in my whole damn life!Bird hears the commotion. Bird flies down from the skies to see what all the fuss is about. She goes, What you singing about? Why you carrying on like a madman, Anansi?Anansi sings, I had a pain in my neck, but now it's gone. I had a pain in my belly, but not any longer. I had creaks in my joints, but now I'm supple as a young palm tree, I'm smooth as Snake the morning after he sheds his skin. I'm powerful happy, and now I shall be perfect, for I know the secret, and nobody else does.What secret? asks Bird.My secret, says Anansi. Everyone going to give me their favorite things, their most precious things, just to learn my secret. Whoo! Whee! I do feel good!Bird hops a little closer, and she puts her head on one side. Then she asks, Can I learn your secret?Anansi looks at Bird with suspicion on his face, and he moves to stand in front of the pot in the hole, bubbling away.I don't think so, Anansi says. May not be enough to go around. Don't bother yourself about it.Bird says, Now Anansi, I know we haven't always been friends. But I'll tell you what. You share your secret with me, and I promise you no bird will never eat no spider ever again. We'll be friends until the end of time.Anansi scratches his chin, and he shakes his head. It's a mighty big secret, he says, making people young and spry and lusty and free from all pain.Bird, she preens. Bird she says, Oh, Anansi, I'm sure you know that I have always found you a particularly handsome figure of a man. Why don't we lie by the side of the road for a little while, and I'm sure I can make you forget all your reservations about telling me your secret.So they lie by the side of the road, and they get to canoodling and laughing and getting all silly, and once Anansi has had what he wants Bird says, Now Anansi, what about your secret?Anansi says, Well, I wasn't going to tell anyone. But I'll tell you. It's an herbal bath, in this hole in the ground. Watch, I'll drop in these leaves and these roots. Now, anyone who goes into the bath they going to live forever, feeling no pain. I had the bath, and now I'm frisky as a young goat. But I don't think I should let anyone else use the bath.Bird, she looks down at the bubbling water, and quick as anything she slips down into the pot.It's awful hot, Anansi, she says.It's got to be hot for the herbs to do their good things, says Anansi. Then he takes the lid of the pot and he covers the pot with it. It's a heavy lid, and Anansi, he puts a rock on top of it, to weigh it down more.Bam! Bem! Bom! comes the knocking from inside the cookpot.If I let you out now, calls Anansi, all the good work of the bubbling bath will be undone. You just relax in there and feel yourself getting healthier.But maybe Bird did not hear him or believe him, because the knocking and the pushing kept on coming from inside the pot for a while longer. And then it stopped.That evening Anansi and his family had the most delicious Bird soup, with boiled Bird. They did not go hungry again for many days.Since that time, birds eat spiders every chance they get, and spiders and birds aren't never going to be friends.There's another version of the story where they talk Anansi into the cookpot, too. The stories are all Anansi's, but he doesn't always come out ahead.

AB_ch8	AB	Anansi Boys	8	5933	33568	CHAPTER EIGHTIN WHICH A POT OF COFFEE COMES IN PARTICULARLY USEFULIf anything was making Spider go away, Spider didn't know about it. On the contrary, Spider was having an excellent time being Fat Charlie. He was having such a good time being Fat Charlie he began to wonder why he hadn't been Fat Charlie before. It was more fun than a barrelful of monkeys.The bit of being Fat Charlie that Spider liked best was Rosie.Until now Spider had regarded women as more or less interchangeable. You didn't give them a real name, or an address that would work for longer than a week, of course, or anything more than a disposable cell-phone number. Women were fun, and decorative, and terrific accessories, but there would always be more of them; like bowls of goulash coming along a conveyor belt, when you were done with one, you simply picked up the next, and spooned in your sour cream.But Rosie-Rosie was different.He couldn't have told you how she was different. He had tried and failed. Partly it was how he felt when he was with her: as if, seeing himself in her eyes, he became a wholly better person. That was part of it.Spider liked knowing that Rosie knew where to find him. It made him feel comfortable. He delighted in the pillowy curves of her, the way she meant nothing but good to the world, the way she smiled. There was really nothing at all wrong with Rosie, apart from having to spend time away from her, and, of course, he was beginning to discover, the little matter of Rosie's mother. On this particular evening, while Fat Charlie was in an airport four thousand miles away in the process of being bumped up to first class, Spider was in Rosie's mother's flat in Wimpole Street, and he was learning about her the hard way.Spider was used to being able to push reality around a little, just a little but that was always enough. You just had to show reality who was boss, that was all. Having said that, he had never met anyone who inhabited her own reality quite so firmly as Rosie's mother.""Who's this?"" she asked, suspiciously, as they walked in.""I'm Fat Charlie Nancy,"" said Spider.""Why is he saying that?"" asked Rosie's mother. ""Who is he?""""I'm Fat Charlie Nancy, your future son-in-law, and you really like me,"" said Spider, with utter conviction.Rosie's mother swayed and blinked and stared at him. ""You may be Fat Charlie,"" she said, uncertainly, ""but I don't like you.""""Well,"" said Spider, ""you should. I am remarkably likeable. Few people have ever been as likeable as I am. There is, frankly, no end to my likeability. People gather together in public assemblies to discuss how much they like me. I have several awards, and a medal from a small country in South America which pays tribute both to how much I am liked and my general all-around wonderfulness. I don't have it on me, of course. I keep my medals in my sock drawer.""Rosie's mother sniffed. She did not know what was going on, but whatever it was, she did not like it. Until now, she felt that she had got the measure of Fat Charlie. She might, she admitted to herself, have mishandled things a little in the beginning: it was quite possible that Rosie would not have attached herself to Fat Charlie with such enthusiasm if, following the first meeting of her mother and Fat Charlie, her mother had not expressed her opinion quite so vociferously. He was a loser, Rosie's mother had said, for she could smell fear like a shark scenting blood across the bay. But she had failed to persuade Rosie to dump him, and now her main strategy involved assuming control of the wedding plans, making Fat Charlie as miserable as possible, and contemplating the national divorce statistics with a certain grim satisfaction.Something different was now happening, and she did not like it. Fat Charlie was no longer a large vulnerable person. This new, sharp creature confused her.Spider, for his part, was having to work.Most people do not notice other people. Rosie's mother did. She noticed everything. Now she sipped her hot water from a bone china cup. She knew that she had just lost a skirmish, even if she could not have told you how or what the battle was about. So she moved her next assault to higher ground.""Charles, dear,"" she said, ""tell me about your cousin Daisy. I worry that your family is underrepresented. Would you like her to be given a larger role in the wedding party?""""Who?""""Daisy,"" said Rosie's mother, sweetly. ""The young lady I met at your house the other morning, wandering around in her scanties. If she was your cousin, of course.""""Mother! If Charlie says she was his cousin-.""""Let him talk for himself, Rosie,"" said her mother, and she took another sip of hot water.""Right,"" said Spider. ""Daisy,"" said Spider.He cast his mind back to the night of wine, women and song: he had brought the prettiest and funniest of the women back to the flat with them, after telling her that it was her idea, and then had needed her help in getting the semiconscious bulk of Fat Charlie up the stairs. Having already enjoyed the attentions of several of the other women during the course of the evening, he had brought the little funny one back with him rather as one might set aside an after-dinner mint, but he had found, on getting home and putting a cleaned-up Fat Charlie to bed, that he was no longer hungry. That one.""Sweet little cousin Daisy,"" he continued, without a pause. ""I am certain that she would love to be involved in the wedding, should she be in the country. Alas, she's a courier. Always traveling. One day she's here, the next, she's dropping off a confidential document in Murmansk.""""You don't have her address? Or her phone number?""""We can look for her together, you and I,"" agreed Spider. ""Zooming around the world. She comes, she goes.""""Then,"" said Rosie's mother, much as Alexander the Great might have ordered the sacking and pillaging of a little Persian village, ""the next time she is in the country, you must invite her over. I thought she was such a pretty little thing, and I am sure that Rosie would just love to meet her.""""Yes,"" said Spider. ""I must. I really must.""Each person whoever was or is or will be has a song. It isn't a song that anybody else wrote. It has its own melody, it has its own words. Very few people get to sing their own song. Most of us fear that we cannot do it justice with our voices, or that our words are too foolish or too honest, or too odd. So people live their songs instead.Take Daisy, for example. Her song, which had been somewhere in the back of her head for most of her life, had a reassuring, marching sort of beat, and words that were about protecting the weak, and it had a chorus that began ""Evildoers beware!"" and was thus much too silly ever to be sung out loud. She would hum it to herself sometimes though, in the shower, during the soapy bits.And that is, more or less, everything you need to know about Daisy. The rest is details.Daisy's father was born in Hong Kong. Her mother came from Ethiopia, of a family of wealthy carpet exporters: they owned a house in Addis Ababa, and another house and lands outside Nazret. Daisy's parents met at Cambridge - he was studying computing before that was something that was seen as being a sensible career path, and she was devouring molecular chemistry and international law. They were two young people who were equally studious, naturally shy, and generally ill-at-ease. They were both homesick, but for very different things; however, they both played chess, and they met on a Wednesday afternoon, at the chess club. They were, as novices, encouraged to play together, and during their first game Daisy's mother beat Daisy's father with ease.Daisy's father was nettled by this, enough that he shyly asked for a rematch on the following Wednesday, and on every successive Wednesday after that (excluding vacations and public holidays) for the next two years.Their social interaction increased as their social skills and her spoken English improved. Together, they held hands as part of a human chain and protested the arrival of large trucks loaded with missiles. Together, although as part of a much larger party, they traveled to Barcelona in order to protest the unstoppable flood of international capitalism and to register stern protests at corporate hegemonies. This was also the time they got to experience officially squirted tear gas, and Mr. Day's wrist was sprained as he was being pushed out of the way by the Spanish police.And then, one Wednesday at the beginning of their third year at Cambridge, Daisy's father beat Daisy's mother at chess. He was made so happy by this, so elated and triumphant that, buoyed and emboldened by his conquest, he proposed marriage; and Daisy's mother, who had been, deep down, afraid that as soon as he won a game he would lose interest in her, said yes, of course.They stayed in England and remained in academia, and they had one daughter, whom they called Daisy because at the time they owned (and, to Daisy's later amusement, actually rode) a tandem - a bicycle built for two. They moved from university to university across Britain: he taught computer sciences while his wife wrote books that nobody wanted to read about international corporate hegemonies, and books that people did want to read about chess, its strategies and its history, and thus in a good year she would make more money than he did, which was never very much. Their involvement in politics waned as they grew older, and as they approached middle age they had become a happy couple with no interests beyond each other, chess, Daisy, and the reconstruction and debugging of forgotten operating systems.Neither of them understood Daisy, not even a little.They blamed themselves for not having nipped her fascination with the police force in the bud when it first began to manifest, more or less at the same time that she began talking. Daisy would point out police cars in the same excited way that other little girls might point out ponies. Her seventh birthday party was held in fancy dress to allow her to wear her junior policewoman's costume, and there are still photographs in a box in her parents' attic of her face suffused with a seven-year-old's perfect joy at the sight of her birthday cake: seven candles ringing a flashing blue light.Daisy was a diligent, cheerful, intelligent teenager who made both her parents happy when she went to the University of London to study law and computing. Her father had dreams of her becoming a lecturer in law; her mother nurtured dreams of her daughter taking silk, perhaps even becoming a judge and then using the law to crush corporate hegemonies whenever they appeared. And then Daisy went and ruined everything by taking the entry exams and joining the police force. The police welcomed her with open arms: on the one hand, there were directives on the need to improve the diversity of the force, while on the other, computer crime and computer-related fraud was on the increase. They needed Daisy. Frankly, they needed a whole string of Daisies.At this point, four years on, it would be fair to say that a career in the police force had failed to live up to Daisy's expectations. It was not, as her parents had warned her repeatedly, that the police force was an institutionally racist and sexist monolith that would crush her individuality into something soul-destroying and uniform, that would make her as much a part of the canteen culture as instant coffee. No, the frustrating part of it was getting other coppers to understand that she was a copper, too. She had come to the conclusion that, for most coppers, police work was something you did to protect Middle England from scary people of the wrong social background, who were probably out to steal their cell phones. From where Daisy stood it was about something else. Daisy knew that a kid in his den in Germany could send out a virus that would shut down a hospital, causing more damage than a bomb. Daisy was of the opinion that the real bad guys these days understood FTP sites and high-level encryption and disposable prepaid cell phones. She was not sure that the good guys did.She took a sip of coffee from a plastic cup and made a face; while she had been paging through screen after screen, her coffee had gone cold.She had gone through all the information that Grahame Coats had given her. There was certainly a prima facie case for thinking that something was wrong - if nothing else there was a check for two thousand pounds that Charles Nancy had apparently written to himself the previous week.Except. Except something did not feel right.She walked down the corridor and knocked on the superintendent's door.""Come!""Camberwell had smoked a pipe at his desk for thirty years, until the building had instituted a no-smoking policy. Now he made do with a lump of Plasticine, which he balled and squashed and kneaded and prodded. As a man with a pipe in his mouth, he had been placid, good-natured, and, as far as those beneath him were concerned, the salt of the earth. As a man with a lump of Plasticine in his hand, he was uniformly irritable and short-tempered. On a good day he made it as far as tetchy.""Yes?""""The Grahame Coats Agency case.""""Mm?""""I'm not sure about it.""""Not sure about it? What on earth is there not to be sure about?""""Well, I think maybe I should take myself off the case.""He did not look impressed. He stared at her. Down on the desk, unwatched, his fingers were kneading the blue Plasticine into the shape of a meerschaum. ""Because?""""I've met the suspect socially.""""And? You've been on holiday with him? You're godmother to his kids? What?""""No. I met him once. I stayed overnight at his house.""""So are you saying you and he did the nasty?"" A deep sigh, in which world-weariness, irritation, and a craving for half an ounce of Condor ready-rubbed mingled in equal parts.""No sir. Nothing like that. I just slept there.""""And that's your total involvement with him?""""Yes sir.""He crushed the Plasticine pipe back into a shapeless blob. ""You realize you're wasting my time?""""Yes sir. Sorry sir.""""Do whatever you have to do. Don't bother me.""Maeve Livingstone rode the lift up to the fifth floor alone, the slow jerky journey giving her plenty of time to rehearse in her head what she would say to Grahame Coats when she got there.She was carrying a slim brown briefcase, which had belonged to Morris: a peculiarly masculine object. She wore a white blouse and a blue denim skirt and over it, a gray coat. She had very long legs and extremely pale skin and hair which remained, with only minimal chemical assistance, quite as blonde as it had been when Morris Livingstone had married her twenty years earlier.Maeve had loved Morris very much. When he died, she did not delete him from her cell phone, not even after she had canceled his service and returned his phone. Her nephew had taken the photo of Morris that was on her phone, and she did not want to lose that. She wished she could phone Morris now, ask his advice.She had told the speakerphone who she was, to be buzzed in downstairs, and when she walked into reception Grahame Coats was already waiting for her.""How de do, how de do, good lady,"" he said.""We need to talk privately, Grahame,"" said Maeve. ""Now.""Grahame Coats smirked; oddly enough, many of his private fantasies began with Maeve saying something fairly similar, before she went on to utter such statements as ""I need you, Grahame, right now,"" and ""Oh Grahame, I've been such a bad bad bad bad girl who needs to be taught some discipline,"" and, on rare occasions, ""Grahame, you are too much for one woman, so let me introduce you to my identical naked twin sister, Maeve II.""They went into his office.Maeve, slightly disappointingly as far as Grahame Coats was concerned, said nothing about needing it right here, right now. She did not take off her coat. Instead she opened her briefcase and took out a sheaf of papers, which she placed upon the desk.""Grahame, at my bank manager's suggestion, I had your figures and statements for the last decade independently audited. From back when Morris was still alive. You can look at them if you like. The numbers don't work. None of them. I thought I'd talk to you about it before I called in the police. In Morris's memory, I felt I owed you that.""""You do indeed,"" agreed Grahame Coats, smooth as a snake in a butter churn. ""Indeed you do.""""Well?"" Maeve Livingstone raised one perfect eyebrow. Her expression was not reassuring. Grahame Coats liked her better in his imagination.""I'm afraid we've had a rogue employee at the Grahame Coats Agency for quite a while, Maeve. I actually called in the police myself, last week, when I realized that something was amiss. The long arm of the law is already investigating. Due to the illustrious nature of several of the clients of the Grahame Coats Agency - yourself among them - the police are keeping this as quiet as possible, and who can blame them?"" She did not seem as mollified as he had hoped. He tried another tack. ""They have high hopes of recovering much, if not all, of the money.""Maeve nodded. Grahame Coats relaxed, but only a little.""Can I ask which employee?""""Charles Nancy. I have to say I trusted him implicitly. It came as quite a shock.""""Oh. He's sweet.""""Appearances,"" pointed out Grahame Coats, ""can be deceptive.""She smiled then, and a very sweet smile it was. ""It won't wash, Grahame. This has been going on for yonks. Since long before Charles Nancy started here. Probably since before my time. Morris absolutely trusted you, and you stole from him. And now you're trying to tell me that you're hoping to frame one of your employees - or blame one of your confederates - well, it won't wash.""""No,"" said Grahame Coats, contritely. ""Sorry.""She picked up the sheaf of papers. ""Out of interest,"" she said, ""how much do you think you got from Morris and me over the years? I make it about three million quid.""""Ah."" He was not smiling at all, now. It was certainly more than that, but still. ""That sounds about right.""They looked at each other, and Grahame Coats calculated, furiously. He needed to buy time. That was what he needed. ""What if,"" he said, ""what if I were to repay it, in full, in cash, now. With interest. Let's say, fifty percent of the amount in question.""""You're offering me four and a half million pounds? In cash?""Grahame Coats smiled at her in exactly the same way that striking cobras tend not to. ""Absa-tively. If you go to the police, then I will deny everything, and hire excellent lawyers. In a worst-case scenario, after an extremely lengthy trial, during which I shall be forced to blacken Morris's good name in every way I possibly can, I will be sentenced at most to ten to twelve years in prison. I might actually serve five years, with good behavior - and I should be a model prisoner. Given the general overcrowding of the prison services, I'd serve most of my sentence in an open prison, or even on day release. I don't see this as being too problematic. On the flip side, I can guarantee that if you go to the police, you will never get a penny of Morris's money. The alternative is to keep your mouth shut, get all the money you need and more, while I buy myself a little time to- to do the decent thing. If you see what I mean.""Maeve thought about it. ""I would like to see you rot in prison,"" she said. And then she sighed, and nodded. ""All right,"" she said. ""I take the money. I never have to see or deal with you again. All future royalty checks come directly to me.""""Absatively. The safe is over here,"" he told her.There was a bookcase on the far wall, on which were uniform leatherbound editions of Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope, and Austen, all unread. He fumbled with a book, and the bookcase slipped to one side, revealing a door behind it, painted to match the wall.Maeve wondered if it would have a combination, but no, there was just a small keyhole, which Grahame Coats unlocked with a large brass key. The door swung open.He reached in and turned on the light. It was a narrow room, lined with rather amateurishly fixed shelves. At the far end was a small, fireproof filing cabinet.""You can take it in cash, or in jewelry, or in a combination of the two,"" he said, bluntly. ""I'd advise the latter. Lots of nice antique gold back there. Very portable.""He unlocked several strongboxes and displayed the contents. Rings and chains and lockets glittered and gleamed and shone.Maeve's mouth opened. ""Take a look,"" he told her, and she squeezed past him. It was a treasure cave.She pulled out a golden locket on a chain, held it up, stared at it in wonder. ""This is gorgeous,"" she said. ""It must be worth -"" and she broke off. In the polished gold of the locket she saw something moving behind her, and she turned, which meant that the hammer did not hit her squarely on the back of the head, as Grahame Coats had intended, but instead glanced off the side of her cheek.""You little shit!"" she said, and she kicked him. Maeve had good legs and a powerful kick, but she and her attacker were at close quarters.Maeve's foot connected with his shin, and she reached for the hammer he was holding. Grahame Coats smashed out with it; this time it connected, and Maeve stumbled to one side. Her eyes seemed to unfocus. He hit her again, squarely on the top of the head, and again, and again, and she went down.Grahame Coats wished that he had a gun. A nice, sensible handgun. With a silencer, like in the films. Honestly, if it had ever occurred to him that he would need to kill someone in his office he would have been much better prepared for it. He might even have laid in a supply of poison. That would have been wise. No need for any of this nonsense.There was blood and blonde hair adhering to the end of the hammer. He put it down with distaste and, stepping around the woman on the floor, grabbed the safe-deposit boxes containing the jewelry. He tipped them out onto his desk and returned them to the safe, where he removed an attaché case containing bundles of hundred-dollar bills and of five-hundred euro notes, and a small black velvet bag half full of unset diamonds. He removed some files from the filing cabinet. And, last but - as he would have pointed out - by no means least, he took out from the secret room the small leather vanity case containing two wallets and two passports.Then he pushed the heavy door closed, and locked it, and swung the bookcase back into position.He stood there, panting somewhat, and caught his breath.All in all, he decided, he was rather proud of himself. Good job, Grahame. Good man. Good show. He had improvised with the materials at hand and come out ahead: bluffed and been bold and creative - ready, as the poet said, to risk it all on a turn of pitch-and-toss. He had risked, and he had won. He was the pitcher. He was the tosser. One day, on his tropical paradise, he would write his memoirs, and people would learn how he had bested a dangerous woman. Although, he thought, it might be better if she had actually been holding a gun.Probably, he realized on reflection, she had pulled a gun on him. He was fairly sure he had seen her reach for it. He had been extremely fortunate that the hammer had been there, that he had a tool kit in the room for moments of necessary DIY, or he would not have been able to act in self-defense with it so swiftly or so effectively.Only now did it occur to him to lock the main door to his office.There was, he noticed, blood on his shirt and on his hand, and on the sole of one shoe. He took off his shirt, and wiped down his shoe with it. Then he dropped the shirt into the bin beneath his desk. He surprised himself by putting his hand to his mouth and licking the gobbet of blood off it, like a cat, with his red tongue.And then he yawned. He took Maeve's papers from the desk, ran them through the shredder. She had a second set of documents in her briefcase, and he shredded them as well. He reshredded the shreddings.He had a closet in the corner of his office, with a suit hanging in it, and spare shirts, socks, underpants, and so on. You never knew when you would need to head to a first night from the office, after all. Be prepared.He dressed with care.There was a small suitcase with wheels in it in the closet, too, of the kind that is meant to be placed in overhead lockers, and he put things into it, moving them around to make room.He called reception. ""Annie,"" he said. ""Would you pop out and get me a sandwich? Not from Prêt, no. I thought the new place in Brewer Street? I'm just wrapping up with Mrs Livingstone. I may actually wind up taking her out for a spot of real lunch, but best to be prepared.""He spent several minutes on the computer, running the kind of disk-cleaning program that takes your data, overwrites it with random ones and zeroes, then grinds it up extremely small before finally depositing it at the bottom of the Thames wearing concrete overshoes. Then he walked down the hall, pulling his wheeled suitcase behind him.He put his head around one office door. ""Popping out for a bit,"" he said. ""I'll be back in about three, if anyone asks.""Annie was gone from reception, which, he thought, was a good thing. People would assume that Maeve Livingstone had already left the agency, just as they would expect Grahame Coats to return at any time. By the time they started looking for him, he would be a long way away.He descended in the lift. This was all happening early, he thought. He would not turn fifty for more than a year. But the exit mechanisms were already in place. He needed simply to think of it as a golden handshake, or perhaps a golden parachute.And then, pulling the wheelie suitcase behind him, he walked out of the front door into the sunny Aldwych morning, and out of the Grahame Coats Agency forever.Spider had slept peacefully in his own enormous bed, in his place in Fat Charlie's spare room. He had begun to wonder, in a vague sort of way, whether Fat Charlie had gone for good, and had resolved to investigate the matter the next time that he could in any way be bothered to do so, unless something more interesting distracted him or he forgot.He had slept late, and was now on his way to meet Rosie for lunch. He would pick her up at her flat, and they would go somewhere good. It was a beautiful day in early autumn, and Spider's happiness was infectious. This was because Spider was, give or take a little, a god. When you're a god, your emotions are contagious - other people can catch them. When people stood near Spider on a day that he was this happy, their worlds would seem a little brighter. If he hummed a song, other people around him would start humming, in key, like something from a musical. Of course, if he yawned, a hundred people nearby would yawn, and when he was miserable it spread like a damp river-mist, making the world even gloomier for everyone caught up in it. It wasn't anything he did; it was something that he was.Right now, the only thing casting a damper on his happiness was that he had resolved to tell Rosie the truth.Spider was not terribly good at telling the truth. He regarded truth as fundamentally malleable, more or less a matter of opinion, and Spider was able to muster some pretty impressive opinions when he had to.Being an imposter was not the problem. He liked being an imposter. He was good at it. It fitted in with his plans, which were fairly simple and could until now have been summarized more or less as: (a) go somewhere; (b) enjoy yourself; and (c) leave before you get bored. And it was now, he knew deep down, definitely time to leave. The world was his lobster, his bib was round his neck, and he had a pot of melted butter and an array of grotesque but effective lobster-eating implements and devices at the ready.Only-Only he didn't want to go.He was having second thoughts about all this, something Spider found fairly disconcerting. Normally he didn't even have first thoughts about things. Life without thinking had been perfectly pleasant - instinct, impulse, and an obscene amount of luck had served him quite well up to now. But even miracles can only take you so far. Spider walked down the street, and people smiled at him.He had agreed with Rosie that he would meet her at her flat, so he was pleasantly surprised to see her standing at the end of the road, waiting for him. He felt a pang of something that was still not entirely guilt, and waved.""Rosie? Hey!""She came toward him along the pavement, and he began to grin. They would sort things out. Everything would work out for the best. Everything would be fine. ""You look like a million dollars,"" he told her. ""Maybe two million. What are you hungry for?""Rosie smiled and shrugged.They were passing a Greek restaurant. ""Is Greek okay?"" She nodded. They walked down some steps and went inside. It was dark and empty, having only just opened, and the proprietor pointed them toward a nook, or possibly a cranny, toward the rear.They sat opposite each other, at a table just big enough for two. Spider said, ""There's something that I wanted to talk to you about."" She said nothing. ""It's not bad,"" he went on. ""Well, it's not good. But. Well. It's something you ought to know.""The proprietor asked them if they were ready to order anything. ""Coffee,"" said Spider, and Rosie nodded her agreement. ""Two coffees,"" said Spider. ""And if you can give us, um, five minutes? I need a little privacy here.""The proprietor withdrew.Rosie looked at Spider inquiringly.He took a deep breath. ""Right. Okay. Let me just say this, because it isn't easy, and I don't know that I can- right. Okay. Look, I'm not Fat Charlie. I know you think I am, but I'm not. I'm his brother, Spider. You think I'm him because we sort of look alike.""She did not say anything.""Well, I don't really look like him. But. Y'know, none of this really comes easy to me. Ookay. Uh. I can't stop thinking about you. So I mean, I know you're engaged to my brother, but I'm sort of asking if you, well, if you'd think about maybe dumping him and possibly going out with me.""A pot of coffee arrived on a small silver tray, with two cups.""Greek coffee,"" said the proprietor, who had brought it.""Yes. Thanks. I did ask for a couple of minutes-""""Is very hot,"" said the proprietor. ""Very hot coffee. Strong. Greek. Not Turkish.""""That's great. Listen, if you don't mind - five minutes. Please?""The proprietor shrugged and walked away.""You probably hate me,"" said Spider. ""If I was you I'd probably hate me, too. But I mean this. More than I've ever meant anything in my life."" She was just looking at him, without expression, and he said, ""Please. Just say something. Anything.""Her lips moved, as if she were trying to find the right words to say.Spider waited.Her mouth opened.His first thought was that she was eating something, because the thing he saw between her teeth was brown, and was certainly not a tongue. Then it moved its head and its eyes, little black-bead eyes, stared at him. Rosie opened her mouth impossibly wide and the birds came out.Spider said ""Rosie?"" and then the air was filled with beaks and feathers and claws, one after the other. Birds poured out from her throat, each accompanied by a tiny coughing-choking noise, in a stream directed at him.He threw up an arm to protect his eyes, and something hurt his wrist. He flailed out, and something flew at his face, heading for his eyes. He jerked his head backward, and the beak punctured his cheek.A moment of nightmare clarity: there was still a woman sitting opposite him. What he could no longer understand was how he could ever have mistaken her for Rosie. She was older than Rosie, for a start, her blue-black hair streaked here and there with silver. Her skin was not the warm brown of Rosie's skin but black as flint. She was wearing a ragged ochre raincoat. And she grinned and opened her mouth wide once more, and now inside her mouth he could see the cruel beaks and crazy eyes of seagulls-.Spider did not stop to think. He acted. He grabbed the handle of the coffeepot, swept it up in one hand, while with the other he pulled off the lid; then he jerked the pot toward the woman in the seat opposite him. The contents of the pot, scalding hot black coffee, went all over her.She hissed in pain.Birds crashed and flapped through the air of the cellar restaurant, but now there was nobody sitting opposite him, and the birds flew without direction, flapping into walls wildly.The proprietor said, ""Sir? Are you hurt? I am sorry. They must have come in from the street.""""I'm fine,"" said Spider.""Your face is bleeding,"" said the man. He handed Spider a napkin, and Spider pressed it against his cheek. The cut stung.Spider offered to help the man get the birds out. He opened the door to the street, but now the place was as empty of birds as it had been before his arrival.Spider pulled out a five-pound note. ""Here,"" he said. ""For the coffee. I've got to go.""The proprietor nodded, gratefully. ""Keep the napkin.""Spider stopped and thought. ""When I came in,"" he asked, ""was there a woman with me?""The proprietor looked puzzled - possibly even scared, Spider could not be sure. ""I do not remember,"" he said, as if dazed. ""If you had been alone, I would not have seated you back there. But I do not know.""Spider went back out into the street. The day was still bright, but the sunlight no longer seemed reassuring. He looked around. He saw a pigeon, shuffling and pecking at an abandoned ice cream cone; a sparrow on a window ledge; and, high above, a flash of white in the sunlight, its wings extended, a seagull circled.
AB_ch9	AB	Anansi Boys	9	5714	32459	CHAPTER NINEIN WHICH FAT CHARLIE ANSWERS THE DOOR AND SPIDER ENCOUNTERS FLAMINGOSFat Charlie's luck was changing. He could feel it. The plane on which he was returning home had been oversold, and he had found himself bumped up to first class. The meal was excellent. Halfway across the Atlantic, a flight attendant came over to inform him that he had won a complimentary box of chocolates, and presented it to him. He put it in his overhead locker, and ordered a Drambuie on ice.He would get home. He would sort everything out with Grahame Coats - after all, if there was one thing that Fat Charlie was certain of, it was the honesty of his own accounting. He would make everything good with Rosie. Everything was going to be just great.He wondered if Spider would already be gone when he got home, or whether he would get the satisfaction of throwing him out. He hoped it would be the latter. Fat Charlie wanted to see his brother apologize, possibly even grovel. He started to imagine the things that he was going to say.""Get out!"" said Fat Charlie, ""And take your sunshine, your Jacuzzi, and your bedroom with you!""""Sorry?"" said the flight attendant.""Talking,"" said Fat Charlie. ""To myself. Just um.""But even the embarrassment he felt at this wasn't really that bad. He didn't even hope the plane would crash and end his mortification. Life was definitely looking up.He opened the little kit of useful amenities he had been given, and put on his eyeshade, and pushed his seat back as far as it would go, which was most of the way. He thought about Rosie, although the Rosie in his mind kept shifting, morphing into someone smaller who wasn't really wearing much of anything. Fat Charlie guiltily imagined her dressed, and was mortified when he realized that she seemed to be wearing a police uniform. He felt terrible about this, he told himself, but it didn't seem to make much of an impression. He ought to feel ashamed of himself. He ought to-.Fat Charlie shifted in his seat and emitted one small, satisfied snore.He was still in an excellent mood when he landed at Heathrow. He took the Heathrow Express into Paddington and was pleased to note that in his brief absence from England the sun had decided to come out. Every little thing, he told himself, is going to be all right.The only odd note, which added a flavor of wrongness to the morning, occurred halfway through the train journey. He was staring out of the window, wishing he had bought a newspaper at Heathrow. The train was passing an expanse of green - a school playing field, perhaps, when the sky seemed, momentarily, to darken, and, with a hiss of brakes, the train stopped at a signal.That did not disturb Fat Charlie. It was England in the autumn: the sun was, by definition, something that only happened when it wasn't cloudy or raining. But there was a figure standing on the edge of the green by a stand of trees.At first glance, he thought it was a scarecrow.That was foolish. It could not have been a scarecrow. Scarecrows are found in fields, not on football pitches. Scarecrows certainly aren't left on the edge of the woodland. Anyway, if it was a scarecrow it was doing a very poor job.There were crows everywhere, after all, big black ones.And then it moved.It was too far away to be anything more than a shape, a slight figure in a tattered brown raincoat. Still, Fat Charlie knew it. He knew that if he had been close enough, he would have seen a face chipped from obsidian, and raven-black hair, and eyes that held madness.Then the train jerked and began to move, and in moments the woman in the brown raincoat was out of sight.Fat Charlie felt uncomfortable. He had practically convinced himself by now that what had happened, what he thought had happened, in Mrs. Dunwiddy's front room had been some form of hallucination, a high-octane dream, true on some level but not a real thing. Not something that had happened; rather, it was symbolic of a greater truth. He could not have gone to a real place, nor struck a real bargain, could he?It was only a metaphor, after all.He did not ask himself why he was now so certain that everything would soon begin to improve. There was reality, and there was reality, and some things were more real than others.Faster and faster, the train rattled him further into London.Spider was almost home from the Greek restaurant, napkin pushed against his cheek, when someone touched him on the shoulder.""Charles?"" said Rosie.Spider jumped, or at least, he jerked and made a startled noise.""Charles? Are you all right? What happened to your cheek?""He stared at her. ""Are you you?"" he asked.""What?""""Are you Rosie?""""What kind of a question is that? Of course I'm Rosie. What did you do to your cheek?""He pressed the napkin against his cheek. ""I cut it,"" he said.""Let me see?"" She took his hand away from his cheek. The center of the white napkin was stained crimson, as if he had bled into it, but his cheek was whole and untouched. ""There's nothing there.""""Oh.""""Charles? Are you all right?""""Yes,"" he said. ""I am. Unless I'm not. I think we should go back to my place. I think I'll be safer there.""""We were going to have lunch,"" said Rosie, in the tone of voice of one who worries that she'll only understand what's actually going on when a TV presenter leaps out and reveals the hidden cameras.""Yes,"" said Spider. ""I know. I think someone just tried to kill me, though. And she pretended she was you.""""Nobody's trying to kill you,"" said Rosie, failing to sound like she wasn't humoring him.""Even if nobody's trying to kill me, can we skip lunch and go back to my place? I've got food there.""""Of course.""Rosie followed him down the road, wondering when Fat Charlie had lost all that weight. He looked good, she thought. He looked really good. They walked into Maxwell Gardens in silence.He said, ""Look at that.""""What?""He showed her. The fresh bloodstain had vanished from the napkin. It was now perfectly white.""Is it a magic trick?""""If it is, I didn't do it,"" he said. ""For once."" He dropped the napkin into a bin. As he did so, a taxi pulled up in front of Fat Charlie's house, and Fat Charlie got out, rumpled and blinking and carrying a white plastic bag.Rosie looked at Fat Charlie. She looked at Spider. She looked back at Fat Charlie, who had opened the bag and pulled out an enormous box of chocolates.""They're for you,"" he said.Rosie took the chocolates and said, ""Thank you."" There were two men and they looked and sounded completely different, and she still could not work out which one of them was her fiancée. ""I'm going mad, aren't I?"" she said, her voice taut. It was easier, now she knew what was wrong.The thinner of the two Fat Charlies, the one with the earring, put his hand on her shoulder. ""You need to go home,"" he said. ""Then you need a nap. When you wake up, you'll have forgotten all about this.""Well, she thought, that makes life easier. It's better with a plan. She walked back to her flat with a spring in her step, carrying her box of chocolates.""What did you do?"" asked Fat Charlie. ""She just seemed to turn off.""Spider shrugged. ""I didn't want to upset her,"" he said.""Why didn't you tell her the truth?""""It didn't seem appropriate.""""Like you'd know what was appropriate?""Spider touched the front door and it opened.""I have keys, you know,"" said Fat Charlie. ""It's my front door.""They walked into the hallway, walked up the stairs.""Where have you been?"" asked Spider.""Nowhere. Out,"" said Fat Charlie, as if he were a teenager.""I was attacked by birds in the restaurant this morning. Do you know anything about that? You do, don't you.""""Not really. Maybe. It's just time for you to leave, that's all.""""Don't start anything,"" said Spider.""Me? Me start anything? I think I've been a model of restraint. You came into my life. You got my boss upset, and got the police onto me. You, you've been kissing my girlfriend. You screwed up my life.""""Hey,"" said Spider. ""You ask me, you've done a great job of screwing up your life on your own.""Fat Charlie clenched his fist, swung back, and hit Spider in the jaw, like they do on the movies. Spider staggered back, more surprised than hurt. He put his hand to his lip, then looked down at the blood on his hand. ""You hit me,"" he said.""I can do it again,"" said Fat Charlie, who wasn't sure that he could. His hand hurt.Spider said ""Yeah?"" and launched himself at Fat Charlie, pummeling him with his fists, and Fat Charlie went over, his arm around Spider's waist, pulling Spider down with him.They rolled up and down the hallway floor, hitting and flailing at each other. Fat Charlie half-expected Spider to launch some kind of magical counterattack or to be supernaturally strong, but the two of them seemed fairly evenly matched. Both of them fought unscientifically, like boys - like brothers - and as they fought, Fat Charlie thought he remembered doing this once before, a long, long time ago. Spider was smarter and faster, but if Fat Charlie could just get on top of him, and get Spider's hands out of the way-.Fat Charlie grabbed for Spider's right hand, twisted it behind Spider's back, then sat on his brother's chest, putting all his weight on him.""Give in?"" he asked.""No."" Spider wriggled and twisted, but Fat Charlie was solidly in position, sitting on Spider's chest.""I want you to promise,"" said Fat Charlie, ""to get out of my life, and to leave me and Rosie alone forever.""At this, Spider bucked, angrily, and Fat Charlie was dislodged. He landed, sprawled, on the kitchen floor. ""Look,"" said Spider. ""I told you.""There was a banging on the door downstairs, an imperious knocking of the kind that indicated someone needed to come in rather urgently. Fat Charlie glared at Spider, and Spider scowled at Fat Charlie, and slowly they got to their feet.""Shall I answer it?"" said Spider.""No,"" said Fat Charlie. ""It's my bloody house. And I'm going to bloody answer my own front door, thank you very much.""""Whatever.""Fat Charlie edged toward the stairs. Then he turned around. ""Once I've dealt with this,"" he said, ""I'm dealing with you. Pack your stuff. You are on your way out."" He walked downstairs, tucking himself in, brushing the dust off, and generally trying to make it look as if he hadn't been brawling on the floor.He opened the door. There were two large uniformed policemen and one smaller, rather more exotic policewoman in extremely plain clothes.""Charles Nancy?"" said Daisy. She looked at him as if he was a stranger, her eyes expressionless.""Glumph,"" said Fat Charlie.""Mister Nancy,"" she said, ""you are under arrest. You have the right -""Fat Charlie turned back to the interior of the house. ""Bastard!"" he shouted up the stairs. ""Bastard bastard bastarding bastardy bastard!""Daisy tapped him on the arm. ""Do you want to come quietly?"" she asked, quietly. ""Only if you don't, we can subdue you first. I wouldn't recommend it, though. They're very enthusiastic subduers.""""I'll come quietly,"" said Fat Charlie.""That's good,"" said Daisy. She walked Fat Charlie outside and locked him into the back of a black police van.The police searched the flat. The rooms were empty of life. At the end of the hall was a little spare bedroom, containing several boxes of books and toy cars. They poked around in there, but they didn't find anything interesting.Spider lay on the couch in his bedroom, and sulked. HE had gone to his room when Fat Charlie went off to answer the door. He needed to be on his own. He didn't do confrontations terribly well. When it got to that point was normally when he went away, and right now Spider knew it was time to go, but he still didn't want to leave.He wasn't sure that sending Rosie home was the right thing to have done.What he wanted to do - and Spider was driven entirely by wants, never by oughts or shoulds - was to tell Rosie that he wanted her - he, Spider. That he wasn't Fat Charlie. That he was something quite different. And that, in itself, wasn't the problem. He could simply have said to her, with enough conviction, ""I'm actually Spider, Fat Charlie's brother, and you're completely okay with this. It doesn't bother you,"" and the universe would have pushed Rosie just a little, and she would have accepted it, just as she'd gone home earlier. She'd be fine with it. She would not have minded it, not at all.Except, he knew, somewhere deep inside, she would.Human beings do not like being pushed about by gods. They may seem to, on the surface, but somewhere on the inside, underneath it all, they sense it, and they resent it. They know. Spider could tell her to be happy about the situation, and she would be happy, but it would be as real as painting a smile on her face - a smile that she would truly believe, in every way that mattered, was her own. In the short term (and until now Spider had only ever thought in the short term) none of this would be important, but in the long term it could only lead to problems. He didn't want some kind of seething, furious creature, someone who, though she hated him way down deep, was perfectly placid and doll-like and normal on the surface. He wanted Rosie.And that wouldn't be Rosie, would it?Spider stared out of the window at the glorious waterfall and the tropical sky beyond it, and Spider began to wonder when Fat Charlie would come knocking on his door. Something had happened this morning in the restaurant, and he was certain that his brother knew more about it than he was saying.After a while, he got bored with waiting, and wandered back into Fat Charlie's flat. There was nobody there. The place was a mess - it looked like it had been turned upside down by trained professionals. Spider decided that, in all probability, Fat Charlie had messed the place up himself to indicate how upset he was that Spider had beaten him in their fight.He looked out of the window. There was a police car parked outside beside a black police van. As he watched, they drove away.He made himself some toast, and he buttered it and ate it. Then he walked through the flat, carefully closing all the curtains.The doorbell rang. Spider closed the last of the curtains, then he walked downstairs.He opened the door and Rosie looked at him. She still seemed a little dazed. He looked at her. ""Well? Aren't you going to invite me in?""""Of course. Come in.""She walked up the stairs. ""What happened here? It looks like an earthquake hit.""""Yeah?""""Why are you just sitting in the dark?"" She went to open the curtains.""Don't do that! Just keep them closed.""""What are you scared of?"" asked Rosie.Spider looked out of the window. ""Birds,"" he said, eventually.""But birds are our friends,"" said Rosie, as if addressing a small child.""Birds,"" Spider said, ""are the last of the dinosaurs. Tiny velociraptors with wings. Devouring defenseless wiggly things and, and nuts, and fish, and, and other birds. They get the early worms. And have you ever watched a chicken eat? They may look innocent, but birds are, well, they're vicious.""""There was a thing on the news the other day,"" said Rosie, ""about a bird who saved a man's life.""""That doesn't change the fact that -""""It was a raven, or a crow. One of those big black ones. The man was lying on the lawn in his home in California, reading a magazine, and he hears this cawing and cawing, and it's a raven, trying to attract his attention. So he gets up and goes over to the tree it's perched on, and down beneath it is a mountain lion, that had been getting all ready to pounce on him. So he went inside. If that raven hadn't warned him, he would have been lion-food.""""I don't think that's usual raven behavior,"" said Spider. ""But whether one raven once saved someone's life or not, it doesn't change anything. Birds are still out to get me.""""Right,"" said Rosie, trying to sound as if she wasn't humoring him. ""Birds are out to get you.""""Yes.""""And this is because-?""""Um.""""There must be a reason. You can't tell me the great plurality of birds has just decided to treat you as an enormous early worm for no particular reason.""He said, ""I don't think you'd believe me,"" and he meant it.""Charlie. You've always been really honest. I mean, I've trusted you. If you tell me something, I'll do my best to believe it. I'll try really hard. I love you and I believe in you. So why don't you let me find out if I believe you or not?""Spider thought about this. Then he reached out for her hand, and he squeezed it.""I think I ought to show you something,"" he said.He led her to the end of the corridor. They stopped outside the door to Fat Charlie's spare room. ""There's something in here,"" he said. ""I think it'll explain it a bit better than I can.""""You're a superhero,"" she said, ""and this is where you keep the batpoles?""""No.""""Is it something kinky? You like to dress up in a twinset and pearls and call yourself Dora?""""No.""""It's not- a model train set, is it?""Spider pushed open the door to Fat Charlie's spare room, and at the same time he opened the door to his bedroom. The picture windows at the end of the room showed a waterfall, which crashed down into a jungle pool far below. The sky though the windows was bluer than sapphires.Rosie made a small noise.She turned around, walked back down the hall, into the kitchen, and looked out of the window at the gray London sky, doughy and unwelcoming. She came back. ""I don't understand,"" she said. ""Charlie? What's happening?""""I'm not Charlie,"" said Spider. ""Look at me. Really look at me. I don't even look like him.""She made no pretense of humoring him any longer. Her eyes were wide and scared.""I'm his brother,"" said Spider. ""I've screwed everything up. Everything. And I think probably the best thing I can do is just get out of all your lives and go away.""""So where's Fat - where's Charlie?""""I don't know. We were having a fight. He went off to answer the door, and I went off to my room, and he didn't come back.""""He didn't come back? And you didn't even try to find out what had happened to him?""""Er. He might have been taken away by the police,"" said Spider. ""It's just an idea. I have no proof or anything.""""What's your name?"" she demanded.""Spider.""Rosie repeated it. ""Spider."" Outside the window, above the spray of the waterfall, she could see a flock of flamingos in the air, the sunlight blurring their wings in pink and white. They were stately and uncountable, and it was one of the most beautiful things Rosie had ever seen. She looked back at Spider, and looking at him, she could not understand how she had ever believed that this man was Fat Charlie. Where Fat Charlie was easygoing, open, and uncomfortable, this man was like a steel rod bent back and ready to snap. ""You really aren't him, are you?""""I told you I wasn't.""""So. So who did I. Who have I. Who was it - who did I sleep with?""""That would be me,"" said Spider.""I thought so,"" said Rosie. She slapped him, as hard as she could, across his face. He could feel his lip start bleeding once more.""I guess I deserved that,"" he said.""Of course you deserved it."" She paused. Then she said, ""Did Fat Charlie know about this? About you? That you were going out with me?""""Well, yes. But he-""""You are both sick,"" she said. ""Sick, sick, evil men. I hope you rot in Hell.""She took one last puzzled glance around the enormous bedroom and then out of the bedroom window at the jungle trees and the huge waterfall and the flock of flamingos, and she walked away down the hall.Spider sat down on the floor with a thin trickle of blood coming from his lower lip, feeling stupid. He heard the front door slam. He walked over to the hot tub and dipped the end of a fluffy towel into the hot water. Then he wrung it out and put it on his mouth. ""I don't need any of this,"" said Spider. He said it aloud; it's easier to lie to yourself when you say things out loud. ""I didn't need any of you people a week ago and I don't need you now. I don't care. I'm done.""The flamingos hit the window glass like feathery pink cannonballs, and the glass shattered, fragments of window flying across the room, scattering and embedding themselves in the walls, the floor, the bed. The air was filled with plummeting pale pink bodies, a confusion of huge pink wings, and curved black beaks. The roar of a waterfall exploded into the room.Spider pushed back against the wall. There were flamingos between him and the door, hundreds of them: five-foot-tall birds, all legs and neck. He got to his feet and took several steps through a minefield of angry pink birds, each of them glowering at him through mad pink eyes. From a distance, they might have been beautiful. One of them snapped at Spider's hand. It didn't break the skin, but it hurt.Spider's bedroom was a large room, but it was rapidly filling with crash-landing flamingos. And there was a dark cloud in the blue sky above the waterfall that appeared to be another flock on its way.They were pecking at him and clawing at him and buffeting him with their wings, and he knew that that was not actually the problem. The problem would be being suffocated under a fluffy pink blanket of feathers with birds attached. It would be an astonishingly undignified way to go, crushed by birds, and not even particularly intelligent birds.Think, he told himself. They're flamingos. Bird-brains. You're Spider.So? he thought back at himself, irritated. Tell me something I don't know.The flamingos on the ground were mobbing him. The ones in the air were diving toward him. He pulled his jacket over his head, and then the airborne flamingos began hitting him. It was like having someone firing chickens at you. He staggered and went down. Well, trick them, stupid.Spider pushed himself to his feet and waded through the sea of wings and beaks until he reached the window, now an open jaw of jagged glass.""Stupid birds,"" he said, cheerfully. He pulled himself up onto the window ledge.Flamingos are not famed for their cutting intelligence, nor for their problem-solving abilities: confronted with a twist of wire and a bottle with something edible in it, a crow might try to make a tool out of the wire in order to get at the contents of the bottle. A flamingo, on the other hand, will try and eat the wire, if it looks like a shrimp, or possibly even if it doesn't, just in case it was a new kind of shrimp. So if there was something slightly smoky and insubstantial about the man who stood on the window ledge insulting them, the flamingos failed to perceive it. They glared at him with the crazed ruby eyes of killer rabbits, and they rushed toward him.The man dove from the window, down into the spray of the waterfall, and a thousand flamingos launched themselves into the air after him, many of them, given the run-up a flamingo needs to get properly airborne, tumbling like stones.Soon the bedroom contained only injured or dead flamingos: the ones who had broken the windows, the ones who had crashed into the walls, the ones who had been crushed beneath other flamingos. Those of the birds who were still alive watched the bedroom door open, apparently by itself, and close again, but, being flamingos, they thought very little of it.Spider stood in the corridor of Fat Charlie's flat and tried to catch his breath. He concentrated on letting the bedroom stop existing, which was something that he hated to do, mostly because he was incredibly proud of his sound system, and also because it was where he kept his stuff.You can always get more stuff, though.If you're Spider, all you really have to do is ask.Rosie's mother was not a woman given to gloating loudly, so when Rosie broke down in tears on the Chippendale sofa, her mother refrained from whooping, from singing, or from doing a small victory dance and then shimmying around the room. A careful observer, however, might have noticed a glint of triumph in her eyes.She gave Rosie a large glass of vitaminized water with an ice cube in it and listened to her daughter's tearful litany of heartbreak and deception. By the end of it, the glint of triumph had been replaced with a look of confusion, and her head was starting to spin.""So Fat Charlie wasn't really Fat Charlie?"" said Rosie's mother.""No. Well, yes. Fat Charlie is Fat Charlie, but for the last week I've been seeing his brother.""""They are twins?""""No. I don't even think they look alike. I don't know. I'm so confused.""""So which one of them did you break up with?""Rosie blew her nose. ""I broke up with Spider. That's Fat Charlie's brother.""""But you weren't engaged to him.""""No, but I thought I was. I thought he was Fat Charlie.""""So you broke up with Fat Charlie as well?""""Sort of. I just haven't told him yet.""""Did he, did he know about this, this brother thing? Was it some kind of evil kinky conspiracy they did to my poor girl?""""I don't think so. But it doesn't matter. I can't marry him.""""No,"" agreed her mother. ""You certainly cannot. Not one bit."" Inside, in her head, she did a victory jig and set off a large but tasteful celebratory display of fireworks. ""We can find you a good boy. Don't you worry. That Fat Charlie. He was always up to no good. I knew it the first moment I saw him. He ate my wax fruit. I knew he was trouble. Where is he now?""""I'm not sure. Spider said he might have been taken away by the police,"" said Rosie.""Hah!"" said her mother, who increased the fireworks in her head to New Year's Eve at Disneyland proportions and mentally sacrificed a dozen flawless black bulls for good measure. Aloud, all she said was, ""Probably in prison, you ask me. Best place for him. I always said that was where that young man would end up.""Rosie began to cry, if anything even harder than before. She pulled out another wad of paper tissues and blew her nose with an extreme honk. She swallowed bravely. Then she cried some more. Her mother patted the back of Rosie's hand as reassuringly as she knew how. ""Of course you can't marry him,"" she said. ""You can't marry a convict. But if he's in prison you can easily break off the engagement."" A spectre of a smile haunted the corners of her lips as she said, ""I could call on him for you. Or go there on a visitor's day and tell him he's a lousy crook and you never want to see him again. We could get a restraining order, as well,"" she added helpfully.""Th-that's not why I can't marry Fat Charlie,"" said Rosie.""No?"" asked her mother, raising one perfectly penciled eyebrow.""No,"" said Rosie. ""I can't marry Fat Charlie because I'm not in love with him.""""Of course you aren't. I always knew that. It was a girlish infatuation, but now you see the true-""""I'm in love,"" continued Rosie, as if her mother had not spoken, ""with Spider. His brother."" The expression that made its way across her mother's face then was a cloud of wasps arriving at a picnic. ""It's okay,"" said Rosie. ""I'm not going to marry him, either. I've told him I never want to see him again.""Rosie's mother pursed her lips. ""Well,"" she said, ""I can't pretend I understand any of this, but I can't say it's bad news, either."" The gears in her head shifted, and the cogs interlocked in new and interesting ways: ratchets ratchetted and springs resprung. ""You know,"" she said, ""what would be the best thing for you right now? Have you thought about taking a little holiday? I'm happy to pay for it, all the money I'm saving on the wedding after all-""That may have been the wrong thing to say. Rosie began to sob into her tissues once again. Her mother went on, ""Anyway, it would be my treat. I know you've got holiday time you haven't used at work. And you said things were quiet right now. At a time like this, a girl needs to get away from everything and simply relax.""Rosie wondered whether she'd misjudged her mother all these years. She sniffed and swallowed and said, ""That would be nice.""""Then it's settled,"" said her mother. ""I shall come with you, to take care of my baby."" In her head, underneath the grand finale of the fireworks display, she added, And to make sure that my baby only meets the right sort of man.""Where are we going?"" asked Rosie.""We're going to go,"" said her mother, ""on a cruise.""Fat Charlie was not handcuffed. That was good. Everything else was bad, but at least he wasn't in handcuffs. Life had become a confused blur filled with too-sharp details: the duty sergeant scratching his nose and signing him in - ""Cell six is free"" - through a green door and then the smell of the cells, a low-level stench he had never before encountered but which was immediately and horribly familiar, a pervasive fug of yesterday's vomit and disinfectant and smoke and stale blankets and unflushed toilets and despair. It was the smell of things at the bottom, and that was where Fat Charlie seemed to have ended up.""When you need to flush the lavvy,"" said the policeman accompanying him down the corridor, ""you press the button in your cell. One of us'll be by, sooner or later, to pull the chain for you. Stops you trying to flush away the evidence.""""Evidence of what?""""Leave it out, Sunshine.""Fat Charlie sighed. He'd been flushing away his own bodily waste products since he'd been old enough to take a certain pride in the activity, and the loss of that, more than the loss of his liberty, told him that everything had changed.""It's your first time,"" said the policeman.""Sorry.""""Drugs?"" said the policeman.""No, thank you,"" said Fat Charlie.""Is that what you're in for?""""I don't know what I'm in for,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I'm innocent.""""White-collar crime, eh?"" said the policeman, and he shook his head. ""I'll tell you something the blue-collar boys know without being told. The easier you make it on us, the easier we make it on you. You white-collar people. Always standing up for your rights. You just make it harder on yourselves.""He opened the door to cell six. ""Home sweet home,"" he said.The cell-stench was worse inside the room, which had been painted in the kind of speckled paint that resists graffiti and contained only a shelflike bed, low to the ground, and a lidless toilet in the corner.Fat Charlie put the blanket he'd been issued down on the bed.""Right,"" said the policeman. ""Well. Make yourself at home. And if you get bored, please don't block the toilet with your blanket.""""Why would I do that?""""I often wonder that myself,"" said the policeman. ""Why indeed? Perhaps it breaks the monotony. I shouldn't know. Being a law-abiding sort with a police pension waiting for me, I've never actually had to spend much time in the cells.""""You know, I didn't do it,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Whatever it was.""""That's good,"" said the policeman.""Excuse me,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Do I get anything to read?""""Does this look like a lending library to you?""""No.""""When I was a young copper, bloke asked me for a book, I went and found him the book I'd been reading. J. T. Edson, it was, or maybe Louis L'Amour. He only went and blocked up his toilet with it, didn't he? Won't catch me doing that again in a hurry.""Then he went out and locked the door, with Fat Charlie on the inside and himself on the outside.The oddest thing, thought Grahame Coats, who was not given to self-inspection, was how normal and chipper and generally good he felt.The captain told them to fasten their safety belts, and mentioned that they would be landing soon on Saint Andrews. Saint Andrews was a small Caribbean island which, on declaring independence in 1962, had elected to demonstrate its freedom from colonial rule in a number of ways, including the creation of its own judiciary and a singular lack of extradition treaties with the rest of the world.The plane landed. Grahame Coats got off and walked across the sunny tarmac dragging his wheeled bag behind him. He produced the appropriate passport - Basil Finnegan's - and had it stamped, collected the rest of his luggage from the carousel, and walked out through an unattended customs hall into the tiny airport and from there into the glorious sunshine. He wore a T-shirt and shorts and sandals and looked like a British Holidaymaker Abroad.His groundskeeper was waiting for him outside the airport, and Grahame Coats sat himself in the back of the black Mercedes and said ""Home, please."" On the road out of Williamstown, the road to his clifftop estate, he stared out at the island with a satisfied and proprietorial smile on his face.It occurred to him that before he left England he had left a woman for dead. He wondered if she was still alive; he rather doubted it. It did not bother him to have killed. It felt instead immensely satisfying, like something he had needed to do to feel complete. He wondered if he would ever get to do it again.He wondered if it would be soon.
AB_ch10	AB	Anansi Boys	10	9560	54792	CHAPTER TENIN WHICH FAT CHARLIE SEES THE WORLD AND MAEVE LIVINGSTONE IS DISSATISFIEDFat Charlie sat on the blanket on the metal bed and waited for something to happen, but it didn't. What felt like several months passed, extremely slowly. He tried to go to sleep but he couldn't remember how.He banged on the door.Someone shouted, ""Shut up!"" but he couldn't tell whether it was an officer or a fellow inmate.He walked around the cell for what, at a conservative estimate, he felt must have been two or three years. Then he sat down and let eternity wash over him. Daylight was visible through the thick glass block at the top of the wall that did duty as a window, by all appearances the same daylight that had been visible when the door was locked behind him that morning.Fat Charlie tried to remember what people did in prison to pass the time, but all he could come up with was keeping secret diaries and hiding things in their bottoms. He had nothing to write on, and felt that a definite measure of how well one was getting on in life was not having to hide things in one's bottom.Nothing happened. Nothing continued to happen. More Nothing. The Return of Nothing. Son of Nothing. Nothing Rides Again. Nothing and Abbott and Costello meet the Wolfman-When the door was unlocked, Fat Charlie nearly cheered.""Right. Exercise yard. You can have a cigarette if you need one.""""I don't smoke.""""Filthy habit anyway.""The exercise yard was an open space in the middle of the police station surrounded by walls on all sides and topped by wire mesh, which Fat Charlie walked around while deciding that, if there was one thing he didn't like being in, it was police custody. Fat Charlie had had no real liking for the police, but until now, he had still managed to cling to a fundamental trust in the natural order of things, a conviction that there was some kind of power - a Victorian might have thought of it as Providence - that ensured that the guilty would be punished while the innocent would be set free. This faith had collapsed in the face of recent events and had been replaced by the suspicion that he would spend the rest of his life pleading his innocence to a variety of implacable judges and tormenters, many of whom would look like Daisy, and that he would in all probability wake up in cell six the following morning to find that he had been transformed into an enormous cockroach. He had definitely been transported to the kind of maleficent universe that transformed people into cockroaches-Something dropped out of the sky above him onto the wire mesh. Fat Charlie looked up. A blackbird stared down at him with lofty disinterest. There was more fluttering, and the blackbird was joined by several sparrows and by something that Fat Charlie thought was probably a thrush.They stared at him; he stared back at them.More birds came.It would have been hard for Fat Charlie to say exactly when the accumulation of birds on the wire mesh moved from interesting to terrifying. It was somewhere in the first hundred or so, anyway. And it was in the way they didn't coo, or caw, or trill, or sing. They simply landed on the wire, and they watched him.""Go away,"" said Fat Charlie.As one bird, they didn't. Instead, they spoke. They said his name.Fat Charlie went over to the door in the corner. He banged on it. He said, ""Excuse me,"" a few times, and then he started shouting, ""Help!""A clunk. The door was opened, and a heavy-lidded member of Her Majesty's constabulary said, ""This had better be good.""Fat Charlie pointed upward. He didn't say anything. He didn't need to. The constabular mouth dropped open peculiarly wide, and it hung there slackly. Fat Charlie's mother would have told the man to shut his mouth or something would fly into it.The mesh sagged under the weight of thousands of birds. Tiny avian eyes stared down, unblinkingly.""Christ on a bike,"" said the policeman, and he ushered Fat Charlie back into the cellblock without saying another word.Maeve Livingstone was in pain. She was sprawled on the floor. She woke, and her hair and face were wet and warm, and then she slept, and when next she woke her hair and face were sticky and cold. She dreamed and woke and dreamed again, woke enough to be conscious of the hurt at the back of her head, and then, because it was easier to sleep, and because when she slept it did not hurt, she allowed sleep to embrace her like a comfortable blanket.In her dreams she was walking through a television studio, looking for Morris. Occasionally she would catch glimpses of him on the monitors. He always looked concerned. She tried to find her way out, but all ways led her back to the studio floor.""I'm so cold,"" she thought, and knew that she was awake once more. The pain, though, had subsided. All things considered, thought Maeve, she felt pretty good.There was something she was upset about, but she was not entirely sure what it was. Perhaps it had been another part of her dream.It was dark, wherever she was. She seemed to be in some kind of broom closet, and she put out her arms to avoid bumping into anything in the darkness. She took a few nervous steps with her arms outstretched and her eyes closed, then she opened her eyes. Now she was in a room she knew. It was an office.Grahame Coats's office.She remembered then. The just-awake grogginess was still there - she wasn't yet thinking clearly, knew she wouldn't be properly all there until she had had her morning cup of coffee - but still, it came to her: Grahame Coats's perfidiousness, his treachery, his criminality, his-Why, she thought, he assaulted me. He hit me. And then she thought, The police. I should call the police.She reached down for the phone on the table and picked it up, or tried to, but the phone seemed very heavy, or slippery, or both, and she was unable to grasp it properly. It felt wrong for her fingers.I must be weaker than I thought, Maeve decided. I had better ask them to send a doctor as well.In the pocket of her jacket was a small silver phone which played ""Greensleeves"" when it rang. She was relieved to find the phone still here, and that she had no problems at all in holding it. She dialed the emergency services. As she waited for someone to answer she wondered why they still called it dialing when there weren't dials on telephones, not since she was much younger, and then after the phones with dials came the trim-phones with buttons on them and a particularly annoying ring. She had, as a teenager, had a boyfriend who could and continually did imitate the breep of a trimphone, an ability that was, Maeve decided, looking back, his only real achievement. She wondered what had happened to him. She wondered how a man who could imitate a trimphone coped in a world in which telephones could and did sound like anything-""We apologize for the delay in placing your call,"" said a mechanical voice. ""Please hold the line.""Meave felt oddly calm, as if nothing bad could ever happen to her again.A man's voice came on the line. ""Hello?"" it said. It sounded extremely efficient.""I need the police,"" said Maeve.""You do not need the police,"" said the voice. ""All crimes will be dealt with by the appropriate and inevitable authorities.""""You know,"" said Maeve, ""I think I may have dialed the wrong number.""""Likewise,"" said the voice, ""all numbers are, ultimately, correct. They are simply numbers and cannot thus be right or wrong.""""That's all very well for you to say,"" said Maeve. ""But I do need to speak to the police. I may also need an ambulance. And I have obviously called a wrong number."" She ended the call. Perhaps, she thought, 999 didn't work from a cell phone. She pulled up her onscreen address book and called her sister's number. The phone rang once, and a familiar voice said. ""Let me clarify: I am not saying that you dialed a wrong number on purpose. What I trust that I am saying is that all numbers are by their nature correct. Well, except for Pi, of course. I can't be doing with Pi. Gives me a headache just thinking about it, going on and on and on and on and on-""Maeve pressed the red button and ended the call. She dialed her bank manager.The voice that answered said, ""But here am I, wittering on about the correctness of numbers, and you're undoubtedly thinking that there's a time and a place for everything-""Click. Called her best friend.""-and right now what we should be discussing is your ultimate disposition. I'm afraid traffic is extremely heavy this afternoon, so if you wouldn't mind waiting where you are for a little while, you will be collected-"" It was a reassuring voice, the voice of a radio vicar in the process of telling you his thought for the day.If Maeve had not felt so placid, she would have panicked then. Instead, she pondered. Seeing that her phone had been - what would they call it, hacked? - then she would simply have to go down to the street and find a police officer and make a formal complaint. Nothing happened when Maeve pressed the button for the lift, so she walked down the stairs, thinking that there was probably never a police officer about when you wanted one anyway, they were always zooming about in those cars, the ones that went neenorneenor. The police, Maeve thought, should be strolling around in pairs telling people the time or waiting at the bottom of drainpipes as burglars with bags of swag over their shoulder make their descent-At the very bottom of the stairs, in the hallway, were two police officers, a man and a woman. They were out of uniform, but they were police all right. There was no mistaking them. The man was stout and red-faced, the woman was small and dark and might, in other circumstances, have been extremely pretty. ""We know she came this far,"" the woman was saying. ""The receptionist remembered her coming in, just before lunchtime. When she got back from lunch, they'd both gone.""""You think they ran off together?"" asked the stout man.""Um, excuse me,"" said Maeve Livingstone, politely.""It's possible. There's got to be some kind of simple explanation. The disappearance of Grahame Coats. The disappearance of Maeve Livingstone. At least we've got Nancy in custody.""""We certainly did not run off together,"" said Maeve, but they ignored her.The two police officers got into the lift and slammed the doors behind them. Maeve watched them judder up and away, toward the top floor.She was still holding her cell phone. It vibrated in her hand now and then began to play ""Greensleeves."" She glanced down at it. Morris's photograph filled the screen. Nervously, she answered the phone. ""Yes?"""" 'Ullo love. How's tricks?""She said, ""Fine thank you."" Then she said, ""Morris?"" And then, ""No, it's not fine. It's all awful, actually.""""Aye,"" said Morris. ""I thought it might be. Still, nothing that can be done about that now. Time to move on.""""Morris? Where are you calling from?""""It's a bit complicated,"" he said. ""I mean, I'm not actually on the phone. Just really wanted to help you along.""""Grahame Coats,"" she said. ""He was a crook.""""Yes, love,"" said Morris. ""But it's time to let all that go. Put it behind you.""""He hit me on the back of the head,"" she told him. ""And he's been stealing our money.""""It's only material things, love,"" said Morris, reassuringly. ""Now you're beyond the vale-""""Morris,"" said Maeve. ""That pestilent little worm attempted to murder your wife. I do think you should try to show a little more concern.""""Don't be like that, love. I'm just trying to explain-""""I have to tell you, Morris, that if you're going to take that kind of attitude, I'll simply deal with this myself. I'm certainly not going to forget about it. It's all right for you, you're dead. You don't have to worry about these things.""""You're dead, too, love.""""That is quite beside the point,"" she said. Then, ""I'm what?"" And then, before he could say anything, Maeve said, ""Morris, I said that he attempted to murder me. Not that he succeeded.""""Erm,"" the late Morris Livingstone sounded lost for words. ""Maeve. Love. I know this may come as a bit of a shock to you, but the truth of the matter is that -""The telephone made a ""plibble"" noise, and the image of an empty battery appeared on the screen.""I'm afraid I didn't get that, Morris,"" she told him. ""I think the telephone battery is going.""""You don't have a phone battery,"" he told her. ""You don't have a phone. All is illusion. I keep trying to tell you, you've now transcended the vale of oojamaflip, and now you're becoming, oh heck, it's like worms and butterflies, love. You know.""""Caterpillars,"" said Maeve. ""I think you mean caterpillars and butterflies.""""Er, that sounds right,"" said Morris's voice over the telephone. ""Caterpillars. That was what I meant. So what do worms turn into, then?""""They don't turn into anything, Morris,"" said Maeve, a little testily. ""They're just worms."" The silver phone emitted a small noise, like an electronic burp, showed the picture of an empty battery again, and turned itself off.Maeve closed it and put it back into her pocket. She walked over to the nearest wall and, experimentally, pushed a finger against it. The wall felt clammy and gelatinous to the touch. She exerted a little more pressure, and her whole hand went into it. Then it went through it.""Oh dear,"" she said, and felt herself, not for the first time in her existence, wishing that she had listened to Morris, who after all, she admitted to herself, by now probably knew rather more about being dead than she did. Ah well, she thought. Being dead is probably just like everything else in life: you pick some of it up as you go along, and you just make up the rest.She walked out the front door, and found herself coming through the wall at the back of the hall, into the building. She tried again, with the same result. Then she walked into the travel agency that occupied the bottom floor of the building, and tried pushing through the wall on the west of the building.She went through it, and came out in the front hall again, entering from the east. It was like being in a TV set and trying to walk off the screen. Topographically speaking, the office building seemed to have become her universe.She went back upstairs to see what the detectives were doing. They were staring at the desk, at the debris that Grahame Coats had left when he was packing.""You know,"" said Maeve helpfully, ""I'm in a room behind the bookcase. I'm in there.""They ignored her.The woman crouched down and rummaged in the bin. ""Bingo,"" she said, and pulled out a man's white shirt, spattered with dried blood. She placed it into a plastic bag. The stout man pulled out his phone.""I want Forensic down here,"" he said.Fat Charlie now found himself viewing his cell as a refuge rather than as a prison. Cells were deep inside the building, for a start, far from the haunts of even the most adventurous birds. And his brother was nowhere to be seen. He no longer minded that nothing ever happened in cell six. Nothing was infinitely preferable to most of the somethings he found himself coming up with. Even a world populated exclusively with castles and cockroaches and people named K was preferable to a world filled with malignant birds that whispered his name in chorus.The door opened.""Don't you knock?"" asked Fat Charlie.""No,"" said the policeman. ""We don't, actually. Your solicitor's finally here.""""Mister Merryman?"" said Fat Charlie, and then he stopped. Leonard Merryman was a rotund gentleman with small gold spectacles, and the man behind the cop most definitely wasn't.""Everything's fine,"" said the man who wasn't his solicitor. ""You can leave us here.""""Buzz when you're done,"" said the policeman, and he closed the door.Spider took Fat Charlie by the hand. He said, ""I'm busting you out of here.""""But I don't want to be busted out of here. I didn't do anything.""""Good reason for getting out.""""But if I leave then I will have done something. I'll be an escaped prisoner.""""You're not a prisoner,"" said Spider, cheerfully. ""You've not been charged with anything yet. You're just helping them with their inquiries. Look, are you hungry?""""A bit.""""What do you want? Tea? Coffee? Hot chocolate?""Hot chocolate sounded extremely good to Fat Charlie. ""I'd love a hot chocolate,"" he said.""Right,"" said Spider. He grabbed Fat Charlie's hand and said, ""Close your eyes.""""Why?""""It makes it easier.""Fat Charlie closed his eyes, although he was not certain what it would make easier. The world stretched and squeezed and Fat Charlie was certain that he was going to be sick. Then the inside of his mind settled down, and he felt a warm breeze touch his face.He opened his eyes.They were in the open air, in a large market square, somewhere that looked extremely un-English.""Where is this?""""I think it's called Skopsie. Town in Italy or somewhere. I started coming here years ago. They do amazing hot chocolate here. Best I've ever had.""They sat down at a small wooden table. It was painted fire-engine red. A waiter approached and said something to them in a language that didn't sound like Italian to Fat Charlie. Spider said ""Dos Chocolatos, dude,"" and the man nodded and went away.""Right,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Now you've got me into even deeper trouble. Now they'll just do a manhunt or something. It'll be in the papers.""""What are they going to do?"" asked Spider with a smile. ""Send you to jail?""""Oh please.""The hot chocolate arrived, and the waiter poured it into small cups. It was roughly the same temperature as molten lava, was halfway between a chocolate soup and a chocolate custard, and it smelled astonishingly good.Spider said, ""Look, we've made rather a mess of this whole family reunion business, haven't we?""""We've made rather a mess of it?"" Fat Charlie managed outrage extremely well. ""I wasn't the one who stole my fiancée. I wasn't the one who got me sacked from work. I wasn't the one who got me arrested -""""No,"" said Spider. ""But you were the one who brought the birds into it, weren't you?""Fat Charlie took a very small initial sip of his hot chocolate. ""Ow. I think I've just burned my mouth."" He looked at his brother and saw his own expression staring back at him: worried, tired, frightened. ""Yes, I was the one who brought the birds into it. So what do we do now?""Spider said, ""They do a really nice sort of noodly-stew thing here, by the way.""""Are you sure we're in Italy?""""Not really.""""Can I ask you a question?""Spider nodded.Fat Charlie tried to think of the best way to put it. ""The bird thing. Where they all turn up and pretend they've escaped from an Alfred Hitchcock film. Do you think it's something that only happens in England?""""Why?""""Because I think those pigeons have noticed us."" He pointed to the far end of the square.The pigeons were not doing the things that pigeons usually do. They were not pecking at sandwich crusts or bobbing along with their heads down hunting for tourist-dropped food. They were standing quite still, and they were staring. A clatter of wings, and they were joined by another hundred birds, most of them landing on the statue of a fat man wearing an enormous hat that dominated the center of the square. Fat Charlie looked at the pigeons, and the pigeons looked back at him. ""So what's the worst that could happen?"" he asked Spider, in an undertone. ""They crap all over us?""""I don't know. But I expect they can do worse than that. Finish your hot chocolate.""""But it's hot.""""And we'll need a couple of bottles of water, won't we? Garçon?""A low susurrus of wings; the clack of more arriving birds; and beneath it all, low, burbling secretive coos.The waiter brought them bottles of water. Spider, who was, Fat Charlie observed, now wearing his black-and-red leather jacket once more, put them into his pockets.""They're only pigeons,"" said Fat Charlie, but even as he said it, he knew the words were inadequate. They were not just pigeons. They were an army. The statue of the fat man had almost vanished from view beneath the gray and purple feathers.""I think I preferred birds before they thought about ganging up on us.""Spider said, ""And they're everywhere."" Then he grabbed Fat Charlie's hand. ""Close your eyes.""The birds rose as one bird then. Fat Charlie closed his eyes.The pigeons came down like the wolf on the fold-.There was silence, and distance, and Fat Charlie thought, I'm in an oven. He opened his eyes and realized that it was true: an oven with red dunes that receded into the distance until they faded into a sky the color of mother-of-pearl.""Desert,"" said Spider. ""Seemed like a good idea. Bird-free zone. Somewhere to finish a conversation. Here."" He handed Fat Charlie a bottle of water.""Thanks.""""So. Would you like to tell me where the birds come from?""Fat Charlie said, ""There's this place. I went there. There were lots of animal-people there. They um. They all knew Dad. One of them was a woman, a sort of bird woman.""Spider looked at him. ""There's this place? That's not exactly very helpful.""""There's a mountainside with caves in it. And then there are these cliffs, and they go down into nothing. It's like the end of the world.""""It's the beginning of the world,"" corrected Spider. ""I've heard of the caves. A girl I knew once told me all about them. Never been there, though. So you met the Bird Woman, and-?""""She offered to make you go away. And, um. Well, I took her up on it.""""That,"" said Spider, with a movie-star smile, ""was really stupid.""""I didn't tell her to hurt you.""""What did you think she was going to do to get rid of me? Write me a stiff letter?""""I don't know. I didn't think. I was upset.""""Great. Well, if she has her way, you'll be upset, and I'll be dead. You could have simply asked me to leave, you know.""""I did!""""Er. What did I say?""""That you liked it in my house and you weren't going anywhere.""Spider drank some of the water. ""So what exactly did you say to her?""Fat Charlie tried to remember. Now he thought about it, it seemed an odd sort of thing to say. ""Just that I was going to give her Anansi's bloodline,"" he said, reluctantly.""You what?""""It was what she asked me to say.""Spider looked incredulous. ""But that's not just me. That's both of us.""Fat Charlie's mouth was suddenly very dry. He hoped it was the desert air, and sipped his bottled water.""Hang on. Why the desert?"" asked Fat Charlie.""No birds. Remember?""""So what are those?"" He pointed. At first they looked tiny, and then you realized that they were simply very high: they were circling, and wobbling on the wing.""Vultures,"" said Spider. ""They don't attack living things.""""Right. And pigeons are scared of people,"" said Fat Charlie. The dots in the sky circled lower, and the birds appeared to grow as they descended.Spider said, ""Point taken."" Then, ""Shit.""They weren't alone. Someone was watching them on a distant dune. A casual observer might have mistaken the figure for a scarecrow.Fat Charlie shouted, ""Go away!"" His voice was swallowed by the sand. ""I take it all back. We don't have a deal! Leave us alone!""A flutter of overcoat on the hot wind, and the dune was now deserted.Fat Charlie said, ""She went away. Who would have thought it was going to be that simple?""Spider touched his shoulder, and pointed. Now the woman in the brown overcoat was standing on the nearest ridge of sand, so close that Fat Charlie could see the glassy blacks of her eyes.The vultures were raggedy black shadows, and then they landed: their naked mauve necks and scalps - featherless because that's so much easier when you're putting your head into rotting carcasses - extended as they stared shortsightedly at the brothers, as if wondering whether to wait until the two men died or if they should do something to hurry the process along.Spider said, ""What else was there in the deal?""""Um?""""Was there anything else? Did she give you something to seal the bargain? Sometimes things like this involve a trade.""The vultures were edging forward, a step at a time, closing their ranks, tightening the circle. There were more black slashes in the sky, growing and wobbling toward them. Spider's hand closed around Fat Charlie's hand.""Close your eyes.""The cold hit Fat Charlie like a punch to the gut. He took a deep breath and felt like someone had iced his lungs. He coughed and coughed while the wind howled like a great beast.He opened his eyes. ""Can I ask where we are this time?""""Antarctica,"" said Spider. He zipped up the front of his leather jacket, and did not seem to mind the cold. ""It's a bit chilly, I'm afraid.""""Don't you have any middle gears? Straight from desert to ice field.""""No birds here,"" said Spider.""Wouldn't it be easier to just to go and sit inside a building that's nice and bird-free? We could have lunch.""Spider said, ""Right. Now you're complaining, just because it's a little bit nippy.""""It's not a little bit nippy. It's fifty below. And anyway, look.""Fat Charlie pointed at the sky. A pale squiggle, like a miniature letter m chalked onto the sky, hung unmoving in the cold air. ""Albatross,"" he said.""Frigate,"" said Spider.""Pardon?""""It's not an albatross. It's a frigate. He probably hasn't even noticed us.""""Possibly not,"" admitted Fat Charlie. ""But they have.""Spider turned, and said something else that sounded a lot like ""frigate."" There may not have been a million penguins waddling and slipping and belly-sliding toward the brothers, but it certainly looked that way. As a general rule, the only things properly terrified by the approach of penguins tend to be small fish, but when the numbers get large enough-Fat Charlie reached out without being told, and he held Spider's hand. He closed his eyes.When he opened them, he was somewhere warmer, although opening his eyes made no difference to what he saw. Everything was the color of night. ""Have I gone blind?""""We're in a disused coal mine,"" said Spider. ""I saw a photo of this place in a magazine a few years back. Unless there are flocks of sightless finches who have evolved to take advantage of the darkness and eat coal chips, we're probably fine.""""That's a joke, isn't it? About the sightless finches?""""More or less.""Fat Charlie sighed, and the sigh echoed through the underground cavern. ""You know,"" he said, ""If you'd just gone away, if you'd left my house when I asked you to, we'd not be in this mess.""""That isn't very helpful.""""It wasn't meant to be. God knows how I'm going to explain all this to Rosie.""Spider cleared his throat. ""I don't think you'll have to worry about that.""""Because-?""""She's broken up with us.""There was a long silence. Then Fat Charlie said, ""Of course she has.""""I made a kind of a sort of a mess of that part of things."" Spider sounded uncomfortable.""But what if I explain it to her? I mean, if I tell her that I wasn't you, that you were pretending to be me -""""I already did. That was when she decided she didn't want to see either of us ever again.""""Me as well?"""" 'Fraid so.""""Look,"" said Spider's voice in the darkness. ""I really never meant to make-. Well, when I came to see you, all I wanted to do was say hello. Not to. Um. I've pretty much completely cocked this all up, haven't I?""""Are you trying to say sorry?""Silence. Then, ""I guess. Maybe.""More silence. Fat Charles said, ""Well, then I'm really sorry I called the Bird Woman to get rid of you."" Not seeing Spider while they were talking made it easier, somehow.""Yeah. Thanks. I just wish I knew how to get rid of her.""""A feather!"" said Fat Charlie.""No, you've lost me.""""You asked if she gave me anything to seal the deal. She did. She gave me a feather.""""Where is it?""Fat Charlie tried to remember. ""I'm not sure. I had it when I woke up in Mrs. Dunwiddy's front room. I didn't have it when I got on the plane. I suppose that Mrs. Dunwiddy must still have it.""The silence that met this was long and dark and unbroken. Fat Charlie began to worry that Spider had gone away, that he had been left abandoned in the darkness under the world. Eventually he said, ""Are you still there?""""Still here.""""That's a relief. If you abandoned me down here I don't know how I'd get out.""""Don't tempt me.""More silence.Fat Charlie said, ""What country are we in?""""Poland, I think. Like I said, I saw a picture of it. Only they had the lights on in the photo.""""You need to see photos of places to go to them?""""I need to know where they are.""It was astounding, thought Fat Charlie, how truly quiet it was in the mine. The place had its own special silence. He started to wonder about silences. Was the silence of the grave different in kind to the silence of, say, outer space?Spider said, ""I remember Mrs. Dunwiddy. She smells of violets."" People have said, ""All hope has fled. We're going to die,"" with more enthusiasm.""That's her,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Small, old as the hills. Thick glasses. I suppose we'll just have to go and get the feather from her. Then we'll give it back to the Bird Woman. She'll call off this nightmare."" Fat Charlie finished the last of the bottled water, carried here from the little square somewhere that wasn't Italy. He screwed the top back onto the bottle and put the empty bottle down into the darkness, wondering if it was littering if no one was ever going to see it. ""So let's hold hands and go and see Mrs. Dunwiddy.""Spider made a noise. The noise was not cocky. It was unsettled and unsure. In the darkness Fat Charlie imagined Spider deflating, like a bullfrog or a week-old balloon. Fat Charlie had wanted to see Spider taken down a peg; he had not wanted to hear him make a noise like a terrified six-year-old. ""Hang on. You're scared of Mrs. Dunwiddy?""""I- I can't go near her.""""Well, if it's any consolation, I was scared of her, too, when I was a kid, and then I met her again at the funeral and she wasn't that bad. Not really. She's just an old lady."" In his mind she lit the black candles once more and sprinkled the herbs into the bowl. ""Maybe a bit spooky. But you'll be okay when you see her.""""She made me go away,"" said Spider. ""I didn't want to go. But I broke this ball in her garden. Big glass thing, like a giant Christmas tree ornament.""""I did that, too. She was pissed.""""I know."" The voice from the dark was small and worried and confused. ""It was the same time. That was when it all started.""""Well. Look. It's not the end of the world. You take me to Florida, I can go and get the feather back from Mrs. Dunwiddy. I'm not scared. You can stay away.""""I can't do that. I can't go to where she is.""""So, what are you trying to say? She's taken out some kind of magical restraining order?""""More or less. Yes."" Then Spider said, ""I miss Rosie. I'm sorry about. You know.""Fat Charlie thought about Rosie. He found it peculiarly hard to remember her face. He thought about not having Rosie's mother as his mother-in-law; about the two silhouettes on the curtains in his bedroom window. He said, ""Don't feel bad about it. Well, you can feel bad about it if you want, because you behaved like a complete bastard. But maybe it was all for the best."" There was a twinge in the general region of Fat Charlie's heart, but he knew that he was speaking the truth. It's easier to say true things in the dark.Spider said, ""You know what doesn't make sense here?""""Everything?""""No. Only one thing. I don't understand why the Bird Woman got involved. It doesn't make sense.""""Dad pissed her off -""""Dad pissed everybody off. She's wrong, though. And if she wanted to kill us, why doesn't she just try to do it?""""I gave her our bloodline.""""So you said. No, something else is going on, and I don't get it."" Silence. Then Spider said, ""Hold my hand.""""Do I need to close my eyes?""""May as well.""""Where are we going? The moon?""""I'm going to take you somewhere safe,"" said Spider.""Oh good,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I like safe. Where?""But then, without even opening his eyes, Fat Charlie knew. The smell was a dead giveaway: unwashed bodies and unflushed toilets, disinfectant, old blankets and apathy.""I bet I would have been just as safe in a luxury hotel room,"" he said aloud, but there was nobody there to hear him. He sat down on the shelflike bed of cell six and wrapped the thin blanket around his shoulders. He might have been there forever.Half an hour later, someone came and led him to the interrogation room.""Hullo,"" said Daisy, with a smile. ""Would you like a cup of tea?""""You might as well not bother,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I've seen the telly. I know how it goes. This is that whole good-cop bad-cop thing, isn't it? You'll give me a cup of tea and some Jaffa cakes, then some big hard-bitten bastard with a hair-trigger temper comes in and shouts at me and pours the tea away and starts eating my Jaffa cakes and then you stop him from physically attacking me, and make him give me my tea and Jaffa cakes back, and in my gratitude I tell you everything you want to know.""""We could skip all that,"" said Daisy, ""and you could just tell us what we want to know. Anyway, we don't have any Jaffa cakes.""""I told you everything I know,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Everything. Grahame Coats gave me a check for two grand and told me to take two weeks off. He said he was pleased I'd brought some irregularities to his attention. Then he asked for my password and waved me good-bye. End of story.""""And you still say you don't know anything about the disappearance of Maeve Livingstone?""""I don't think I ever actually met her properly. Maybe once when she came through the office. We talked on the phone a few times. She'd want to talk to Grahame Coats. I'd have to tell her the check was in the post.""""Was it?""""I don't know. I thought it was. Look, you can't believe I had anything to do with her disappearance.""""No,"" she said, cheerfully, ""I don't.""""Because I honestly don't know what could have - you what?""""I don't think you had anything to do with Maeve Livingstone's disappearance. I also don't believe that you had anything to do with the financial irregularities being perpetrated at the Grahame Coats Agency, although someone seems to have worked very hard to make it look like you did. But it's pretty obvious that the weird accounting practices and the steady syphoning off of money predates your arrival. You've only been there two years.""""About that,"" said Fat Charlie. He realized that his jaw was open. He closed it.Daisy said, ""Look, I know that cops in books and movies are mostly idiots, especially if it's the kind of book with a crime-fighting pensioner or a hard-arsed private eye in it. And I'm really sorry that we don't have any Jaffa cakes. But we're not all completely stupid.""""I didn't say you were,"" said Fat Charlie.""No,"" she said. ""But you were thinking it. You're free to go. With an apology if you'd like one.""""Where did she, um, disappear?"" asked Fat Charlie.""Mrs. Livingstone? Well, the last time anyone saw her, she was accompanying Grahame Coats into his office.""""Ah.""""I meant it about the cup of tea. Would you like one?""""Yes. Very much. Um. I suppose your people already checked out the secret room in his office. The one behind the bookcase?""It is to Daisy's credit that all she said, perfectly calmly, was ""I don't believe they did.""""I don't think we were supposed to know about it,"" said Fat Charlie, ""but I went in once, and the bookshelf was pushed back, and he was inside. I went away again,"" he added. ""I wasn't spying on him or anything.""Daisy said, ""We can pick up some Jaffa cakes on the way.""Fat Charlie wasn't certain that he liked freedom. There was too much open air involved.""Are you okay?"" asked Daisy.""I'm fine.""""You seem a bit twitchy.""""I suppose I am. You'll think this is silly, but I'm a bit - well, I have a thing about birds.""""What, a phobia?""""Sort of.""""Well, that's the common term for an irrational fear of birds.""""What do they call a rational fear of birds, then?"" He nibbled the Jaffa cake.There was silence. Daisy said, ""Well, anyway, there aren't any birds in this car.""She parked the car on the double yellow lines outside the Grahame Coats Agency offices, and they went inside together.Rosie lay in the sun by the pool on the aft deck of a Korean cruise ship with a magazine over her head and her mother beside her, trying to remember why she had ever thought a holiday with her mother would be a good idea.There were no English newspapers on the cruise ship, and Rosie did not miss them. She missed everything else, though. In her mind the cruise was a form of floating purgatory, made bearable only by the islands they visited every day or so. The other passengers would go ashore and shop or parasail or go for rumsodden trips on floating pirate ships. Rosie, on the other hand, would walk, and talk to people.She would see people in pain, see people who looked hungry or miserable, and she wanted to help. Everything seemed very fixable to Rosie. It just needed someone to fix it.Maeve Livingstone had expected death to be a number of things, but irritating had never been one of them. Still, she was irritated. She was tired of being walked through, tired of being ignored, and, most of all, tired of not being able to leave the offices in the Aldwych.""I mean, if I have to haunt anywhere,"" she said to the receptionist, ""why can't I haunt Somerset House, over the road? Lovely buildings, excellent view over the Thames, several architecturally impressive features. Some very nice little restaurants as well. Even if you don't need to eat any longer, it'd be nice for people-watching.""Annie the receptionist, whose job since the vanishment of Grahame Coats had been to answer the phone in a bored voice and say, ""I'm afraid I don't know"" to pretty much any question she was asked, and who, when she was not performing this function, would phone her friends and discuss the mystery in hushed but excitable tones, did not reply to this, as she had not replied to anything Maeve had said to her.The monotony was broken by the arrival of Fat Charlie Nancy, accompanied by the female police officer.Maeve had always rather liked Fat Charlie, even when his function had been to assure her that a check would soon be in the mail, but now she saw things she had never seen before: there were shadows that fluttered about him, always keeping their distance: bad things coming. He looked like a man on the run from something, and it worried her.She followed them into Grahame Coats's office and was delighted to see Fat Charlie head straight over to the bookshelf at the back of the room.""So where's the secret panel?"" asked Daisy.""It's not a panel. It was a door. Behind the bookshelf over here. I don't know. Maybe there's a secret catch or something.""Daisy looked at the bookshelf. ""Did Grahame Coats ever write an autobiography?"" she asked Fat Charlie.""Not that I've ever heard about.""She pushed on the leatherbound copy of My Life by Grahame Coats. It clicked, and the bookshelf swung away from the wall, revealing a locked door behind it.""We'll need a locksmith,"" she said. ""And I don't really think we need you here any longer, Mr Nancy.""""Right,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Well,"" he said, ""It's been, um. Interesting.""And then he said, ""I don't suppose you'd like. To get some food. With me. One day?""""Dim sum,"" she said. ""Sunday lunchtime. We'll go dutch. You'll need to be there when they open the doors at eleven-thirty, or we'll have to queue for ages."" She scribbled down the address of a restaurant and handed it to Fat Charlie. ""Watch out for birds on the way home,"" she said.""I will,"" he said. ""See you Sunday.""The locksmith unfolded a black cloth wallet and took out several slim pieces of metal.""Honestly,"" he said. ""You'd think they'd learn. It's not like good locks are expensive. I mean, you look at that door, lovely piece of work. Solid that is. Take you half a day to get through it with a blow torch. And then they let the whole thing down with a lock that a five-year old could open with a spoon-handle-. There we go-. Easy as falling off the wagon.""He pulled on the door. The door opened and they saw the thing on the floor.""Well, for goodness' sake,"" said Maeve Livingstone. ""That's not me."" She thought she'd have more affection for her body, but she didn't; it reminded her of a dead animal at the side of the road.Soon enough the room was filled with people. Maeve, who had never had much patience for detective dramas, was quickly bored, only taking an interest in what was happening when she felt herself being pulled, unarguably, downstairs and out the front door, as the human remains were taken away in a discreet blue plastic bag.""This is more like it,"" said Maeve Livingstone.She was out.At least she was out of the office in the Aldwych.Obviously, she knew, there were rules. There had to be rules. It's just that she wasn't very sure what they were.She found herself wishing she'd been more religious in life, but she'd never been able to manage it: as a small girl she had been unable to envision a God who disliked anyone enough to sentence them to an eternity of torture in Hell, mostly for not believing in Him properly, and as she grew up her childhood doubts had solidified into a rocky certainty that Life, from birth to grave, was all there was and that everything else was imaginary. It had been a good belief, and it had allowed her to cope, but now it was being severely tested.Honestly, she wasn't sure that even a life spent attending the right sort of church would have prepared her for this. Maeve was rapidly coming to the conclusion that in a well-organized world, Death should be like the kind of all-expenses-included luxury vacation where they give you a folder at the start filled with tickets, discount vouchers, schedules, and several phone numbers to ring if you get into trouble.She didn't walk. She didn't fly. She moved like the wind, like a cold autumn wind that made people shiver as she passed, that stirred the fallen leaves on the pavements.She went where she always went first when she came to London: to Selfridges, the department store in Oxford Street. Maeve had worked in the cosmetics department of Selfridges when she was much younger, between dancing jobs, and she had always made a point of going back whenever she could, and buying expensive makeup, just as she had promised herself she would in the old days.She haunted the makeup department until she was bored, then took a look around home furnishings. She wasn't ever going to get another dining room table, but really, there wasn't any harm in looking-.Then she drifted through the Selfridges home entertainment department, surrounded by television screens of all sizes. Some of the screens were showing the news. The volume was off on each set, but the picture that filled each screen was Grahame Coats. The dislike rose burning hot within her, like molten lava. The picture changed and now she was looking at herself - a clip of her at Morris's side. She recognized it as the ""Give me a fiver and I'll snog you rotten"" sketch from Morris Livingstone, I Presume.She wished she could figure out a way to recharge her phone. Even if the only person she could find was the irritating voice that had sounded like a vicar, she thought, she would even have spoken to him. But mostly she just wanted to talk to Morris. He'd know what to do. This time, she thought, she'd let him talk. This time, she'd listen.""Maeve?""Morris's face was looking out at her from a hundred television screens. She thought for a heartbeat that she was imagining it, then that it was part of the news, but he looked at her with concern, and said her name again, and she knew it was him.""Morris-?""He smiled his famous smile, and every face on every screen focused on her. ""Hullo, love. I was wondering what was taking you so long. Well, it's time for you to come on over.""""Over?""""To the other side. Move beyond the vale. Or possibly the veil. Anyway, that."" And he held out a hundred hands from a hundred screens.She knew that all she needed to do was reach out and take his hand. She surprised herself by saying, ""No, Morris. I don't think so.""A hundred identical faces looked perplexed. ""Maeve, love. You need to put the flesh behind you.""""Well, obviously, dear. And I will. I promise I will. As soon as I'm ready.""""Maeve, you're dead. How much more ready can you be?""She sighed. ""I've still got a few things to sort out at this end.""""For instance?""Maeve pulled herself up to her full height. ""Well,"" she said. ""I was planning on finding that Grahame Coats creature and then doing- well, whatever it is that ghosts do. I could haunt him or something.""Morris sounded slightly incredulous. ""You want to haunt Grahame Coats? Whatever for?""""Because,"" she said, ""I'm not done here."" She set her mouth into a line and raised her chin.Morris Livingstone looked at her from a hundred television screens at the same time, and he shook his head, in a mixture of admiration and exasperation. He had married her because she was her own woman, and had loved her for that reason, but he wished he could, just for once, persuade her of something. Instead, he said, ""Well, I'm not going anywhere, pet. Let us know when you're ready.""And then he began to fade.""Morris. Do you have any idea how I go about finding him?"" she asked. But the image of her husband had vanished completely, and now the televisions were showing the weather.Fat Charlie met Daisy for Sunday Dim Sum, in a dimly lit restaurant in London's tiny Chinatown.""You look nice,"" he said.""Thank you,"" she said. ""I feel miserable. I've been taken off the Grahame Coats case. It's now a full-scale murder investigation. I reckon I was probably lucky to have been with it as long as I was.""""Well,"" he said brightly, ""if you hadn't been part of it you would never have had the fun of arresting me.""""There is that."" She had the grace to look slightly rueful.""Are there any leads?""""Even if there were,"" she said, ""I couldn't possibly tell you about them."" A small cart was trundled over to their table, and Daisy selected several dishes from it. ""There's a theory that Grahame Coats threw himself off the side of a Channel Ferry. That was the last purchase on one of his credit cards - a day ticket to Dieppe.""""Do you think that's likely?""She picked a dumpling up from her plate with her chopsticks, popped it into her mouth.""No,"" she said. ""My guess is that he's gone somewhere with no extradition treaty. Probably Brazil. Killing Maeve Livingstone might have been a spur-of-the-moment thing, but everything else was so meticulous. He had a system in place. Money went into client accounts. Grahame took his fifteen percent off the top and standing orders ensured that a whole lot more came off the bottom. Lot of foreign checks never even made it into the client accounts in the first place. What's remarkable is how long he had kept it up.""Fat Charlie chewed a rice ball with something sweet inside it. He said, ""I think you know where he is.""Daisy stopped chewing her dumpling.""It was something about the way you said he'd gone to Brazil. Like you know he wasn't there.""""That would be police business,"" she said. ""And I'm afraid I cannot possibly comment. How's your brother?""""I don't know. I think he's gone. His room wasn't there when I got home.""""His room?""""His stuff. He'd taken his stuff. And no sign of him since."" Fat Charlie sipped his jasmine tea. ""I hope he's all right.""""You think he wouldn't be?""""Well, he's got the same phobia that I have.""""The birds thing. Right."" Daisy nodded sympathetically. ""And how's the fiancée, and the future mother-in-law?""""Um. I don't think either description is, um, currently operative.""""Ah.""""They've gone away.""""Was this because of the arrest?""""Not as far as I know.""She looked across at him like a sympathetic pixie. ""I'm sorry.""""Well,"" he said. ""Right now I don't have a job, I don't have a love life, and - thanks mostly to your efforts - the neighbors are now all convinced I'm a yardie hit man. Some of them have started crossing the road to avoid me. On the other hand, my newsagent wants me to make sure the bloke who knocked up his daughter is taught a lesson.""""What did you tell him?""""The truth. I don't think he believed me though. He gave me a free bag of cheese-and-onion crisps and a pack of Polo mints, and told me there would be more where that came from once I'd done the job.""""It'll blow over.""Fat Charlie sighed. ""It's mortifying.""""Still,"" she said. ""It's not as if it's the end of the world.""They split the bill, and the waiter gave them two fortune cookies with their change.""What does yours say?"" asked Fat Charlie.""Persistence will pay off,"" she read. ""What about yours?""""It's the same as yours,"" he said. ""Good old persistence."" He crumpled up the fortune into a pea-sized ball and dropped it into his pocket. He walked her down to Leicester Square tube station.""Looks like it's your lucky day,"" said Daisy.""How do you mean?""""No birds around,"" she said.As she said it, Fat Charlie realized it was true. There were no pigeons, no starlings. Not even any sparrows.""But there are always birds in Leicester Square.""""Not today,"" she said. ""Maybe they're busy.""They stopped at the tube, and for one foolish moment Fat Charlie thought that she was going to kiss him good-bye. She didn't. She just smiled and said ""bless,"" and he half-waved at her, an uncertain hand movement that might have been a wave and could as easily have been an involuntary gesture, and then she was down the stairs and out of sight.Fat Charlie walked back across Leicester Square, heading for Piccadilly Circus.He pulled out the fortune cookie slip from his pocket and un-crumpled it. ""Meet you by Eros,"" it said, and next to that was a hasty little drawing of something that looked like large asterisk, and might, conceivably, have been a spider.He scanned the skies and the buildings as he walked, but there were no birds, and that was strange because there were always birds in London. There were always birds everywhere.Spider was sitting beneath the statue, reading the News of the World. He looked up as Fat Charlie approached.""It's not actually Eros, you know,"" said Fat Charlie. ""It's the statue of Christian Charity.""""So why is it naked and holding a bow and arrow? That doesn't seem a particularly charitable or Christian thing to do.""""I'm just telling you what I read,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Where have you been? I was worried about you.""""I'm all right. I've just been avoiding birds, trying to get my head around all this.""""You've noticed there aren't any birds around today?"" said Fat Charlie.""I've noticed. I don't really know what to make of it. But I've been thinking. And you know,"" said Spider, ""there's something wrong with this whole thing.""""Everything, for a start,"" said Fat Charlie.""No. I mean there's something wrong with the Bird Woman trying to hurt us.""""Yup. It's wrong. It's a very, very bad thing to do. Do you want to tell her, or shall I?""""Not wrong like that. Wrong like - well, think about it. I mean, despite the Hitchcock film, birds aren't the best thing to hurt someone with. They may be death-on-wings for insects but they really aren't very good at attacking people. Millions of years of learning that, on the whole, people will probably eat you first. Their first instinct is to leave us alone.""""Not all of them,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Not vultures. Or ravens. But they only turn up on the battlefield, when the fighting's done. Waiting for you to die.""""What?""""I said, except for vultures and ravens. I didn't mean anything-""""No."" Spider concentrated. ""No, it's gone. You made me think of something, and I almost had it. Look, have you got hold of Mrs. Dunwiddy yet?""""I phoned Mrs. Higgler, but there isn't any answer.""""Well go and talk to them.""""It's all very well for you to say that, but I'm skint. Broke. Cleaned out. I can't keep flying back and forwards across the Atlantic. I don't even have a job any longer. I'm -""Spider reached into his black-and-scarlet jacket and pulled out a wallet. He took out a sheaf of notes in an assortment of currencies, pushed them into Fat Charlie's hand. ""Here. This should be enough to get you there and back. Just get the feather.""Fat Charlie said, ""Listen. Has it occurred to you that maybe Dad isn't dead after all?""""What?""""Well, I was thinking. Maybe all this was one of his jokes. It feels like the kind of thing he'd do, doesn't it?""Spider said, ""I don't know. Could be.""Fat Charlie said, ""I'm sure it is. That's the first thing I'm going to do. I'm going to head down to his grave and -""But he said nothing else, because that was when the birds came. They were city birds; sparrows and starlings, pigeons and crows, thousands upon thousands of them, and they wove and wound as they flew like a tapestry, forming a wall of birds coming toward Fat Charlie and Spider down Regent Street. A feathered phalanx huge as the side of a skyscraper, perfectly flat, perfectly impossible, all of it in motion, weaving and fluttering and swooping; Fat Charlie saw it, but it would not fit inside his mind, slipping and twisting and thinning the whole time inside his head. He looked up at it and tried to make sense of what he was seeing.Spider jerked at Fat Charlie's elbow. He shouted ""Run!""Fat Charlie turned to run. Spider was methodically folding his newspaper, putting it down on the bin.""You run too!""""It doesn't want you. Not yet,"" said Spider, and he grinned. It was a grin that had, in its time, persuaded more people than you can imagine to do things they did not want to do; and Fat Charlie really wanted to run. ""Get the feather. Get Dad, too, if you think he's still around. Just go.""Fat Charlie went.The wall of birds swirled and transformed, became a whirlwind of birds heading for the statue of Eros and the man beneath it. Fat Charlie ran into a doorway and watched as the base of the dark tornado slammed into Spider. Fat Charlie imagined he could hear his brother screaming over the deafening whirr of wings. Maybe he could.And then the birds dispersed and the street was empty. The wind teased a handful of feathers along the gray pavement.Fat Charlie stood there and felt sick. If any of the passers-by had noticed what had happened, they had not reacted. Somehow, he was certain that no one had seen it but him.There was a woman standing beneath the statue, near where his brother had been. Her ragged brown coat flapped in the wind. Fat Charlie walked back to her. ""Look,"" he said, ""When I said to make him go away, I meant just to get him out of my life. Not do whatever it is you've done to him.""She looked into his face and said nothing. There is a madness in the eyes of some birds of prey, a ferocity that can be perfectly intimidating. Fat Charlie tried not to be intimidated by it. ""I made a mistake,"" he said. ""I'm willing to pay for it. Take me instead. Bring him back.""She continued to stare. Then she said, ""Do not doubt your turn shall come, CompÉ Anansi's child. In time.""""Why do you want him?""""I don't want him,"" she told him. ""Why would I want him? I had an obligation to another. Now I shall deliver him, and then my obligation shall be done.""The newspaper fluttered, and Fat Charlie was alone.
AB_ch11	AB	Anansi Boys	11	8781	49285	CHAPTER ELEVENIN WHICH ROSIE LEARNS TO SAY NO TO STRANGERS AND FAT CHARLIE ACQUIRES A LIMEFat Charlie looked down at his father's grave. ""Are you in there?"" he said aloud. ""If you are, come out. I need to talk to you.""He walked over to the floral grave marker and looked down. He was not certain what he was expecting - a hand to push up through the soil, perhaps, punching up and grabbing his leg - but nothing of the kind seemed to be about to happen.He had been so certain.Fat Charlie walked back through the Garden of Rest feeling stupid, like a game show contestant who had just made the mistake of betting his million dollars on the Mississippi being a longer river than the Amazon. He should have known. His father was as dead as roadkill, and he had wasted Spider's money on a wild goose chase. By the windmills of Babyland he sat down and wept, and the moldering toys seemed even sadder and lonelier than he remembered.She was waiting for him in the parking lot, leaning against her car, smoking a cigarette. She looked uncomfortable.""Hullo, Mrs. Bustamonte,"" said Fat Charlie.She took one final drag on the cigarette, then dropped it to the asphalt and ground it out beneath the sole of her flat shoe. She was wearing black. She looked tired. ""Hello Charles.""""I think if I'd expected to see anyone here, it would be Mrs. Higgler. Or Mrs. Dunwiddy.""""Callyanne's gone away. Mrs. Dunwiddy sent me. She wants to see you.""It's like the mafia, thought Fat Charlie. A postmenopausal mafia. ""She's going to make me an offer I can't refuse?""""I doubt it. She is not very well.""""Oh.""He climbed into his rental, followed Mrs. Bustamonte's Camry along the Florida streets. He had been so certain about his father. Certain he'd find him alive. Sure that he'd help-.They parked outside Mrs. Dunwiddy's house. Fat Charlie looked at the front yard, at the faded plastic flamingos and the gnomes and the red mirrored gazing ball sitting on a small concrete plinth like an enormous Christmas tree ornament. He walked over to the ball, just like the one he had broken when he was a boy, and saw himself distorted, staring back from it.""What's it for?"" he said.""It's not for anything. She liked it.""Inside the house the smell of violets hung thick and cloying. Fat Charlie's Great-Aunt Alanna had kept a tube of parma violet candies in her handbag, but even as a chunky kid with a sweet tooth, Fat Charlie would eat them only if there wasn't anything else. This house smelled like those sweets had tasted. Fat Charlie hadn't thought of parma violets in twenty years. He wondered if they still made them. He wondered why anyone had ever made them in the first place-.""She's at the end of the hall,"" said Mrs. Bustamonte, and she stopped and she pointed. Fat Charlie went into Mrs. Dunwiddy's bedroom.It was not a big bed, but Mrs. Dunwiddy lay in it like an oversized doll. She wore her glasses, and above them something that Fat Charlie realized was the first nightcap he had ever seen, a yellowing tea-cosy-like affair, trimmed in lace. She was propped up on a mountain of pillows, her mouth open, and she was snoring gently as he walked in.He coughed.Mrs. Dunwiddy jerked her head up, opened her eyes, and stared at him. She pointed her finger to the nightstand beside the bed, and Fat Charlie picked up the glass of water sitting there and passed it to her. She took it with both hands, like a squirrel holding a nut, and she took a long sip before handing it back to him.""My mouth get all dry,"" she said. ""You know how old I am?""""Um."" There was, he decided, no right answer. ""No.""""Hunnert and four.""""That's amazing. You're in such good shape. I mean, that's quite marvelous -""""Shut up, Fat Charlie.""""Sorry.""""Don't say 'sorry' like that neither, like a dog that get tell off for messin' on the kitchen floor. Hold your head up. Look the world in the eye. You hear me?""""Yes. Sorry. I mean, just yes.""She sighed. ""They want to take me to the hospital. I tell them, when you get to be hunnert and four, you earn the right to die in your own bed. I make babies in this bed long time back, and I birth babies in this bed, and damned if I going to die anywhere else. And another thing-"" She stopped talking, closed her eyes, and took a slow, deep breath. Just as Fat Charlie was convinced she had fallen asleep, her eyes opened, and she said, ""Fat Charlie, if someone ever ask if you want to live to be hunnert and four, say no. Everything hurt. Everything. I hurt in places nobody ain't discover yet.""""I'll bear that in mind.""""None of your back talk.""Fat Charlie looked at the little woman in her white wooden bed. ""Shall I say sorry?"" he asked.Mrs. Dunwiddy looked away, guiltily. ""I do you wrong,"" she said. ""Long time ago, I do you wrong.""""I know,"" said Fat Charlie.Mrs. Dunwiddy might have been dying, but she still shot Fat Charlie the kind of look that would have sent children under the age of five screaming for their mothers. ""What you mean, you know?""Fat Charlie said, ""I figured it out. Probably not all of it, but some of it. I'm not stupid.""She examined him coldly through the thick glass of her spectacles, then she said, ""No. You not. True thing, that.""She held out a gnarled hand. ""Give me the water back. That's better."" She sipped her water, dabbing at it with a small, purple tongue. ""Is a good thing you're here today. Tomorrow the whole house be fill with grievin' grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of them tryin' to make me to die in the hospital, makin' up to me so I give them things. They don't know me. I outlive all my own children. Every one of them.""Fat Charlie said, ""Are you going to talk about the bad turn you did to me?""""You should never have break my garden mirror ball.""""I'm sure I shouldn't.""He remembered it, in the way you remember things from childhood, part memory, part memory of the memory: following the tennis ball into Mrs. Dunwiddy's yard, and once he was there, experimentally picking up her mirrored ball to see his face in it, distorted and huge, feeling it tumble to the stone path, watching it smash into a thousand tiny shards of glass. He remembered the strong old fingers that grabbed him by the ear and dragged him out of her yard and into her house-""You sent Spider away,"" he said. ""Didn't you?""Her jaw was set like a mechanical bulldog's. She nodded. ""I did a banishment,"" she said. ""Didn't mean for it to go so. Everybody know a little magic back in those days. We didn't have all them kinda DVDs and cell phones and microwaves, but still, we know a lot regardless. I only wanted to teach you a lesson. You were so full of yourself, all mischief and back talk and vinegar. So I pull Spider out of you, to teach you a lesson.""Fat Charlie heard the words, but they made no sense. ""You pulled him out?""""I break him off from you. All the tricksiness. All the wickedness. All the devilry. All that."" She sighed. ""My mistake. Nobody tell me that if you do magic around a, around people like your daddy's bloodline, it magnify everything. Everything get bigger."" Another sip of the water. ""Your mother never believe it. Not really. But that Spider, he worse than you. Your father never say nothing about it until I make Spider go away. Even then, all he tell me is if you can't fix it you not no son of his.""He wanted to argue with her, to tell her how this was nonsense, that Spider was not a part of him, no more than he, Fat Charlie, was part of the sea or of the darkness. Instead he said, ""Where's the feather?""""What feather you talking about?""""When I came back from that place. The place with the cliffs and the caves. I was holding a feather. What did you do with it?""""I don't remember,"" she said. ""I'm an old woman. I'm a hunnert and four.""Fat Charlie said, ""Where is it?""""I forget.""""Please tell me.""""I ain't got it.""""Who does?""""Callyanne.""""Mrs. Higgler?""She leaned in, confidentially. ""The other two, they're just girls. They're flighty.""""I called Mrs. Higgler before I came out. I stopped at her house before I went to the cemetery. Mrs. Bustamonte says she's gone away.""Mrs. Dunwiddy swayed gently from side to side in the bed, as if she were rocking herself to sleep. She said, ""I not going to be here for much longer. I stop eating solid food after you leave the last time. I done. Only water. Some women say they love your father, but I know him long long before them. Back when I had my looks, he would take me dancing. He come pick me up and whirl me around. He was an old man even then, but he always make a girl feel special. You don't feel-."" She stopped, took another sip of water. Her hands were shaking. Fat Charlie took the empty glass from her. ""Hunnert and four,"" she said. ""And never in my bed in the daytime except for confinements. And now I finish.""""I'm sure you'll reach a hundred and five,"" said Fat Charlie, uneasily.""Don't you say that!"" she said. She looked alarmed. ""Don't! Your family do enough trouble already. Don't you go making things happen.""""I'm not like my dad,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I'm not magic. Spider got all that side of the family, remember?""She did not appear to be listening. She said, ""When we would go dancing, way before the Second World War, your daddy would talk to the bandleader, and plenty times they call him up to sing with them. All the people laugh and cheer. Is so he make things happen. Singing.""""Where is Mrs. Higgler?""""Gone home.""""Her house is empty. Her car isn't there.""""Gone home.""""Er- you mean she's dead?""The old woman on the white sheets wheezed and gasped for breath. She seemed unable to speak any longer. She motioned to him.Fat Charlie said, ""Shall I get help?""She nodded, and continued to gasp and choke and wheeze as he went out to find Mrs. Bustamonte. She was sitting in the kitchen, watching Oprah on a very small countertop television. ""She wants you,"" he said.Mrs. Bustamonte went out. She came back holding the empty water jug. ""What do you say to set her off like that?""""Was she having an attack or something?""Mrs. Bustamonte gave him a look. ""No, Charles. She was laughing at you. She say you make her feel good.""""Oh. She said Mrs. Higgler had gone home. I asked if she meant she was dead.""Mrs. Bustamonte smiled then. ""Saint Andrews,"" she said. ""Callyanne's gone to Saint Andrews."" She refilled the jug in the sink.Fat Charlie said, ""When all this started I thought that it was me against Spider, and you four were on my side. And now Spider's been taken, and it's me against the four of you.""She turned off the water and gazed at him sullenly.""I don't believe anyone anymore,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Mrs. Dunwiddy's probably faking being ill. Probably as soon as I leave here she'll be out of bed and doing the charleston around her bedroom.""""She not eating. She say it makes her feel bad inside. Won't take a thing to fill her belly. Just water.""""Where in Saint Andrews is she?"" asked Fat Charlie.""Just go,"" said Mrs. Bustamonte. ""Your family, you done enough harm here.""Fat Charlie looked as if he was about to say something, and then he didn't, and he left without another word.Mrs. Bustamonte took the jug of water in to Mrs. Dunwiddy, who lay quiet in the bed.""Nancy's son hates us,"" said Mrs. Bustamonte. ""What you tell him anyhow?""Mrs. Dunwiddy said nothing. Mrs. Bustamonte listened, and when she was sure that the older woman was still breathing, she took off Mrs. Dunwiddy's thick spectacles and put them down by the bed, then pulled up the sheet to cover Mrs. Dunwiddy's shoulders.After that, she simply waited for the end.Fat Charlie drove off, not entirely certain where he was going. He had crossed the Atlantic for the third time in two weeks, and the money that Spider had given him was almost tapped out. He was alone in the car, and being alone, he hummed.He passed a clutch of Jamaican restaurants when he noticed a sign in a storefront window: Cut Price to the Islands. He pulled up and went inside.""We at A-One travel are here to serve all your travel needs,"" said the travel agent, in the hushed and apologetic tone of voice doctors normally reserve for telling people that the limb in question is going to have to come off.""Er. Yeah. Thanks. Er. What's the cheapest way to get out to Saint Andrews?""""Will you be going on vacation?""""Not really. I just want to go out for a day. Maybe two days.""""Leaving when?""""This afternoon.""""You are, I take it, joshing with me.""""Not at all.""A computer screen was gazed at, lugubriously. A keyboard was tapped. ""It doesn't look like there's anything out there for less than twelve hundred dollars.""""Oh."" Fat Charlie slumped.More keyboard clicking. The man sniffed. ""That can't be right."" Then he said, ""Hold on."" A phone call. ""Is this rate still valid?"" He jotted down some figures on a scratch pad. He looked up at Fat Charlie. ""If you could go out for a week and stay at the Dolphin Hotel, I could get you a week's vacation for five hundred dollars, with your meals at the hotel thrown in. The flight will only cost you airport tax.""Fat Charlie blinked. ""Is there a catch?""""It's an island tourism promotion. Something to do with the music festival. I didn't think it was still going on. But then, you know what they say. You get what you pay for. And if you want to eat anywhere else it will cost you.""Fat Charlie gave the man five crumpled hundred-dollar bills.Daisy was starting to feel like the kind of cop you only ever see in movies: tough, hard-bitten, and perfectly ready to buck the system; the kind of cop who wants to know whether or not you feel lucky or if you're interested in making his day, and particularly the kind of cop who says ""I'm getting too old for this shit."" She was twenty-six years old, and she wanted to tell people she was too old for this shit. She was quite aware of how ridiculous this was, thank you very much.At this moment, she was standing in Detective Superintendent Camberwell's office and saying, ""Yes, sir. Saint Andrews.""""Went there on my holidays some years back, with the former Mrs. Camberwell. Very pleasant place. Rum cake.""""That sounds like the place, sir. The closed-circuit footage from Gatwick is definitely him. Traveling under the name of Bronstein. Roger Bronstein flies to Miami, changes planes, and takes a connection to Saint Andrews.""""You're sure it's him?""""Sure.""""Well,"" said Camberwell. ""That buggers us good and proper, doesn't it? No extradition treaty.""""There must be something we can do.""""Mm. We can freeze his remaining accounts and grab his assets, and we will, and that'll be as much use to us as a water-soluble umbrella, because he'll have lots of cash sitting in places we can't find it or touch it.""Daisy said, ""But that's cheating.""He looked up at her as if he wasn't certain exactly what he was looking at. ""It's not a playground game of tag. If they kept the rules, they'd be on our side. If he comes back, then we arrest him."" He squashed a little Plasticine man into a Plasticine ball and began to mash it out into a flat sheet, pinching it between finger and thumb. ""In the old days,"" he said, ""they could claim sanctuary in a church. If you stayed in the church the law couldn't touch you. Even if you killed a man. Of course, it limited your social life. Right.""He looked at her as if he expected her to leave now. She said, ""He killed Maeve Livingstone. He's been cheating his clients blind for years.""""And?""""We should be bringing him to justice.""""Don't let it get to you,"" he said.Daisy thought, I'm getting too old for this shit. She kept her mouth shut, and the words simply went round and round inside her head.""Don't let it get to you,"" he repeated. He folded the Plasticine sheet into a rough cube, then squeezed it viciously between finger and thumb. ""I don't let any of it get to me. Think of it as if you were a traffic warden. Grahame Coats is just a car that parked on the double yellow lines but drove off before you were able to give him a ticket. Yes?""""Sure,"" said Daisy. ""Of course. Sorry.""""Right,"" he said.She went back to her desk, went to the Police internal Web site, and examined her options for several hours. Finally, she went home. Carol was sitting in front of Coronation Street, eating a microwavable chicken korma.""I'm taking a break,"" said Daisy. ""I'm going on holiday.""""You don't have any holiday time left,"" pointed out Carol reasonably.""Too bad,"" said Daisy. ""I'm too old for this shit.""""Oh. Where are you going?""""I'm going to catch a crook,"" said Daisy.Fat Charlie liked Caribbeair. They might have been an international airline, but they felt like a local bus company. The flight attendant called him ""darlin' "" and told him jus' to sit anywhere that struck his fancy.He stretched out across three seats and went to sleep. In Fat Charlie's dream he was walking beneath copper skies and the world was silent and still. He was walking toward a bird, vaster than cities, its eyes aflame, its beak agape, and Fat Charlie walked into the beak and down the creature's throat.Then, in the way of dreams, he was in a room, its walls covered with soft feathers and with eyes, round like the eyes of owls, which did not blink.Spider was in the center of the room, his legs and arms extended. He was held up by chains made of bone, like the bones of a chicken's neck, and they ran from each corner of the room, and held him tightly, like a fly in a web.Oh, said Spider. It's you.Yes, said Fat Charlie in his dream.The bone chains pulled and tugged at Spider's flesh, and Fat Charlie could see the pain in his face.Well, said Fat Charlie. I suppose it could be worse.I don't think this is it, said his brother. I think she has plans for me. Plans for us. I just don't know what they are.They're only birds, said Fat Charlie. How bad could it be?Ever heard of Prometheus?Er-Gave fire to man. Was punished by the gods by being chained to a rock. Every day an eagle would come down and tear out his liver.Didn't he ever run out of liver?He grew a new one every day. It's a god thing.There was a pause. The two brothers stared at each other.I'll sort it out, said Fat Charlie. I'll fix it.Just like you fixed the rest of your life, I suppose? Spider grinned, without mirth.I'm sorry.No. I'm sorry. Spider sighed. So look, have you got a plan?A plan?I'll take that as a no. Just do whatever you have to do. Get me out of here.Are you in Hell?I don't know where I am. If it's anywhere, this is the Hell of Birds. You have to get me out.How?You're Dad's son, aren't you? You're my brother. Come up with something. Just get me out of here.Fat Charlie woke, shivering. The flight attendant brought him coffee, and he drank it gratefully. He was awake now, and he had no desire to go back to sleep, so he read the Caribbeair Magazine and learned many useful things about Saint Andrews.He learned that Saint Andrews is not the smallest of the Caribbean Islands, but it tends to be one of the ones that people forget about when they make lists. It was discovered by the Spanish around 1500, an uninhabited volcanic hill teeming with animal life, not to mention a multiplicity of plants. It was said that anything that you planted in Saint Andrews would grow.It belonged to the Spanish, and then to British, then to the Dutch, then to the British again, and then, for a short while after it was made independent in 1962, it belonged to Major F. E. Garrett, who took over the government, broke off diplomatic relations with all other countries except Albania and the Congo, and ruled the country with a rod of iron until his unfortunate death from falling out of bed several years later. He fell out of bed hard enough to break a number of bones, despite the presence in his bedroom of an entire squad of soldiers, who testified that they had all tried, but failed, to break Major Garrett's fall, and despite their best efforts he was dead by the time that he arrived in the island's sole hospital. Since then, Saint Andrews had been ruled by a beneficent and elected local government and was everybody's friend.It had miles of sandy beaches and an extremely small rainforest in the center of the island; it had bananas and sugarcane, a banking system that encouraged foreign investment and offshore corporate banking, and no extradition treaties with anybody at all, except possibly the Congo and Albania.If Saint Andrews was known for anything, it was for its cuisine: the inhabitants claimed to have been jerking chickens before the Jamaicans, currying goats before the Trinidadians, frying flying fish before the Bajans.There were two towns on Saint Andrews: Williamstown, on the southeast side of the island, and Newcastle, on the north. There were street markets in which anything that grew on the island could be bought, and several supermarkets, in which the same foodstuffs could be bought for twice the price. One day Saint Andrews would get a real international airport.It was a matter of opinion whether the deep harbor of Williamstown was a good thing or not. It was indisputable that the deep harbor brought the cruise ships, though, floating islands filled with people, who were changing the economy and nature of Saint Andrews as they were changing the economy of many Caribbean islands. At high season there would be up to half a dozen cruise ships in Williamstown Bay, and thousands of people waiting to disembark, to stretch their legs, to buy things. And the people of Saint Andrews grumbled, but they welcomed the visitors ashore, they sold them things, they fed them until they could eat no more and then they sent them back to their ships-The Caribbeair plane landed with a bump that made Fat Charlie drop his magazine. He put it back into the seat pocket in front of him, walked down the steps and across the tarmac.It was late afternoon.Fat Charlie took a taxi from the airport to his hotel. During the taxi ride, he learned a number of things that had not been mentioned in the Caribbeair magazine. For example, he learned that music, real music, proper music, was country and western music. On Saint Andrews, even the rastas knew it. Johnny Cash? He was a god. Willie Nelson? A demigod.He learned that there was no reason ever to leave Saint Andrews. The taxi driver himself had seen no reason ever to leave Saint Andrews, and he had given it much thought. The island had a cave, and a mountain, and a rainforest. Hotels? It had twenty. Restaurants? Several dozen. It contained a city, three towns, and a scattering of villages. Food? Everything grew here. Oranges. Bananas. Nutmegs. It even, the taxi driver said, had limes.Fat Charlie said ""No!"" at this, mostly in order to feel like he was taking part in the conversation, but the driver appeared to take it as a challenge to his honesty. He slammed on the taxi's brakes, sending the car slewing over to the side of the road, got out of the car, reached over a fence, pulled something from a tree and walked back to the car.""Look at this!"" he said. ""Nobody ever tell you that I is a liar. What it is?""""A lime?"" said Fat Charlie.""Exactly.""The taxi driver lurched the car back into the road. He told Fat Charlie that the Dolphin was an excellent hotel. Did Fat Charlie have family on the island? Did he know anyone here?""Actually,"" said Fat Charlie, ""I'm here looking for someone. For a woman.""The taxi driver thought this was a splendid idea, since Saint Andrews was a perfect place to come if you were looking for a woman. This was, he elaborated, because the women of Saint Andrews were curvier than the women of Jamaica, and less likely to give you grief and heartbreak than the Trinis. In addition, they were more beautiful than the women of Dominica, and they were better cooks than you would find anywhere on Earth. If Fat Charlie was looking for a woman, he had come to the right place.""It's not just any woman. It's a specific woman,"" said Fat Charlie.The taxi driver told Fat Charlie that this was his lucky day, for the taxi driver prided himself on knowing everyone on the island. If you spend your life somewhere, he said, you can do that. He was willing to bet that Fat Charlie did not know by sight all the people in England, and Fat Charlie admitted that this was in fact the case.""She's a friend of the family,"" said Fat Charlie. ""Her name is Mrs. Higgler. Callyanne Higgler. You heard of her?""The taxi driver was quiet for a while. He seemed to be thinking. Then he said that, no, he hadn't ever heard of her. The taxi pulled up in front of the Dolphin Hotel, and Fat Charlie paid him.Fat Charlie went inside. There was a young woman on reception. He showed her his passport and the reservation number. He put the lime down on the reservation desk.""Do you have any luggage?""""No,"" said Fat Charlie, apologetically.""Nothing?""""Nothing. Just this lime.""He filled out several forms, and she gave him a key and directions to his room.Fat Charlie was in the bath when a knock came on the door. He wrapped a towel around his midriff. It was the bellman. ""You left your lime in reception,"" he said, and handed it to Fat Charlie.""Thanks,"" said Fat Charlie. He went back to his bath. Afterward, he went to bed, and dreamed uncomfortable dreams.In his house on the cliff top, Grahame Coats was also having the strangest dreams, dark and unwelcome, if not actually unpleasant. He could not remember them properly when he woke, but he would open his eyes the next morning with a vague impression that he had spent the night stalking smaller creatures through the long grass, despatching them with a blow of his paw, rending their bodies with his teeth.In his dreams, his teeth were weapons of destruction.He woke from the dreams feeling disturbed, with the day slightly charged.And, each morning, a new day would begin and here, only a week away from his old life, Grahame Coats was already experiencing the frustration of the fugitive. He had a swimming pool, true, and cocoa trees, and grapefruit and nutmeg trees; he had a full wine cellar and an empty meat cellar and media center. He had satellite television, a large DVD collection, not to mention art, thousands of dollars' worth of art, all over the walls. He had a cook, who came in each day and cooked his meals, a housekeeper and a groundskeeper (a married couple who came in for a few hours each day). The food was excellent, the climate was - if you liked warm, sunny days - perfect, and none of these things made Grahame Coats as happy as he felt was his due.He had not shaved since leaving England, which had not yet endowed him with a beard, merely given him a thin covering of the kind of facial hair that makes men look shifty. His eyes sat in panda-dark sockets, and the bags beneath his eyes were so dark as to appear to be bruises.He swam in the pool once each day, in the morning, but otherwise avoided the sun; he had not, he told himself, amassed an ill-gotten fortune to lose it to skin cancer. Or to anything else at all.He thought about London too much. In London, each of his favorite restaurants had a maitre d' who called him by name and ensured he left happy. In London there were people who owed him favors, and there was never any difficulty in getting first-night tickets, and for that matter in London there were theaters to have first nights in. He had always thought he would make a fine exile; he was starting to suspect that he had been wrong.Needing someone to blame, he came to the conclusion that the entire affair was Maeve Livingstone's fault. She had led him on. She had attempted to rob him. She was a vixen, a minx, and a hussy. She had deserved everything she had coming to her. She had gotten off easily. Should he be interviewed on television, he could already hear the bruised innocence in his voice as he explained that he had been defending his property and his honor from a dangerous madwoman. Frankly, it was some kind of miracle that he'd made it out of that office alive-.And he had liked being Grahame Coats. He was now, as always while he was on the island, Basil Finnegan, and it irked him. He didn't feel like a Basil. His Basilhood had been hard-won - the original Basil had died as an infant, and had a birth-date close to Grahame's own. One copy of the birth certificate, along with a letter from an imaginary clergyman, later, and Grahame possessed a passport and an identity. He had kept the identity alive - Basil had a solid credit history, Basil traveled to exotic places, Basil had bought a luxury house on Saint Andrews without ever seeing it. But in Grahame's mind, Basil had been working for him, and now the servant had become the master. Basil Finnegan had eaten him alive.""If I stay here,"" said Grahame Coats. ""I shall go mad.""""What you say?"" asked the housekeeper, duster in hand, leaning in at the bedroom door.""Nothing,"" said Grahame Coats.""Sound like you say if you stay in you go mad. You ought to go for a walk. Walking good for you.""Grahame Coats did not go for walks; he had people to do that for him. But, he thought, perhaps Basil Finnegan went for walks. He put on a broad-brimmed hat and exchanged his sandals for walking shoes. He took his cell phone, instructed the groundskeeper to come and get him when he called, and set out from the house on the cliff edge, heading toward the nearest town.It is a small world. You do not have to live in it particularly long to learn that for yourself. There is a theory that, in the whole world, there are only five hundred real people (the cast, as it were; all the rest of the people in the world, the theory suggests, are extras) and what is more, they all know each other. And it's true, or true as far as it goes. In reality the world is made of thousands upon thousands of groups of about five hundred people, all of whom will spend their lives bumping into each other, trying to avoid each other, and discovering each other in the same unlikely teashop in Vancouver. There is an unavoidability to this process. It's not even coincidence. It's just the way the world works, with no regard for individuals or for propriety.So it was that Grahame Coats walked into a small café on the road to Williamstown, in order to purchase a soft drink and to have somewhere to sit while he called his gardener to tell him that he should come and pick him up.He ordered a Fanta and sat down at a table. The place was practically empty: two women, one young, one older, sat in the far corner, drinking coffee and writing postcards.Grahame Coats gazed out, across the road at the beach. It was paradise, he thought. And it might behoove him to get more deeply involved with local politics - perhaps as a sponsor of the arts. He had already made several substantial donations to the island's police force, and it might even become necessary to make sure that-A voice from behind him, thrilled and tentative, said, ""Mister Coats?"" and his heart lurched. The younger of the women sat down beside him. She had the warmest smile.""Fancy running into you here,"" she said. ""You on your holidays too?""""Something like that."" He had no idea who this woman was.""You remember me, don't you? Rosie Noah. I used to go out with Fat, with Charlie Nancy. Yes?""""Hello. Rosie. Yes, of course.""""I'm on a cruise, with my mum. She's still writing postcards home.""Grahame Coats glanced back over his shoulder to the back of the little café, and something resembling a South American mummy in a floral dress glared back at him.""Honestly,"" continued Rosie, ""I'm not really a cruise sort of person. Ten days of going from island to island. It's nice to see a familiar face, isn't it?""""Absatively,"" said Grahame Coats. ""Should I take it that you and our Charles are no longer, well, an item?""""Yes,"" she said. ""I suppose you should. I mean, we're not.""Grahame Coats smiled sympathetically on the outside. He picked up his Fanta and walked with Rosie to the table in the corner. Rosie's mother radiated ill-will just as an old iron radiator can radiate chill into a room, but Grahame Coats was perfectly charming and entirely helpful, and he agreed with her on every point. It was indeed appalling what the cruise companies thought they could get away with these days; it was disgusting how sloppy the administration of the cruise ship had been allowed to get; it was shocking how little there was to do in the islands; and it was, in every respect, outrageous what passengers were expected to put up with: ten days without a bathtub, with only the tiniest of shower facilities. Shocking.Rosie's mother told him about the several quite impressive enmities she had managed to cultivate with certain American passengers whose main crime, as Grahame Coats understood it, was to overload their plates in the buffet line of the Squeak Attack, and to sunbathe in the spot by the aft deck pool that Rosie's mother had decided, on the first day out, was undisputedly hers.Grahame Coats nodded, and made sympathetic noises as the vitriol dripped over him, tching and agreeing and clucking until Rosie's mother was prepared to overlook her dislike both of strangers and people connected in some way to Fat Charlie, and she talked, and she talked, and she talked. Grahame Coats was barely listening. Grahame Coats pondered.It would be unfortunate, Grahame Coats was thinking, if someone was to return to London at this precise point in time and inform the authorities that Grahame Coats had been encountered in Saint Andrews. It was inevitable that he would be noticed one day, but still, the inevitable could, perhaps, be postponed.""Let me,"" said Grahame Coats, ""suggest a solution to at least one of your problems. A little way up the road I have a holiday house. Rather a nice house I like to think. And if there's one thing I have a surplus of, it's baths. Would you care to come back and indulge yourselves?""""No, thanks,"" said Rosie. Had she agreed, it is to be expected that her mother would have pointed out that they were due back at the Williamstown Port for pickup later that afternoon, and would then have chided Rosie for accepting such invitations from virtual strangers. But Rosie said no.""That is extremely kind of you,"" said Rosie's mother. ""We would be delighted.""The gardener pulled up outside soon after in a black Mercedes, and Grahame Coats opened the back door for Rosie and her mother. He assured them he would absatively have them back in the harbor well before the last boat back to their ship.""Where to, Mister Finnegan?"" asked the gardener.""Home,"" he said.""Mister Finnegan?"" asked Rosie.""It's an old family name,"" said Grahame Coats, and he was sure it was. Somebody's family anyway. He closed the back door and went around to the front.Maeve Livingstone was lost. It had started out so well: she had wanted to be at home, in Pontefract, and there was a shimmer and a tremendous wind, and in one ectoplasmic gusting, she was home. She wandered around the house for one last time, then went out into the autumn day. She wanted to see her sister in Rye, and before she could think, there she was in the garden at Rye, watching her sister walking her springer spaniel.It had seemed so easy.That was the point she had decided that she wanted to see Grahame Coats, and that was where it had all gone wrong. She was, momentarily, back in the office in the Aldwych, and then in an empty house in Purley, which she remembered from a small dinner party Grahame Coats had hosted a decade back, and then-Then she was lost. And everywhere she tried to go only made matters worse.She had no idea where she was now. It seemed to be some kind of garden.A brief downpour of rain drenched the place and left her untouched. Now the ground was steaming, and she knew she wasn't in England. It was starting to get dark.She sat down on the ground, and she started to sniffle.Honestly, she told herself. Maeve Livingstone. Pull yourself together. But the sniffling just got worse.""You want a tissue?"" asked someone.Maeve looked up. An elderly gentleman with a green hat and a pencil-thin moustache was offering her a tissue.She nodded. Then she said, ""It's probably not any use, though. I won't be able to touch it.""He smiled sympathetically and passed her the tissue. It didn't fall through her fingers, so she blew her nose with it and dabbed at her eyes. ""Thank you. Sorry about that. It all got a bit much.""""It happens,"" said the man. He looked her up and down, appraisingly. ""What are you? A duppy?""""No,"" she said. ""I don't think so- what's a duppy?""""A ghost,"" he said. With his pencil moustache, he reminded her of Cab Calloway, perhaps, or Don Ameche, one of those stars who aged but never stopped being stars. Whoever the old man was, he was still a star.""Oh. Right. Yes, I'm one of them. Um. You?""""More or less,"" he said. ""I'm dead, anyway.""""Oh. Would you mind if I asked where I was?""""We're in Florida."" he told her. ""In the buryin' ground. It's good you caught me,"" he added. ""I was going for a walk. You want to come along?""""Shouldn't you be in a grave?"" she asked, hesitantly.""I was bored,"" he told her. ""I thought I could do with a walk. And maybe a spot of fishin'.""She hesitated, then nodded. It was nice to have someone to talk to.""You want to hear a story?"" asked the old man.""Not really,"" she admitted.He helped her to her feet, and they walked out of the Garden of Rest.""Fair enough. Then I'll keep it short. Not go too long. You know, I can tell one of these stories so it lasts for weeks. It's all in the details - what you put in, what you don't. I mean, you leave out the weather and what people are wearing, you can skip half the story. I once told a story-""""Look,"" she said, ""if you're going to tell a story, then just tell it to me, all right?"" It was bad enough walking along the side of the road in the gathering dusk. She reminded herself that she wasn't going to be hit by a passing car, but it did nothing to make her feel more at ease.The old man started to talk in a gentle sing-song. ""When I say 'Tiger,' "" he said, ""You got to understand it's not just the stripy cat, the India one. It's just what people call big cats - the pumas and the bobcats and the jaguars and all of them. You got that?""""Certainly.""""Good. So- a long time ago,"" he began, ""Tiger had the stories. All the stories there ever were was Tiger stories, all the songs were Tiger songs, and I'd say that all the jokes were Tiger jokes, but there weren't no jokes told back in the Tiger days. In Tiger stories all that matters is how strong your teeth are, how you hunt and how you kill. Ain't no gentleness in Tiger stories, no tricksiness, and no peace.""Maeve tried to imagine what kind of stories a big cat might tell. ""So they were violent?""""Sometimes. But mostly what they was, was bad. When all the stories and the songs were Tiger's, that was a bad time for everyone. People take on the shapes of the songs and the stories that surround them, especially if they don't have their own song. And in Tiger times all the songs were dark. They began in tears, and they'd end in blood, and they were the only stories that the people of this world knew.""Then Anansi comes along. Now, I guess you know all about Anansi-""""I don't think so,"" said Maeve.""Well, if I started to tell you how clever and how handsome and how charming and how cunning Anansi was, I could start today and not finish until next Thursday,"" began the old man.""Then don't,"" said Maeve. ""We'll take it as said. And what did this Anansi do?""""Well, Anansi won the stories - won them? No. He earned them. He took them from Tiger, and made it so Tiger couldn't enter the real world no more. Not in the flesh. The stories people told became Anansi stories. This was, what, ten, fifteen thousand years back.""Now, Anansi stories, they have wit and trickery and wisdom. Now, all over the world, all of the people they aren't just thinking of hunting and being hunted anymore. Now they're starting to think their way out of problems - sometimes thinking their way into worse problems. They still need to keep their bellies full, but now they're trying to figure out how to do it without working - and that's the point where people start using their heads. Some people think the first tools were weapons, but that's all upside down. First of all, people figure out the tools. It's the crutch before the club, every time. Because now people are telling Anansi stories, and they're starting to think about how to get kissed, how to get something for nothing by being smarter or funnier. That's when they start to make the world.""""It's just a folk story,"" she said. ""People made up the stories in the first place.""""Does that change things?"" asked the old man. ""Maybe Anansi's just some guy from a story, made up back in Africa in the dawn days of the world by some boy with blackfly on his leg, pushing his crutch in the dirt, making up some goofy story about a man made of tar. Does that change anything? People respond to the stories. They tell them themselves. The stories spread, and as people tell them, the stories change the tellers. Because now the folk who never had any thought in their head but how to run from lions and keep far enough away from rivers that the crocodiles don't get an easy meal, now they're starting to dream about a whole new place to live. The world may be the same, but the wallpaper's changed. Yes? People still have the same story, the one where they get born and they do stuff and they die, but now the story means something different to what it meant before.""""You're telling me that before the Anansi stories the world was savage and bad?""""Yeah. Pretty much.""She digested this. ""Well,"" she said cheerily, ""it's certainly a good thing that the stories are now Anansi's.""The old man nodded.And then she said, ""Doesn't Tiger want them back?""He nodded. ""He's wanted them back for ten thousand years.""""But he won't get them, will he?""The old man said nothing. He stared into the distance. Then he shrugged. ""Be a bad thing if he did.""""What about Anansi?""""Anansi's dead,"" said the old man. ""And there ain't a lot a duppy can do.""""As a duppy myself,"" she said, ""I resent that.""""Well,"" said the old man, ""Duppies can't touch the living. Remember?""She pondered this a moment. ""So whatcan I touch?"" she asked.The look that flickered across his elderly face was both wily and wicked. ""Well,"" he said. ""You could touch me.""""I'll have you know,"" she told him, pointedly, ""that I'm a married woman.""His smile only grew wider. It was a sweet smile and a gentle one, as heartwarming as it was dangerous. ""Generally speaking, that kind of contract terminates in a till death us do part.""Maeve was unimpressed.""Thing is,"" he told her, ""you're an immaterial girl. You can touch immaterial things. Like me. I mean, if you want, we could go dancing. There's a place just down the street here. Won't nobody notice a couple of duppies on their dance floor.""Maeve thought about it. It had been a long time since she had gone dancing. ""Are you a good dancer?"" she asked.""I've never had any complaints,"" said the old man.""I want to find a man - a living man - called Grahame Coats,"" she said. ""Can you help me find him?""""I can certainly steer you in the right direction,"" he said. ""So, are you dancing?""A smile crept about the edges of her lips. ""You asking?"" she said.The chains that had kept Spider captive fell away. The pain, which had been searing and continuous like a bad toothache that occupied his entire body, began to pass.Spider took a step forward.In front of him was what appeared to be a rip in the sky, and he moved toward it.Ahead of him he could see an island. He could see a small mountain in the center of the island. He could see a pure blue sky, and swaying palm trees, a white gull high in the sky. But even as he saw it the world seemed to be receding. It was as if he were looking at it through the wrong end of a telescope. It shrank and slipped from him, and the more he ran toward it the further away it seemed to get.The island was a reflection in a puddle of water, and then it was nothing at all.He was in a cave. The edges of things were crisp - crisper and sharper than anywhere that Spider had ever been before. This was a different kind of place.She was standing in the mouth of the cave, between him and the open air. He knew her. She had stared into his face in a Greek restaurant in South London, and birds had come from her mouth.""You know,"" said Spider, ""I have to say, you've got the strangest ideas about hospitality. You come to my world, I'd make you dinner, open a bottle of wine, put on some soft music, give you an evening you would never forget.""Her face was impassive; carved from black rock it was. The wind tugged at the edges of her old brown coat. She spoke then, her voice high and lonely as the call of a distant gull.""I took you,"" she said. ""Now, you will call him.""""Call him? Call who?""""You will bleat,"" she said. ""You will whimper. Your fear will excite him.""""Spider does not bleat,"" he said. He was not certain this was true.Eyes as black and as shiny as chips of obsidian stared back into his. They were eyes like black holes, letting nothing out, not even information.""If you kill me,"" said Spider, ""my curse will be upon you."" He wondered if he actually had a curse. He probably did; and if he didn't, he was sure that he could fake it.""It will not be I that kills you,"" she said. She raised her hand, and it was not a hand but a raptor's talon. She raked her talon down his face, down his chest, her cruel claws sinking into his flesh, tearing his skin.It did not hurt, although Spider knew that it would hurt soon enough.Beads of blood crimsoned his chest and dripped down his face. His eyes stung. His blood touched his lips. He could taste it and smell the iron scent of it.""Now,"" she said in the cries of distant birds. ""Now your death begins.""Spider said, ""We're both reasonable entities. Let me present you with a perhaps rather more feasible alternative scenario that might conceivably have benefits for both of us."" He said it with an easy smile. He said it convincingly.""You talk too much,"" she said, and shook her head. ""No more talking.""She reached into his mouth with her sharp talons, and with one wrenching movement she tore out his tongue.""There,"" she said. And then she seemed to take pity on him, for she touched Spider's face in a way that was almost kindly, and she said, ""Sleep.""He slept.Rosie's mother, now bathed, reappeared refreshed, invigorated and positively glowing.""Before I give you both a ride into Williamstown, can I give you a hasty guided tour of the house?"" asked Grahame Coats.""We do have to get back to the ship, thanks all the same,"" said Rosie, who had not been able to convince herself that she wanted a bath in Grahame Coats's house.Her mother checked her watch. ""We have ninety minutes,"" she said. ""It won't take more than fifteen minutes to get back to the harbor. Don't be ungracious, Rosie. We would love to see your house.""So Grahame Coats showed them the sitting room, the study, the library, the television room, the dining room, the kitchen and the swimming pool. He opened a door beneath the kitchen stairs that looked as if it would lead to a broom cupboard, and walked his guests down the wooden steps into the rock-walled wine cellar. He showed them the wine, most of which had come with the house when he had bought it. He walked them to the far end of the wine cellar to the bare room that had, back in the days before refrigeration, been a meat storage locker. It was always chilly in the meat locker, where heavy chains came down from the ceiling, the empty hooks on the ends showing where once whole carcasses had hung long before. Grahame Coats held the heavy iron door open politely while both the women walked inside.""You know,"" he said, helpfully, ""I've just realized. The light switch is back where we came in. Hold on."" And then he slammed the door behind the women, and he rammed closed the bolts.He picked out a dusty-looking bottle of1995 Chablis Premier Cru from a wine rack.He went upstairs with a swing in his step and let his three employees know that he would be giving them the week off.It seemed to him, as he walked up the stairs to his study, as if something were padding soundlessly behind him, but when he turned there was nothing there. Oddly, he found this comforting. He found a corkscrew, opened the bottle and poured himself a pale glass of wine. He drank it and, although he had never previously had much time for red wines, he found himself wishing that what he was drinking was richer and darker. It should be, he thought, the color of blood.As he finished his second glass of Chablis, he realized that he had been blaming the wrong person for his plight. Maeve Livingstone was, he saw it now, merely a dupe. No, the person to blame, obviously and undeniably, was Fat Charlie. Without his meddling, without his criminal trespass into Grahame Coats's office computer systems, Grahame Coats wouldn't be here, an exile, like a blond Napoleon on a perfect, sunny Elba. He wouldn't be in the unfortunate predicament of having two women imprisoned in his meat locker. If Fat Charlie was here, he thought, I would tear out his throat with my teeth, and the thought shocked him even as it excited him. You didn't want to screw with Grahame Coats.Evening came, and Grahame Coats watched the Squeak Attack from his window as it drifted past his house on the cliff and off into the sunset. He wondered how long it would take them to notice that two passengers were missing. He even waved.
AB_ch12	AB	Anansi Boys	12	7090	39438	CHAPTER TWELVEIN WHICH FAT CHARLIE DOES SEVERAL THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIMEThe Dolphin Hotel had a concierge. He was young and bespectacled, and he was reading a paperback novel with a rose and a gun on the cover.""I'm trying to find someone,"" said Fat Charlie. ""On the island.""""Who?""""A lady named Callyanne Higgler. She's here from Florida. She's an old friend of my family.""The young man closed his book thoughtfully, then he looked at Fat Charlie through narrowed eyes. When people do this in paperback books it gives an immediate impression of dangerous alertness, but in reality it just made the young man look like he was trying not to fall asleep. He said, ""Are you the man with the lime?""""What?""""The man with the lime?""""Yes, I suppose I am.""""Lemme see it, nuh?""""My lime?""The young man nodded, gravely.""No, you can't. It's back in my room.""""But you are the man with the lime.""""Can you help me find Mrs. Higgler? Are there any Higglers on the island? Do you have a phone book I could look at? I was hoping for a phone book in my bedroom.""""It's a kinda common name, you know?"" said the young man. ""The phone book not going to help.""""How common could it be?""""Well,"" said the young man, ""For example, I'm Benjamin Higgler. She over there, on reception, she name Amerila Higgler.""""Oh. Right. Lots of Higglers on the island. I see.""""She on the island for the music festival?""""What?""""It going on all this week."" He handed Fat Charlie a leaflet, informing him that Willie Nelson (canceled) would be headlining the St. Andrews Music Festival.""Why'd he cancel?""""Same reason Garth Brooks cancel. Nobody tell them it was happening in the first place.""""I don't think she's going to the music festival. I really need to track her down. She's got something I'm looking for. Look, if you were me, how would you go about looking for her?""Benjamin Higgler reached into a desk drawer and pulled out a map of the island. ""We're here, just south of Williamstown-"" he began, making a felt pen mark on the paper. From there, he began marking out a plan of campaign for Fat Charlie: he divided the island into segments that could easily be covered in a day by a man on a bicycle, marked out each rum shop and café with small crosses. He put a circle beside each tourist attraction.Then he rented Fat Charlie a bicycle.Fat Charlie pedaled off to the south.There were information conduits on Saint Andrews that Fat Charlie, who, on some level believed that coconut palms and cellular telephones ought to be mutually exclusive, had not expected. It did not seem to make any difference who he talked to: old men playing draughts in the shade; women with breasts like watermelons and buttocks like armchairs and laughter like mockingbirds; a sensible young lady in the tourist office; a bearded rasta with a green, red, and yellow - colored knit cap and what appeared to be a woollen miniskirt: they all had the same response.""You the one with the lime?""""I suppose so.""""Show us your lime.""""It's back at the hotel. Look, I'm trying to find Callyanne Higgler. She's about sixty. American. Big mug of coffee in her hand.""""Never heard of her.""Bicycling around the island, Fat Charlie soon discovered, had its dangers. The chief mode of transportation on the island was the minibus: unlicensed, unsafe, always overfilled, the minibuses hurtled around the island, tooting and squealing their brakes, slamming around corners on two wheels whilst relying on the weight of their passengers to ensure they never tipped over. Fat Charlie would have been killed a dozen times on his first morning out were it not for the low thud of drum and bass being played over each bus's sound system: he could feel them in the pit of his stomach even before he heard their engines, and he had plenty of time to wheel the bicycle over to the side of the road.While none of the people he spoke to were exactly what you could call helpful, they were still all extremely friendly. Fat Charlie stopped several times on his day's expedition to the south and refilled his water bottle: he stopped at cafés and at private houses. Everyone was so pleased to see him, even if they didn't know anything about Mrs. Higgler. He got back to the Dolphin Hotel in time for dinner.On the following day he went north. On his way back to Williamstown, in the late afternoon, he stopped on a cliff top, dismounted, and walked his bike down to the entry gate of a luxurious house that sat on its own, overlooking the bay. He pressed the speakerphone button and said hello, but no one replied. A large black car sat in the driveway. Fat Charlie wondered if perhaps the place was deserted, but a curtain twitched in an upper room.He pressed the button again. ""Hullo,"" he said. ""Just wanted to see if I could fill my water bottle here.""There was no reply. Perhaps he had only imagined that there was someone at the window. He seemed extremely prone to imagining things here: he started to fancy that he was being watched, not by someone in the house, but by someone or something in the bushes that bordered the road. ""Sorry to have bothered you,"" he said into the speaker, and clambered back onto his bike. It was downhill from here all the way to Williamstown. He was sure that he'd pass a café or two on the way, or another house, a friendly one.He was on his way down the road - the cliffs had become a steepish hill down to the sea - when a black car came up behind him and accelerated forward with a roar. Too late, Fat Charlie realized that the driver had not seen him, for there was a long scrape of car against the bike's handlebars, and Fat Charlie found himself tumbling, with the bike, down the hill. The black car drove on.Fat Charlie picked himself up halfway down the hill. ""That could have been nasty,"" he said aloud. The handlebars were twisted. He hauled his bike back up the hill and onto the road. A low bass rumble alerted him to the approach of a minibus, and he waved it down.""Can I put my bike in the back?""""No room,"" said the driver, but he produced several bungee cords from beneath his seat, and used them to fasten the bike onto the roof of the bus. Then he grinned. ""You must be the Englishman with the lime.""""I don't have it on me. It's back at the hotel.""Fat Charlie squeezed onto the bus, where the booming bass resolved itself, extremely improbably, into Deep Purple's ""Smoke on the Water."" Fat Charlie squeezed in next to a large woman with a chicken on her lap. Behind them two white girls chattered about the parties they had attended the previous night and the shortcomings of the temporary boyfriends they had accumulated during their holiday.Fat Charlie noticed the black car - a Mercedes - as it came back up the road. It had a long scratch along one side. He felt guilty, hoping his bike hadn't scraped the paintwork too badly. The windows were tinted so dark that the car might have been driving itself-Then one of the white girls tapped Fat Charlie on the shoulder and asked him if he knew of any good parties on the island that night, and when he said he didn't, started telling him about one that she'd been to in a cave two nights before, where there was a swimming pool and a sound system and lights and everyfink, and so Fat Charlie completely failed to notice that the black Mercedes was now following the minibus into Williamstown, and that it only went on its way once Fat Charlie had retrieved his bike from the roof of the minibus (""next time, you should bring the lime"") and carried the bike into the hotel lobby.Only then did the car return to the house on the cliff top.Benjamin the concierge examined the bike and told Fat Charlie not to worry, and they'd have it all fixed and good as new by tomorrow.Fat Charlie went back to his hotel room, the color of underwater, where his lime sat, like a small green Buddha, on the countertop.""You're no help,"" he told the lime. This was unfair. It was only a lime; there was nothing special about it at all. It was doing the best it could.Stories are webs, interconnected strand to strand, and you follow each story to the center, because the center is the end. Each person is a strand of story.Daisy, for example.Daisy could not have lasted as long as she had in the police force without having a sensible side to her nature, which was mostly all anybody saw. She respected laws, and she respected rules. She understood that many of these rules are perfectly arbitrary - decisions about where one could park, for example, or what hours shops were permitted to open - but that even these rules helped the big picture. They kept society safe. They kept things secure.Her flatmate, Carol, thought she'd gone mad.""You can't just leave and say you're going on holiday. It doesn't work like that. You're not on a TV cop show, you know. You can't just zoom all over the world to follow up a lead.""""Well, then, in that case I'm not,"" Daisy had retorted untruthfully. ""I'm just going on holiday.""She said it so convincingly that the sensible cop who lived at the back of her head was shocked into silence and then began to explain to her exactly what she was doing wrong, beginning with pointing out that she was about to go off on an entirely unauthorized leave - tantamount, muttered the sensible cop, to neglect of duty - and moving on from there.It explained it on the way to the airport, and all across the Atlantic. It pointed out that even if she managed to avoid a permanent black mark in her Personal File, let alone being thrown out of the police force altogether, even if she did find Grahame Coats, there was nothing she could do once she found him. Her Majesty's constabulary look unkindly on kidnapping criminals in foreign countries, let alone arresting them, and she rather doubted she would be able to persuade him to return to the UK willingly.It was only when Daisy got off the little plane from Jamaica and tasted the air - earthy, spicy, wet, almost sweet - of Saint Andrews that the sensible cop stopped pointing out the sheer ill-considered madness of what she was doing. That was because it was drowned out by another voice. ""Evildoers beware!"" it sang. "" Beware! Take care! Evildoers everywhere!"" and Daisy was marching to its beat. Grahame Coats had killed a woman in his office in the Aldwych, and he had walked out of there scot-free. He had done it practically under Daisy's nose.She shook her head, collected her bag, brightly informed the immigration officer that she was here on her holidays, and went out to the taxi rank.""I want a hotel that's not too expensive, but isn't icky, please,"" she said to the driver.""I got just the place for you darlin',"" he said. ""Hop in.""Spider opened his eyes and discovered that he was staked-out, face down. His arms were tied to a large stake pounded into the earth in front of him. He could not move his legs or twist his neck enough to see behind him, but he was willing to bet that they were similarly hobbled. The movement, as he tried to lift himself out of the dirt, to look behind him, caused his scratches to burn.He opened his mouth, and dark blood drooled onto the dust, wetting it.He heard a sound and twisted his head as much as he could. A white woman was looking down at him curiously.""Are you all right? Silly question. Just look at the state of you. I suppose you're another duppy. Do I have that right?""Spider thought about it. He didn't think he was a duppy. He shook his head.""If you are, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Apparently, I'm a duppy myself. I hadn't heard the term before, but I met a delightful old gentleman on the way here who told me all about it. Let me see if I can be of any assistance.""She crouched down next to him and reached out to help loosen his bonds.Her hand slipped through him. He could feel her fingers, like strands of fog, brushing his skin.""I'm afraid I don't seem able actually to touch you,"" she said. ""Still, that means that you're not dead yet. So cheer up.""Spider hoped this odd ghost-woman would go away soon. He couldn't think straight.""Anyway, once I had everything sorted out, I resolved to remain walking the Earth until I take vengeance on my killer. I explained it to Morris - he was on a television screen in Selfridges - and he said he rather thought I was missing the entire point of having moved beyond the flesh, but I ask you, if they expect me to turn the other cheek they have several other thinks coming. There are a number of precedents. And I'm sure I can do a Banquo-at-the-Feast thing, given the opportunity. Do you talk?""Spider shook his head, and blood dripped from his forehead into his eyes. It stung. Spider wondered how long it would take him to grow a new tongue. Prometheus had managed to grow a new liver on a daily basis, and Spider was pretty sure that a liver had to be a lot more work than a tongue. Livers did chemical reactions - bilirubin, urea, enzymes, all that. They broke down alcohol, and that had to be a lot of work on its own. All tongues did was talk. Well, that and lick, of course-""I can't keep yattering on,"" said the yellow-haired ghost-lady. ""I've got a long way to go, I think."" She began to walk away, and she faded as she walked. Spider raised his head and watched her slip from one reality to another, like a photograph fading in the sunlight. He tried to call her back, but all the noises he could make were muffled, incoherent. Tongueless.Somewhere in the distance, he heard the cry of a bird.Spider tested his bonds. They held.He found himself thinking, once again, of Rosie's story of the raven who saved the man from the mountain lion. It itched in his head, worse than the claw tracks on his face and chest. Concentrate. The man lay on the ground, reading or sunbathing. The raven cawed in the tree. There was a big cat in the undergrowth-And then the story reshaped itself, and he had it. Nothing had changed. It was all a matter of how you looked at the ingredients.What if, he thought, the bird wasn't calling to warn the man that there was a big cat stalking him? What if it was calling to tell the mountain lion that there was a man on the ground - dead or asleep or dying. That all the big cat had to do was finish the man off. And then the raven would feast on what it left-Spider opened his mouth to moan, and blood ran from his mouth and puddled on the powdery clay.Reality thinned. Time passed, in that place.Spider, tongueless and furious, raised his head and twisted it to look at the ghost birds that flew around him, screaming.He wondered where he was. This was not the Bird Woman's copper-colored universe, nor her cave, but neither was it the place he had previously tended to think of as the real world. It was closer to the real world, though, close enough that he could almost taste it, or would have tasted it if he could taste anything in his mouth but the iron tang of the blood; close enough that, if he were not staked out on the ground, he could have touched it.If he had not been perfectly certain of his own sanity, certain to a degree that normally is only found in people who have concluded that they're definitely Julius Caesar and have been sent to save the world, he might have thought that he was going mad. First he saw a blonde woman who claimed to be a duppy, and now he heard voices. Well, he heard one voice anyway. Rosie's.She was saying, ""I dunno. I thought it would be a holiday, but seeing those kids, without anything, it breaks your heart. There's so much they need."" And then, while Spider was trying to assess the significance of this, she said, ""I wonder how much longer she's going to be in the bath. Good thing you've got plenty of hot water here.""Spider wondered if Rosie's words were meant to be important, whether they held the key to escaping from his predicament. He doubted it. Still, he listened harder, wondering whether the wind would carry any more words between the worlds. Apart from the crash of the waves on breakers behind and far below him, he heard nothing, only silence. But a specific kind of silence. There are, as Fat Charlie once imagined, many kinds of silences. Graves have their own silence, space has its silence, mountaintops have theirs. This was a hunting silence. It was a stalking silence. In this silence something moved on velvet-soft pads, with muscles like steel springs coiled beneath soft fur; something the color of shadows in the long grass; something that would ensure that you heard nothing it did not wish you to hear. It was a silence that was moving from side to side in front of him, slowly and relentlessly, and with every arc it was getting closer.Spider heard that in the silence, and the hairs on the back of his neck stiffened. He spat blood onto the dust by his face, and he waited.In his house on the cliff top, Grahame Coats paced back and forth. He walked from his bedroom to the study, then down the stairs to the kitchen and back up to the library and from there back to his bedroom again. He was angry with himself: how could he have been so stupid as to assume that Rosie's visit was a coincidence?He had realized it when the buzzer had sounded and he had looked into the closed-circuit TV screen at Fat Charlie's inane face. There was no mistaking it. It was a conspiracy.He had imitated the action of a tiger, and climbed into the car, certain of an easy hit-and-run: if they found a mangled bicycle rider, people would blame it on a minibus. Unfortunately, he had not counted on Fat Charlie's cycling so close to the road's drop-off: Grahame Coats had been unwilling to push his car any closer to the edge of the road, and now he was regretting it. No, Fat Charlie had sent in the women in the meat locker; they were his spies. They had infiltrated Grahame Coats's house. He was lucky that he had tumbled their scheme. He had known there was something wrong about them.As he thought of the women, he realized that he had not fed them yet. He ought to give them something to eat. And a bucket. They would probably need a bucket after twenty-four hours. Nobody could say that he was an animal.He had bought a handgun in Williamstown, the previous week. You could buy guns pretty easily on Saint Andrews, it was that sort of island. Most people didn't bother with buying guns though, it was that sort of island too. He took the gun from his bedside drawer and went down to the kitchen. He took a plastic bucket from under the sink, tossed several tomatoes, a raw yam, a half-eaten lump of cheddar cheese, and a carton of orange juice into it. Then, pleased with himself for thinking of it, he fetched a toilet roll.He went down to the wine cellar. There was no noise from inside the meat locker.""I've got a gun,"" he said. ""And I'm not afraid to use it. I'm going to open the door now. Please go over to the far wall, turn around, and put your hands against it. I've brought food. Cooperate and you will both be released unharmed. Cooperate and nobody gets hurt. That means,"" he said, delighted to find himself able to deploy an entire battalion of clichés hitherto off-limits, ""no funny business.""He turned on the lights inside the room, then pulled the bolts. The walls of the room were rock and brick. Rusting chains hung from hooks in the ceiling.They were against the far wall. Rosie looked at the rock. Her mother stared over her shoulder at him like a trapped rat, furious and filled with hate.Grahame Coats put down the bucket; he did not put down the gun. ""Lovely grub,"" he said. ""And, better late than never, a bucket. I see you've been using the corner. There's toilet paper, too. Don't ever say I didn't do anything for you.""""You're going to kill us,"" said Rosie. ""Aren't you?""""Don't antagonize him, you stupid girl,"" spat her mother. Then, assuming a smile of sorts, she said, ""We're grateful for the food.""""Of course I'm not going to kill you,"" said Grahame Coats. It was only as he heard the words coming out of his mouth that he admitted to himself that, yes, of course he was going to have to kill them. What other option did he have? ""You didn't tell me that Fat Charlie sent you here.""Rosie said, ""We came on a cruise ship. This evening we're meant to be in Barbados for the fish fry. Fat Charlie's in England. I don't even think he knows where we've gone. I didn't tell him.""""It doesn't matter what you say,"" said Grahame Coats. ""I've got the gun.""He pushed the door closed and bolted it. Through the door he could hear Rosie's mother saying, ""The animal. Why didn't you ask him about the animal?""""Because you're just imagining it, Mum. I keep telling you. There isn't an animal in here. Anyway, he's nuts. He'd probably just agree with you. He probably sees invisible tigers himself.""Stung by this, Grahame Coats turned off their lights. He pulled out a bottle of red wine and went upstairs, slamming the cellar door behind him.In the darkness beneath the house, Rosie broke the lump of cheese into four bits and ate one as slowly as she could.""What did he mean about Fat Charlie?"" she asked her mother after the cheese had dissolved in her mouth.""Your bloody Fat Charlie. I don't want to know about Fat Charlie,"" said her mother. ""He's the reason that we're down here.""""No, we're here because that Coats man is a total nutjob. A nutter with a gun. It's not Fat Charlie's fault."" She had tried not to let herself think about Fat Charlie, because thinking about Fat Charlie meant that she inevitably found herself thinking about Spider-""It's back,"" said her mother. ""The animal is back. I heard it. I can smell it.""""Yes Mum,"" said Rosie. She sat on the concrete floor of the meat cellar and thought about Spider. She missed him. When Grahame Coats saw reason and let them go, she'd try to locate Spider, she decided. Find out if there was room for a new beginning. She knew it was only a silly daydream, but it was a good dream, and it comforted her.She wondered if Grahame Coats would kill them tomorrow.A candle flame's thickness away, Spider was staked out for the beast.It was late afternoon, and the sun was low behind him.Spider was pushing at something with his nose and lips: it had been dry earth, before his spit and blood had soaked into it. Now it was a ball of mud, a rough marble of reddish clay. He had pushed it into a shape that was more or less spherical. Now he flicked at it, getting his nose underneath it and then jerking his head up. Nothing happened, as nothing had happened the previous how-many times. Twenty? A hundred? He wasn't keeping count. He simply kept on. He pushed his face further into the dirt, pushed his nose further under the ball of clay, jerked his head up and forward-Nothing happened. Nothing was going to happen.He needed another approach.He closed his lips on the ball, closed them around it. He breathed in through his nose, as deeply as he could. Then he expelled the air through his mouth. The ball popped from his lips, with a pop like a champagne cork, and landed about eighteen inches away.Now he twisted his right hand. It was bound at the wrist, with the rope pulling it tightly toward the stake. He pulled the hand back, bent it around. His fingers reached for the lump of bloody mud, and they fell short.It was so near-Spider took another deep breath but choked on the dry dust and began to cough. He tried again, twisting his head over to one side to fill his lungs. Then he rolled over and began to blow, in the direction of the ball, forcing the air from his lungs as hard as he could.The clay ball rolled - less than an inch, but it was enough. He stretched, and now he was holding the clay in his fingers. He began to pinch the clay between finger and thumb, then turning it and doing it again, Eight times.He repeated the process once more, this time squeezing the pinched clay a little tighter. One of the pinches fell off onto the dirt, but the others held. He had something in his hand that looked like a small ball with seven points coming out of it, like a child's model of the sun.He looked at it with pride: given the circumstances, he felt as proud of it as anything a child has ever brought home from school.The word, that would be the hardest part. Making a spider, or something quite like it, from blood and spit and clay, that was easy. Gods, even minor mischief gods like Spider, know how to do that. But the final part of Making was going to prove the hardest. You need a word to give something life. You need to name it.He opened his mouth. ""Hrrurrrurrr,"" he said, with his tongueless mouth.Nothing happened.He tried again. ""Hrrurrurr!"" The clay sat, a dead lump in his hand.His face fell back into the dirt. He was exhausted. Every movement tore the scabs on his face and chest. They oozed and burned and - worse - itched. Think! he told himself. There had to be a way of doing this-. To talk without his tongue-.His lips still had a layer of clay on them. He sucked at them, moistening as well as he could, without a tongue.He took a deep breath, and let the air push through his lips, controlling it as best he could, saying a word with such certainty that not even the universe could argue with him: he described the thing on his hand, and he said his own name, which was the best magic he knew: ""hhssspphhhrrriiivver.""And on his hand, where the lump of bloody mud had been, sat a fat spider, the color of red clay, with seven spindly legs.Help me, thought Spider. Get help.The spider stared at him, its eyes gleaming in the sunlight. Then it dropped from his hand to the earth, and it proceeded to make its lopsided way into the grass, its gait wobbly and uneven.Spider watched it until it was out of sight. Then he lowered his head into the dirt, and he closed his eyes.The wind changed then, and he smelled the ammoniac scent of male cat on the air. It had marked its territory-High in the air, Spider could hear birds caw in triumph.Fat Charlie's stomach growled. If he had had any superfluous money he would have gone somewhere for dinner, just to get away from his hotel, but he was, as near as dammit, now quite broke, and evening meals were included in the cost of the room, so as soon as it turned seven, he went down to the restaurant.The maitre d' had a glorious smile, and she told him that they would open the restaurant in just a few more minutes. They had to give the band time to finish setting up. Then she looked at him. Fat Charlie was beginning to know that look.""Are you-?"" she began.""Yes,"" he said, resigned. ""I've even got it with me."" He took the lime out of his pocket and showed it to her.""Very nice,"" she said. ""That's definitely a lime you've got there. I was going to say, are you going to want the à la carte menu or would you rather do the buffet?""""Buffet,"" said Fat Charlie. The buffet was free. He stood in the hall outside the restaurant holding his lime.""Just wait a moment,"" said the maitre d'.A small woman came down the corridor from behind Fat Charlie. She smiled at the maitre d' and said, ""Is the restaurant open yet? I'm completely starved.""There was a final thrum-thung-thfum from the bass guitar and a plunk from the electric piano. The band put down their instruments and waved at the maitre d'. ""It's open,"" she said. ""Come in.""The small woman stared at Fat Charlie with an expression of wary surprise. ""Hello Fat Charlie,"" she said. ""What's the lime for?""""It's a long story.""""Well,"" said Daisy. ""We've got the whole of dinnertime ahead of us. Why don't you tell me all about it?""Rosie wondered whether madness could be contagious. In the blind darkness beneath the house on the cliff, she had felt something brush past her. Something soft and lithe. Something huge. Something that growled, softly, as it circled them.""Did you hear that too?"" she said.""Of course I heard it, you stupid girl,"" said her mother. Then she said, ""Is there any orange juice left?""Rosie fumbled in the darkness for the juice carton, passed it to her mother. She heard the sound of drinking, then her mother said, ""The animal will not be the one that kills us. He will.""""Grahame Coats. Yes.""""He's a bad man. There is something riding him, like a horse, but he would be a bad horse, and he is a bad man.""Rosie reached out and held her mother's bony hand in her own. She didn't say anything. There wasn't anything much to say.""You know,"" said her mother, after a while, ""I'm very proud of you. You were a good daughter.""""Oh,"" said Rosie. The idea of not being a disappointment to her mother was a new one, and something about which she was not sure she how she felt.""Maybe you should have married Fat Charlie,"" said her mother. ""Then we wouldn't be here.""""No,"" said Rosie. ""I should never have married Fat Charlie. I don't love Fat Charlie. So you weren't entirely wrong.""They heard a door slam upstairs.""He's gone out,"" said Rosie. ""Quick. While he's out. Dig a tunnel."" First she began to giggle, and then she began to cry.Fat Charlie was trying to understand what daisy was doing on the island. Daisy was trying, equally as hard, to understand what Fat Charlie was doing on the island. Neither of them was having much success. A singer in a long, red, slinky dress, who was too good for a little hotel restaurant's Friday Night Fun, was up on the little dais at the end of the room singing ""I've Got You Under My Skin.""Daisy said, ""You're looking for the lady who lived next door when you were a little boy, because she may be able to help you find your brother.""""I was given a feather. If she's still got it, I may be able to exchange it for my brother. It's worth a try.""She blinked slowly, thoughtfully, entirely unimpressed, and picked at her salad.Fat Charlie said, ""Well, you're here because you think that Grahame Coats came here after he killed Maeve Livingstone. But you're not here as a cop. You just powered in under your own steam on the off-chance that he's here. And if he is here, there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.""Daisy licked a fleck of tomato seed from the corner of her lips, and looked uncomfortable. ""I'm not here as a police officer,"" she said. ""I'm here as a tourist.""""But you just walked off the job and came here after him. They could probably send you to prison for that, or something.""""Then,"" she said, drily, ""it's a good thing that Saint Andrews doesn't have any extradition treaties, isn't it?""Under his breath Fat Charlie said, ""Oh God.""The reason Fat Charlie said ""Oh God,"" was because the singer had left the stage and was now starting to walk around the restaurant with a radio microphone. Right now, she was asking two German tourists where they were from.""Why would he come here?"" asked Fat Charlie.""Confidential banking. Cheap property. No extradition treaties. Maybe he really likes citrus fruit.""""I spent two years terrified of that man,"" said Fat Charlie. ""I'm going to get some more of that fish-and-green-banana thing. You coming?""""I'm fine,"" said Daisy. ""I want to leave room for dessert.""Fat Charlie walked over to the buffet, going the long way around to avoid catching the singer's eye. She was very beautiful, and her red sequined dress caught the light and glittered as she moved. She was better than the band. He wished she'd go back onto the little stage and keep singing her standards - he had enjoyed her ""Night and Day"" and a peculiarly soulful ""Spoonful of Sugar"" - and stop interacting with the diners. Or at least, stop talking to people on his side of the room.He piled his plate high with more of the things he had liked the first time. The thing about bicycling around the island, he thought, was that it gave you an appetite.When he returned to his table, Grahame Coats, with something vaguely beardish growing on the lower part of his face, was sitting next to Daisy, and he was grinning like a weasel on speed. ""Fat Charlie,"" said Grahame Coats, and he chuckled uncomfortably. ""It's amazing, isn't it? I come looking for you here, for a little tat-a-tat, and what do I find as a bonus? This glamorous little police officer. Please, sit down over there and try not to make a scene.""Fat Charlie stood like a waxwork.""Sit down,"" repeated Grahame Coats. ""I have a gun pressed against Miss Day's stomach.""Daisy looked at Fat Charlie imploringly, and she nodded. Her hands were on the tablecloth, pressed flat.Fat Charlie sat down.""Hands where I can see them. Spread them on the table, just like hers.""Fat Charlie obeyed.Grahame Coats sniffed. ""I always knew you were an undercover cop, Nancy,"" he said. ""An agent provocateur, eh? You come into my offices, set me up, steal me blind.""""I never -"" said Fat Charlie, but he saw the look in Grahame Coats's eyes and shut up.""You thought you were so clever,"" said Grahame Coats. ""You all thought I'd fall for it. That was why you sent the other two in, wasn't it? The two at the house? Did you think I'd believe they were really from the cruise ship? You have to get up pretty early in the morning to put one over on me, you know. Who else have you told? Who else knows?""Daisy said, ""I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about, Grahame.""The singer was finishing ""Some of These Days"": her voice was bluesy and rich, and it twined around them all like a velvet scarf.Some of these daysYou're going to miss me honeySome of these daysYou're gonna be so lonelyYou'll miss my huggin'You'll miss my kissin'-""You're going to pay the bill,"" said Grahame. ""Then I'll escort you and the young lady out to the car. And we'll go back to my place, for a proper talk. Any funny business, and I shoot you both. Capiche?""Fat Charlie capiched. He also capiched who had been driving the black Mercedes that afternoon and just how close he had already come to death that day. He was beginning to capiche how utterly cracked Grahame Coats was and how little chance Daisy and he had of getting out of this alive.The singer finished her song. The other people scattered around the restaurant clapped. Fat Charlie kept his hands palms-down on the table. He stared past Graham Coats at the singer, and, with the eye that Grahame Coats could not see, he winked at her. She was tired of people avoiding her eyes; Fat Charlie's wink was extremely welcome.Daisy said, ""Grahame, obviously I came here because of you, but Charlie's just -"" She stopped and made the kind of expression you make when someone pushes a gun barrel deeper into your stomach.Grahame Coats said, ""Listen to me. For the purposes of the innocent bystanders here assembled, we're all good friends. I'm going to put the gun into my pocket, but it will still be pointing at you. We're going to get up. We're going to my car. And I will-""He stopped. A woman with a red spangly dress and a microphone was heading for their table with an enormous smile on her face. She was making for Fat Charlie. She said into her microphone, ""What's your name, darlin'?"" She put the microphone into Fat Charlie's face.""Charlie Nancy,"" said Fat Charlie. His voice caught and wavered.""And where you from, Charlie?""""England. Me and my friends. We're all from England.""""And what do you do, Charlie?""Everything slowed. It was like diving off a cliff into the ocean. It was the only way out. He took a deep breath and said it. ""I'm between jobs,"" he started. ""But I'm really a singer. I sing. Just like you.""""Like me? What kind of things you sing?""Fat Charlie swallowed. ""What have you got?""She turned to the other people at Fat Charlie's table. ""Do you think we could get him to sing for us?"" she asked, gesturing with her microphone.""Er. Don't think so. No. Absatively out of the question,"" said Grahame Coats. Daisy shrugged, her hands flat on the table.The woman in the red dress turned to the rest of the room. ""What do we think?"" she asked them.There was a rustle of clapping from the diners at the other tables, and more enthusiastic applause from the serving staff. The barman called out, ""Sing us something!""The singer leaned in to Fat Charlie, covered the mike, and said, ""Better make it something the boys know.""Fat Charlie said, ""Do they know 'Under the Boardwalk'?"" and she nodded, announced it, and gave him the microphone.The band began to play. The singer led Fat Charlie up to the little stage, his heart beating wildly in his chest.Fat Charlie began to sing, and the audience began to listen.All he had wanted was to buy himself some time, but he felt comfortable. No one was throwing things. He seemed to have plenty of room in his head to think in. He was aware of everyone in the room: the tourists and the serving staff, and the people over at the bar. He could see everything: he could see the barman measuring out a cocktail, and the old woman in the rear of the room filling a large plastic mug with coffee. He was still terrified, still angry, but he took all the terror and the anger, and he put it into the song, and let it all become a song about lazing and loving. As he sang, he thought.What would Spider do? thought Fat Charlie. What would my dad do?He sang. In his song, he told them all exactly what he planned to do under the boardwalk, and it mostly involved making love.The singer in the red dress was smiling and snapping her fingers and shimmying her body to the music. She leaned into the keyboard player's microphone and began to harmonize.I'm actually singing in front of an audience, thought Fat Charlie. Bugger me.He kept his eyes on Grahame Coats.As he entered the last chorus, he began to clap his hands above his head, and soon the whole room was clapping along with him, diners and waiters and chefs, everyone except Grahame Coats, whose hands were beneath the tablecloth, and Daisy, whose hands were flat on the table. Daisy was looking at him as if he was not simply barking mad, but had picked an extremely odd moment to discover his inner Drifters.The audience clapped, and Fat Charlie smiled and he sang, and as he sang he knew, without any shadow of a doubt, that everything was going to be all right. They were going to be just fine, him and Spider and Daisy and Rosie, too, wherever she was, they'd be okay. He knew what he was going to do: it was foolish and unlikely and the act of an idiot, but it would work. And as the last notes of the song faded away, he said, ""There's a young lady at the table I was sitting at. Her name's Daisy Day. She's from England too. Daisy, can you wave at everyone?""Daisy gave him a sick look, but she raised a hand from the table, and she waved.""There's something I wanted to say to Daisy. She doesn't know I'm going to say this."" If this doesn't work, whispered a voice at the back of his head, she's dead. You know that? ""But let's hope she says yes. Daisy? Will you marry me?""The room was quiet. Fat Charlie stared at Daisy, willing her to understand, to play along.Daisy nodded.The diners applauded. This was a floor show. The singer, the maitre d', and several of the waitresses descended on the table, hauled Daisy to her feet, and pulled her over to the middle of the floor. They pulled her over to Fat Charlie, and, as the band played ""I Just Called to Say I Love You,"" he put his arm around her.""You got a ring for her?"" asked the singer.He put his hand into his pocket. ""Here,"" he said to Daisy. ""This is for you."" He put his arms around her and kissed her. If anyone is going to get shot, he thought, it will be now. Then the kiss was over, and people were shaking his hand and hugging him - one man, in town, he said, for the music festival, insisted on giving Fat Charlie his card - and now Daisy was holding the lime he had given her with a very strange expression on her face; and when he looked back to the table they had been sitting at, Grahame Coats was gone.
AB_ch13	AB	Anansi Boys	13	10073	56102	CHAPTER THIRTEENWHICH PROVES TO BE UNLUCKY FOR SOMEThe birds were excited, now. They were cawing and crying and chattering in the treetops. It's coming, thought Spider, and he cursed. He was spent and done. There was nothing left in him. Nothing but fatigue, nothing but exhaustion.He thought about lying on the ground and being devoured. Overall, he decided, it was a lousy way to go. He wasn't even certain that he'd be able to regrow a liver, while he was pretty sure that whatever was stalking him had no plans to stop at just the liver anyway.He began to wrench at the stake. He counted to three, and then, as best as he could and as much as he could, jerked both of his arms toward him so they'd tense the rope and pull the stake, then he counted to three and did it again.It had about as much effect as if he was to try to pull a mountain across a road. One two three- tug. And again. And again.He wondered if the beast would come soon.One two three- tug. One two three- tug.Somewhere, someone was singing, he could hear it. And the song made Spider smile. He found himself wishing that he still had a tongue: he'd stick it out at the tiger when it finally made its appearance. The thought gave him strength.On two three- tug.And the stake gave and shifted in his hands.One more pull and the stake came out of the ground, slick as a sword sliding out of a stone.He pulled the ropes toward him, and held the stake in his hands. It was about three feet long. One end had been sharpened to go into the ground. He pushed it out of the loops of rope with numb hands. Ropes dangled uselessly from his wrists. He hefted the stake in his right hand. It would do. And he knew then that he was being watched: that it had been watching him for some time now, like a cat watching a mousehole.It came to him in silence, or nearly, insinuating its way toward him like a shadow moving across the day. The only movement that caught the eye was its tail, which swished impatiently. Otherwise, it might have been a statue, or a mound of sand that looked, due to a trick of the light, like a monstrous beast, for its coat was a sandy color, its unblinking eyes the green of the midwinter sea. Its face was the wide, cruel face of a panther. In the islands they called any big cat Tiger, and this was every big cat there had ever been - bigger, meaner, more dangerous.Spider's ankles were still hobbled, and he could barely walk. Pins and needles pricked his hands and his feet. He hopped from one foot to another and tried to look as if he was doing it on purpose, some kind of dance of intimidation, and not because standing hurt him.He wanted to crouch and untie his ankles, but he did not dare take his eyes off the beast.The stake was heavy and thick but was too short to be a spear, too clumsy and large to be anything else. Spider held it by the narrower end, where it had been sharpened, and he looked away, out to sea, intentionally not looking at the place the animal was, relying on his peripheral vision for information.What had she said? You will bleat. You will whimper. Your fear will excite him.Spider began to whimper. Then he bleated, like an injured goat, lost and plump and alone.A flash of sandy-colored motion, barely enough time to register teeth and claws as they blurred toward him. Spider swung the stake like a baseball bat as hard as he could, feeling it connect with a satisfying thunk across the beast's nose.Tiger stopped, stared at him as if unable to believe its eyes, then made a noise in the back of its throat, a querulous growl, and it walked, stiff-legged, back in the direction it had come, toward the scrub, as if it had a prior appointment that it wished it could get out of. It glared back at Spider resentfully over its shoulder, a beast in pain, and gave him the look of an animal who would be returning.Spider watched it go.Then he sat down, and untangled and untied his ankles.He walked, a little unsteadily, along the cliff edge, following it gently downhill. Soon a stream crossed his path, running off the cliff edge in a sparkling waterfall. Spider went down on his knees, cupped his hands together, and began to drink the cool water.Then he began to collect rocks. Good, fist-sized rocks. He stacked them together, like snowballs.""You've hardly eaten anything,"" said Rosie.""You eat. Keep your strength up,"" said her mother. ""I had a little of that cheese. It was enough.""It was cold in the meat cellar, and it was dark. Not the kind of dark your eyes get used to, either. There was no light. Rosie had walked the perimeter of the cellar, her fingers trailing against the whitewash and rock and crumbling brick, looking for something that would help, finding nothing.""You used to eat,"" said Rosie. ""Back when Dad was alive.""""Your father,"" said her mother, ""used to eat, too. And see where it got him? A heart attack, aged forty-one. What kind of world is that?""""But he loved his food.""""He loved everything,"" said her mother bitterly. ""He loved food, he loved people, he loved his daughter. He loved cooking. He loved me. What did it get him? Just an early grave. You mustn't go loving things like that. I've told you.""""Yes,"" said Rosie. ""I suppose you have.""She walked toward the sound of her mother's voice, hand in front of her face to stop it banging into one of the metal chains that hung in the middle of the room. She found her mother's bony shoulder, put an arm around her.""I'm not scared,"" said Rosie, in the darkness.""You're crazy, then,"" said her mother.Rosie let go of her mother, moved back into the middle of the room. There was a sudden creaking noise. Dust and powdered plaster fell from the ceiling.""Rosie? What are you doing?"" asked Rosie's mother.""Swinging on the chain.""""You be careful. If that chain gives way, you'll be on the floor with a broken head before you can say Jack Robinson."" There was no answer from her daughter. Mrs. Noah said, ""I told you. You're crazy.""""No,"" said Rosie. ""I'm not. I'm just not scared anymore.""Above them, in the house, the front door slammed.""Bluebeard's home,"" said Rosie's mother.""I know. I heard,"" said Rosie. ""I'm still not scared.""People kept clapping Fat Charlie on the back, and buying him drinks with umbrellas in them; in addition to which, he had now collected five business cards from people in the music world on the island for the festival.All around the room, people were smiling at him. He had an arm around Daisy: he could feel her trembling. She put her lips to his ear. ""You're a complete loony, you know that?""""It worked, didn't it?""She looked at him. ""You're full of surprises.""""Come on,"" he said. ""We're not done yet.""He made for the maitre d'. ""Excuse me-. There was a lady. While I was singing. She came in, refilled her coffee mug from the pot back there, by the bar. Where did she go?""The maitre d' blinked and shrugged. She said, ""I don't know-""""Yes, you do,"" said Fat Charlie. He felt certain, and smart. Soon enough, he knew, he would feel like himself again, but he had sung a song to an audience, and he had enjoyed it. He had done it to save Daisy's life, and his own, and he had done both these things. ""Let's talk out there."" It was the song. While he had been singing, everything had become perfectly clear. It was still clear. He headed for the hallway, and Daisy and the maitre d' followed.""What's your name?"" he asked the maitre d'.""I'm Clarissa.""""Hello, Clarissa. What's your last name?""Daisy said, ""Charlie, shouldn't we call the police?""""In a minute. Clarissa what?""""Higgler.""""And what's your relationship to Benjamin? The concierge?""""He's my brother.""""And how exactly are you two related to Mrs. Higgler. To Callyanne Higgler?""""They're my niece and nephew, Fat Charlie,"" said Mrs. Higgler, from the doorway. ""Now, I think you better listen to your fiancée, and talk to the police. Don't you?""Spider was sitting by the stream on the cliff top, with his back to the cliff and a heap of throwing stones in front of him, when a man came loping out of the long grass. The man was naked, save for a pelt of sandy fur around his waist, behind which a tail hung down; he wore a necklace of teeth, sharp and white and pointed. His hair was long and black. He walked casually toward Spider as if he were merely out for an early-morning constitutional, and Spider's appearance there was a pleasant surprise.Spider picked up a rock the size of a grapefruit, hefted it in his hand.""Heya, Anansi's child,"" said the stranger. ""I was just passing, and I noticed you, and wondered if there was anything I could do to help."" His nose looked crooked and bruised.Spider shook his head. He missed his tongue.""Seeing you there, I find myself thinking, poor Anansi's child, he must be so hungry."" The stranger smiled too widely. ""Here. I've got food enough to share with you."" He had a sack over his shoulder, and now he opened the sack and reached his right hand into it, producing a freshly killed black-tailed lamb. He held it by the neck. Its head lolled. ""Your father and I ate together on many an occasion. Is there any reason that you and I cannot do likewise? You can make the fire and I will clean the lamb and make a spit to turn it. Can you not taste it already?""Spider was so hungry he was light-headed. Had he still been in possession of his tongue, perhaps he would have said yes, confident of his ability to talk himself out of trouble; but he had no tongue. He picked up a second rock in his left hand.""So let us feast and be friends; and let there be no more misunderstandings,"" said the stranger.And the vulture and the raven will clean my bones, thought Spider.The stranger took another step toward Spider, who decided that this was his cue to throw the first rock. He had a good eye and an excellent arm, and the rock struck where he had intended it to strike, on the stranger's right arm; he dropped the lamb. The next rock hit the stranger on the side of the head - Spider had been aiming for a spot just between the too-widely-set eyes, but the man had moved.The stranger ran then, a bounding run, with his tail straight out behind him. Sometimes he looked like a man when he ran, and sometimes he looked like a beast.When he was gone, Spider walked to the place he had been, to retrieve the black-tailed lamb. It was moving, when he reached it, and for a heartbeat he imagined that it was still alive, but then he saw that the flesh was creeping with maggots. It stank, and the stench of the corpse helped Spider forget how hungry he was, for a little while.He carried it at arm's length to the cliff edge and threw it down into the sea. Then he washed his hands in the stream.He did not know how long he had been in this place. Time was stretched and squashed here. The sun was lowering on the horizon.After the sun has set, and before the moon has risen, thought Spider. That is when the beast will be back.The implacably cheerful representative of the Saint Andrews Police force sat in the hotel front office with Daisy and Fat Charlie, and listened to everything each of them had to say with a placid but unimpressed smile on his wide face. Sometimes he would reach up a finger and scratch his moustache.They told the police officer that a fugitive from justice called Grahame Coats had come in to them while they were eating dinner, and threatened Daisy with a gun. Which, they were also forced to admit, nobody but Daisy had actually seen. Then Fat Charlie told him about the incident with the black Mercedes and the bicycle, earlier that afternoon, and no, he hadn't actually seen who was driving the car. But he knew where it came from. He told the officer about the house on the cliff top.The man touched his pepper-and-salt moustache, thoughtfully. ""Indeed, there is a house where you describe. However, it does not belong to your man Coats. Far from it. You are describing the house of Basil Finnegan, an extremely respectable man. For many years, Mr. Finnegan has had a healthy interest in law and order. He has given money to schools, but more important, he contributed a healthy sum toward the construction of the new police station.""""He put a gun to my stomach,"" said Daisy. ""He told me that unless we came with him, he'd shoot.""""If this was Mr. Finnegan, little lady,"" said the police officer, ""I'm sure that there is a perfectly simple explanation."" He opened his briefcase, produced a thick sheaf of papers. ""I'll tell you what. You think about the matter. Sleep on it. If, in the morning, you are convinced that it was more than high spirits, you simply have to fill in this form, and drop off all three copies at the police station. Ask for the new police station, at the back of the city square. Everyone knows where it is.""He shook both of their hands and went on his way.""You should have told him you were a cop too,"" said Fat Charlie. ""He might have taken you more seriously.""""I don't think it would have done any good,"" she said. ""Anyone who calls you 'little lady' has already excluded you from the set of people worth listening to.""They walked out into the hotel reception.""Where did she go?"" asked Fat Charlie.Benjamin Higgler said, ""Aunt Callyanne? She's waiting for you in the conference room.""""There,"" said Rosie."" I knew I could do it, if I just kept swinging.""""He'll kill you.""""He's going to kill us anyway.""""It won't work.""""Mum. Have you got a better idea?""""He'll see you.""""Mum. Will you please stop being so negative? If you've got any suggestions that would help, please say them. Otherwise just don't bother. Okay?""Silence.Then, ""I could show him my bum.""""What?""""You heard me.""""Er. Instead of?""""In addition to.""Silence. Then Rosie said, ""Well, it couldn't hurt.""""Hullo, Mrs. Higgler,""said Fat Charlie. ""I want the feather back.""""What make you think I got your feather?"" she asked, arms folded across her vast bosom.""Mrs. Dunwiddy told me.""Mrs. Higgler seemed surprised by this, for the first time. ""Louella did tell you I got the feather?""""She said you had the feather.""""I keeping it safe."" Mrs. Higgler gestured toward Daisy with her mug of coffee. ""You can't expect me to start talkin' in front of her. I don't know her.""""This is Daisy. You can say anything to her you'd say to me.""""She's your fiancée,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""I heard.""Fat Charlie could feel his cheeks starting to burn. ""She's not my - we aren't, actually. I had to say something to get her away from the man with the gun. It seemed the simplest thing.""Mrs. Higgler looked at him. Behind her thick spectacles, her eyes began to twinkle. ""I know that,"" she said. ""It was during your song. In front of an audience."" She shook her head, in the way that old people like to do when pondering the foolishness of the young. She opened her black purse, took out an envelope, passed it to Fat Charlie. ""I promised Louella I keep it safe.""Fat Charlie took out the feather from the envelope, half-crushed, from where he had been holding it tightly the night of the séance. ""Okay,"" he said. ""Feather. Excellent. Now,"" he said to Mrs. Higgler, ""What exactly do I do with it?""""You don't know?""Fat Charlie's mother had told him, when he was young, to count to ten before he lost his temper. He counted, silently and unhurriedly, to ten, whereupon he lost his temper. ""Of course I don't know what to do with it, you stupid old woman! In the last two weeks I've been arrested, I've lost my fiancée and my job, I've watched my semi-imaginary brother get eaten by a wall of birds in Piccadilly Circus, I've flown back and forth across the Atlantic like some kind of lunatic transatlantic ping-pong ball, and today I got up in front of an audience and I, and I sang because my psycho ex-boss had a gun barrel against the stomach of the girl I'm having dinner with. All I'm trying to do is sort out the mess my life has turned into since you suggested I might want to talk to my brother. So, no. No, I don't know what to do with this bloody feather. Burn it? Chop it up and eat it? Build a nest with it? Hold it out in front of me and jump out of the window?""Mrs. Higgins looked sullen. ""You have to ask Louella Dunwiddy.""""I'm not sure that I can. She wasn't looking very well the last time I saw her. And we don't have much time.""Daisy said, ""Great. You got your feather back. Now, can we please talk about Grahame Coats?""""It's not only a feather. It's the feather I swapped for my brother.""""So swap it back, and let's get on with things. We've got to do something.""""It's not as simple as that,"" said Fat Charlie. Then he stopped, and thought about what he had said and what she had said. He looked at Daisy admiringly. ""God, you're smart,"" he said.""I try,"" she said. ""What did I say?""They didn't have four old ladies, but they had Mrs. Higgler, Benjamin, and Daisy. Dinner was almost finished, so Clarissa, the maitre d', seemed perfectly happy to come and join them. They didn't have earths of four different colors, but there was white sand from the beach behind the hotel and black dirt from the flower bed in front of it, red mud at the side of the hotel, multicolored sand in test tubes in the gift shop. The candles they borrowed from the poolside bar were small and white, not tall and black. Mrs. Higgler assured them that she could find all the herbs they actually needed on the island, but Fat Charlie had Clarissa borrow a pouch of bouquet garni from the kitchen.""I think it's all a matter of confidence,"" Fat Charlie explained. ""The most important thing isn't the details. It's the magical atmosphere.""The magical atmosphere in this case was not enhanced by Benjamin Higgler's tendency to look around the table and burst into explosive giggles nor by Daisy's continually pointing out that the whole procedure was extremely silly.Mrs. Higgler sprinkled the bouquet garni into a bowl of leftover white wine.Mrs. Higgler began to hum. She raised her hands in encouragement, and the others began to hum along with her, like drunken bees. Fat Charlie waited for something to happen.Nothing did.""Fat Charlie,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""You hum too.""Fat Charlie swallowed. There's nothing to be scared of, he told himself: he had sung in front of a roomful of people; he had proposed marriage in front of an audience to a woman he barely knew. Humming would be a doddle.He found the note that Mrs. Higgler was humming, and he let it vibrate in his throat-.He held his feather. He concentrated and he hummed.Benjamin stopped giggling. His eyes widened. There was an expression of alarm on his face, and Fat Charlie was going to stop humming to find out what was troubling him, but the hum was inside him now, and the candles were flickering-.""Look at him!"" said Benjamin. ""He's -""And Fat Charlie would have wondered what exactly he was, but it was too late to wonder.Mists parted.Fat Charlie was walking along a bridge, a long white footbridge across an expanse of gray water. A little way ahead of him, in the middle of the bridge, a man sat on a small wooden chair. The man was fishing. A green fedora hat covered his eyes. He appeared to be dozing, and he did not stir as Fat Charlie approached.Fat Charlie recognized the man. He rested his hand on the man's shoulder.""You know,"" he said, ""I knew you were faking it. I didn't think you were really dead.""The man in the chair did not move, but he smiled. ""Shows how much you know,"" said Anansi. ""I'm dead as they come."" He stretched luxuriantly, pulled a little black cheroot from behind his ear, and lit it with a match. ""Yup. I'm dead. Figure I'll stay dead for a lickle while. If you don't die now and again, people start takin' you for granted.""Fat Charlie said ""But.""Anansi touched his finger to his lips for silence. He picked up his fishing rod and began to wind the reel. He pointed to a small net. Fat Charlie picked it up, and held it out as his father lowered a silver fish, long and wriggling, into it. Anansi took the hook from the fish's mouth then dropped the fish into a white pail. ""There,"" he said. ""That's tonight's dinner taken care of.""For the first time it registered with Fat Charlie that it had been dark night when he had sat down at the table with Daisy and the Higglers, but that while the sun was low wherever he was now, it had not set.His father folded up the chair, and gave Fat Charlie the chair and the bucket to carry. They began to walk along the bridge. ""You know,"" said Mr. Nancy, ""I always thought that if you ever came to talk to me, I'd tell you all manner of things. But you seem to be doing pretty good on your own. So what brings you here?""""I'm not sure. I was trying to find the Bird Woman. I want to give her back her feather.""""You shouldn't have been messin' about with people like that,"" said his father, blithely. ""No good ever comes from it. She's a mess of resentments, that one. But she's a coward.""""It was Spider -"" said Fat Charlie.""Your own fault. Letting that old busybody send half of you away.""""I was only a kid. Why didn't you do anything?""Anansi pushed the hat back on his head. ""Ol' Dunwiddy couldn't do anything to you you didn't let her do,"" he said. ""You're my son, after all.""Fat Charlie thought about this. Then he said, ""But why didn't you tell me?""""You're doing okay. You're figurin' it all out by yourself. You figured out the songs, didn't you?""Fat Charlie felt clumsier and fatter and even more of a disappointment to his father, but he didn't simply say ""No."" Instead he said, ""What do you think?""""I think you're gettin' there. The important thing about songs is that they're just like stories. They don't mean a damn unless there's people listenin' to them.""They were approaching the end of the bridge. Fat Charlie knew, without being told, that this was the last chance they'd ever have to talk. There were so many things he needed to find out, so many things he wanted to know. He said, ""Dad. When I was a kid. Why did you humiliate me?""The old man's brow creased. ""Humiliate you? I loved you.""""You got me to go to school dressed as President Taft. You call that love?""There was a high-pitched yelp of something that might have been laughter from the old man, then he sucked on his cheroot. The smoke drifted from his lips like a ghostly speech balloon. ""Your mother had something to say about that,"" he said. Then he said, ""We don't have long, Charlie. You want to spend the time we got left fighting?""Fat Charlie shook his head. ""Guess not.""They had reached the end of the bridge. ""Now,"" said his father. ""When you see your brother. I want you to give him something from me.""""What?""His father reached up a hand, pulled Fat Charlie's head down. Then he kissed him, gently, on the forehead. ""That,"" he said.Fat Charlie straightened up. His father was looking up at him with an expression that, if he had seen it in anyone else's face, he would have thought of as pride. ""Let me see the feather,"" said his father.Fat Charlie reached into his pocket. The feather was there, looking even more crumpled and dilapidated than it looked before.His father made a ""tch"" noise and held the feather up to the light. ""This is a beautiful feather,"" said his father. ""You don't want it to get all manky. She won't take it back if it's messed up."" Mr. Nancy ran his hand over the feather, and it was perfect. He frowned at it. ""Now, you'll just get it messed up again."" He breathed on his fingernails, polished them against his jacket. Then he seemed to have arrived at a decision. He removed his fedora and slipped the feather into the hatband. ""Here. You could do with a natty hat anyway."" He put the hat onto Fat Charlie's head. ""It suits you,"" he said.Fat Charlie sighed. ""Dad. I don't wear hats. It'll look stupid. I'll look a complete tit. Why do you always try to embarrass me?""In the fading light, the old man looked at his son. ""You think I'd lie to you? Son, all you need to wear a hat is attitude. And you got that. You think I'd tell you you looked good if you didn't? You look real sharp. You don't believe me?""Fat Charlie said, ""Not really.""""Look,"" said his father. He pointed over the side of the bridge. The water beneath them was still and smooth as a mirror, and the man looking up at him from the water looked real sharp in his new green hat.Fat Charlie looked up to tell his father that maybe he had been wrong, but the old man was gone.He stepped off the bridge into the dusk.""Right. I want to know exactly where he is. Where did he go? What have you done to him?""""I didn't do anything. Lord, child,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""This never happened the last time.""""It looked like he was beamed up to the mothership,"" said Benjamin. ""Cool. Real-life special effects.""""I want you to bring him back,"" said Daisy, fiercely. ""I want him backnow.""""I don't even know where he is,"" said Mrs. Higgler. ""And I didn't send him there. He do that himself.""""Anyway,"" said Clarissa. ""What if he's off doing what he's doing and we make him come back? We could ruin it all.""""Exactly,"" said Benjamin. ""Like beaming the landing party back, halfway through their mission.""Daisy thought about this and was irritated to realize that it made sense - as much as anything made sense these days, anyway.""If nothing else is happening,"" said Clarissa, ""I ought to go back to the restaurant. Make sure everything's all right.""Mrs. Higgler sipped her coffee. ""Nothin' happenin' here,"" she agreed.Daisy slammed her hand down on the table. ""Excuse me. We've got a killer out there. And now Fat Charlie's beamed up to the mastership.""""Mothership,"" said Benjamin.Mrs. Higgler blinked. ""Okay,"" she said. ""We should do something. What do you suggest?""""I don't know,"" admitted Daisy and she hated herself for saying it. ""Kill time, I suppose."" She picked up the copy of the Williamstown Courier that Mrs. Higgler had been reading and began to flip through it.The story about the missing tourists, the women who hadn't gone back to their cruise ship was a column on page three. The two at the house, said Grahame Coats in her head. Did you think I'd believe they were from the ship?At the end of the day, Daisy was a cop.""Get me the phone,"" she said.""Who are you calling?""""I think we'll start with the minister of tourism and the chief of police, and we'll go on from there.""The crimson sun was shrinking on the horizon. Spider, had he not been Spider, would have despaired. On the island, in that place, there was a clean line between day and night, and Spider watched the last red crumb of sun being swallowed by the sea. He had his stones and the two stakes.He wished he had fire.He wondered when the moon would be up. When the moon rose, he might have a chance.The sun set - the final smudge of red sank into the dark sea, and it was night.""Anansi's child,"" said a voice from out of the darkness. ""Soon enough, I shall feed. You will not know I am there until you feel my breath on the back of your head. I stood above you, while you were staked out for me, and I could have crunched through your neck then and there, but I thought better of it. Killing you in your sleep would have brought me no pleasure. I want to feel you die. I want you to know why I have taken your life.""Spider threw a rock toward where he thought the voice was coming from, and heard it crash harmlessly into the undergrowth.""You have fingers,"" said the voice, ""but I have claws sharper than knives. You have your two legs, but I have four legs that will never tire, that can run ten times as fast as you ever will and keep on running. Your teeth can eat meat, if it has been made soft and tasteless by the fire, for you have little monkey teeth, good for chewing soft fruit and crawling bugs; but I have teeth that rend and tear the living flesh from the bones, and I can swallow it while the lifeblood still fountains into the sky.""And then Spider made a noise. It was a noise that could be made without a tongue, without even opening his lips. It was a ""meh"" noise of amused disdain. You may be all these things, Tiger, it seemed to say, but so what? All the stories there ever were are Anansi's. Nobody tells Tiger stories.There was a roar from the darkness, a roar of fury and frustration.Spider began to hum the tune of the ""Tiger Rag."" It's an old song, good for teasing tigers with: ""Hold that tiger,"" it goes. "" Where's that tiger?""When the voice came next from the darkness, it was nearer.""I have your woman, Anansi's child. When I am done with you, I shall tear her flesh. Her meat will taste sweeter than yours.""Spider made the ""hmph!"" sound people make when they know they're being lied to.""Her name is Rosie.""Spider made an involuntary noise then.In the darkness, someone laughed. ""And as for eyes,"" it said, ""You have eyes that see the obvious, in broad daylight, if you are lucky, whereas my people have eyes that can see the hairs prickle on your arms as I talk to you, see the terror on your face, and see that in the nighttime. Fear me, Anansi's child, and if you have any final prayers to say, say them now.""Spider had no prayers, but he had rocks, and he could throw them. Perhaps he might get lucky, and a rock might do some damage in the darkness. Spider knew that it would be a miracle if it did, but he had spent his entire life relying on miracles.He reached for another rock.Something brushed the back of his hand.Hello, said the little clay spider, in his mind.Hi, thought Spider. Look, I'm a bit busy here, trying not to be eaten, so if you don't mind keeping out of the way for a while -But I brought them, thought the spider. Like you asked.Like I asked?You told me to go for help. I brought them back with me. They followed my web strand. There are no spiders in this creation, so I slipped back and webbed from there to here and from here to there again. I brought the warriors. I brought the brave.""A penny for your thoughts,"" said the big cat voice in the darkness. And then it said, with a certain refined amusement, ""What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?""A single spider is silent. They cultivate silence. Even the ones that do make noises will normally remain as still as they can, waiting. So much of what spiders do is waiting.The night was slowly filled with a gentle rustling.Spider thought his gratitude and pride at the little seven legged spider he had made from his blood and spittle and from the earth. The spider scuttled from the back of his hand up to his shoulder.Spider could not see them, but he knew they were all there: the great spiders and the small spiders, venomous spiders and biting spiders: huge hairy spiders and elegant chitinous spiders. Their eyes took whatever light they could find, but they saw through their legs and their feet, constructing vibrations into a virtual image of the world about them.They were an army.Tiger spoke again from the darkness. ""When you are dead, Anansi's child - when all of your bloodline is dead - then the stories will be mine. Once again, people will tell Tiger stories. They will gather together and praise my cunning and my strength, my cruelty and my joy. Every story will be mine. Every song will be mine. The world will be as it once was again: a hard place. A dark place.""Spider listened to the rustle of his army.He was sitting at the cliff edge for a reason. While it gave him nowhere to retreat to, it meant that Tiger could not charge, he could only creep.Spider started to laugh.""What are you laughing at, Anansi's child? Have you lost your reason?""At that, Spider laughed longer and louder.There was a yowl from the darkness. Tiger had met Spider's army.Spider venom comes in many forms. It can often take a long while to discover the full effects of the bite. Naturalists have pondered this for years: there are spiders whose bite can cause the place bitten to rot and to die, sometimes more than a year after it was bitten. As to why spiders do this, the answer is simple. It's because spiders think this is funny, and they don't want you ever to forget them.Black widow bites on Tiger's bruised nose, tarantula bites on his ears: in moments his sensitive places burned and throbbed, swelled and itched. Tiger did not know what was happening: all he knew was the burning and the pain and the sudden fear.Spider laughed, longer and louder, and listened to the sound of a huge animal bolting into the undergrowth, roaring in agony and in fright.Then he sat and he waited. Tiger would be back, he had no doubt. It was not over yet.Spider took the seven-legged spider from his shoulder and stroked it, running his fingers back and forth across its broad back.A little way down the hill something glowed with a cold green luminescence, and it flickered, like the lights of a tiny city, flashing on and off into the night. It was coming toward him.The flickering resolved itself into a hundred thousand fire-flies. Silhouetted and illuminated in the center of the firefly-light was a dark figure, man-shaped. It was walking steadily up the hill.Spider raised a rock and mentally readied his spider troops for one more attack. And then he stopped. There was something familiar about the figure in the firefly-light; it wore a green fedora.Grahame Coats was most of the way through a half bottle of rum he had found in the kitchen. He had opened the rum because he had no desire to go down into the wine cellar, and because he imagined it would get him drunk faster than wine would. Unfortunately, it didn't. It did not seem to be doing much of anything, let alone providing the emotional off-switch he felt he needed. He walked around the house with a bottle in one hand and a half-full glass in the other, and sometimes he took a swig from one, and sometimes from the other. He caught sight of his reflection in the mirror, hangdog and sweaty. ""Cheer up,"" he said aloud. ""Might never happen. Cloud silver lining. Life rain mus' fall. Too many cooks. 'S an ill wind."" The rum was pretty much gone.He went back into the kitchen. He opened several cupboards before he noticed a bottle of sherry toward the back. Grahame picked it up and cradled it gratefully, as if it were a very small old friend who had just returned after years at sea.He unscrewed the top of the bottle. It was a sweet cooking sherry, but he drank it down like lemonade.There were other things Grahame Coats had noticed while looking for alcohol in the kitchen. There were, for example, knives. Some of them were very sharp. In a drawer, there was even a small stainless steel hacksaw. Grahame Coats approved. It would be the very simple solution to the problem in the basement.""Habeas corpus,"" he said. ""Or habeas delicti. One of those. If there is no body, then there was no crime. Ergo.Quod erat demonstrandum.""He took his gun out of his jacket pocket, put it on the kitchen table. He arranged the knives around it in a pattern, like the spokes of a wheel. ""Well,"" he said, in the same tones he had once used to persuade innocent boy bands that it was time to sign their contract with him and to say hello to fame if not actually fortune, ""no time like the present.""He pushed three kitchen knives blade-down through his belt, placed the hacksaw in his jacket pocket, and then, gun in hand, he went down the cellar stairs. He turned on the lights, blinked at the wine bottles on their side, each in their rack, each covered with a thin layer of dust, and then he was standing beside the iron meat locker door.""Right,"" he shouted. ""You'll be pleased to hear that I'm not going to hurt you. I'll be letting you both go now. All a bit of a mistake. Still, no hard feelings. No use crying over spilt. Stand by the far wall. Assume the position. No funny stuff.""It was, he reflected, as he pulled back the bolts, almost comforting how many clichÉs already exist for people holding guns. It made Grahame Coats feel like one of a brotherhood: Bogart stood beside him, and Cagney, and all the people who shout at each other on COPS.He turned the light on and pulled open the door. Rosie's mother stood against the far wall, with her back to him. As he came in, she flipped up her skirt and waggled an astonishingly bony brown bottom.His jaw dropped open. That was when Rosie slammed down a length of rusty chain onto Grahame Coats's wrist, sending the gun flying across the room.With the enthusiasm and accuracy of a much younger woman, Rosie's mother kicked Grahame Coats in the groin, and as he clutched his crotch and doubled up, making noises pitched at a level that only dogs and bats could hear, Rosie and her mother stumbled out of the meat locker.They pushed the door closed and Rosie pushed shut one of the bolts. They hugged.They were still in the wine cellar when all the lights went off.""It's just the fuses,"" said Rosie, to reassure her mother. She was not certain that she believed it, but she had no other explanation.""You should have locked both bolts,"" said her mother. And then, ""Ow,"" as she stubbed her toe on something, and cursed.""On the bright side,"" said Rosie, ""He can't see in the dark either. Just hold my hand. I think the stairs are up this way.""Grahame Coats was down on all fours on the concrete floor of the meat cellar, in the darkness, when the lights went out. There was something hot dripping down his leg. He thought for one uncomfortable moment that he had wet himself, before he understood that the blade of one of the knives he had pushed into his belt had cut deeply into the top of his leg.He stopped moving and lay on the floor. He decided that he had been very sensible to have drunk so much: it was practically an anaesthetic. He decided to go to sleep.He was not alone in the meat locker. There was someone in there with him. Something that moved on four legs.Somebody growled, ""Get up.""""Can't get up. I'm hurt. Want to go to bed.""""You're a pitiful little creature and you destroy everything you touch. Now get up.""""Would love to,"" said Grahame Coats in the reasonable tones of a drunk. ""Can't. Just going to lie on the floor for a bit. Anyway. She bolted the door. I heard her.""He heard a scraping from the other side of the door, as if a bolt was slowly being released.""The door is open. Now: if you stay here, you'll die."" An impatient rustling; the swish of a tail; a roar, half-muffled in the back of a throat. ""Give me your hand and your allegiance. Invite me inside you.""""I don't underst-""""Give me your hand, or bleed to death.""In the black of the meat cellar, Grahame Coats put out his hand. Someone - something - took it and held it, reassuringly. ""Now, are you willing to invite me in?""A moment of cold sobriety touched Grahame Coats then. He had already gone too far. Nothing he did would make matters worse, after all.""Absatively,"" whispered Grahame Coats, and as he said it he began to change. He could see through the darkness easy as daylight. He thought, but only for a moment, that he saw something beside him, bigger than a man, with sharp, sharp teeth. And then it was gone, and Grahame Coats felt wonderful. The blood no longer spurted from his leg.He could see clearly in the darkness. He pulled the knives from his belt, dropped them onto the floor. He pulled off his shoes, too. There was a gun on the ground, but he left it there. Tools were for apes and crows and weaklings. He was no ape.He was a hunter.He pulled himself up onto his hands and his knees, and then he padded, four-footed, out into the wine cellar.He could see the women. They had found the steps up to the house, and they were edging up them blindly, hand-in-hand in the darkness.One of them was old and stringy. The other was young and tender. The mouth salivated in something that was only partly Grahame Coats.Fat Charlie left the bridge, with his father's green fedora pushed back on his head, and he walked into the dusk. He walked up the rocky beach, slipping on the rocks, splashing into pools. Then he trod on something that moved. A stumble, and he stepped off it.It rose into the air, and it kept rising. Whatever it was, it was enormous: he thought at first that it was the size of an elephant, but it grew bigger still.Light, thought Fat Charlie. He sang aloud, and all the lightning bugs, the fireflies of that place, clustered around him, flickering off and on with their cold green luminescence, and in their light he could make out two eyes, bigger than dinner plates, staring down at him from a supercilious reptilian face.He stared back. ""Evening,"" he said, cheerfully.A voice from the creature, smooth as buttered oil. ""He-llo,"" it said. ""Ding-dong. You look remarkably like dinner.""""I'm Charlie Nancy,"" said Charlie Nancy. ""Who are you?""""I am Dragon,"" said the dragon. ""And I shall devour you in one slow mouthful, little man in a hat.""Charlie blinked. What would my father do? he wondered. What would Spider have done? He had absolutely no idea. Come on. After all, Spider's sort of a part of me. I can do whatever he can do.""Er. You're bored with talking to me now, and you're going to let me pass unhindered,"" he told the dragon, with as much conviction as he was able to muster.""Gosh. Good try. But I'm afraid I'm not,"" said the dragon, enthusiastically. ""Actually, I'm going to eat you.""""You aren't scared of limes, are you?"" asked Charlie, before remembering that he'd given the lime to Daisy.The creature laughed, scornfully. ""I,"" it said, ""am frightened of nothing.""""Nothing?""""Nothing,"" it said.Charlie said, ""Are you extremely frightened of nothing?""""Absolutely terrified of it,"" admitted the Dragon.""You know,"" said Charlie, ""I have nothing in my pockets. Would you like to see it?""""No,"" said the Dragon, uncomfortably, ""I most definitely would not.""There was a flapping of wings like sails, and Charlie was alone on the beach. ""That,"" he said, ""was much too easy.""He kept on walking. He made up a song for his walk. Charlie had always wanted to make up songs, but he never did, mostly because of the conviction that if he ever had written a song, someone would have asked him to sing it, and that would not have been a good thing, much as death by hanging would not be a good thing. Now, he cared less and less, and he sang his song to the fireflies, who followed him up the hillside. It was a song about meeting the Bird Woman and finding his brother. He hoped the fireflies were enjoying it: their light seemed to be pulsing and flickering in time with the tune.The Bird Woman was waiting for him at the top of the hill.Charlie took off his hat. He pulled the feather from the hatband.""Here. This is yours, I believe.""She made no move to take it.""Our deal's over,"" said Charlie. ""I brought your feather. I want my brother. You took him. I want him back. Anansi's bloodline was not mine to give.""""And if I no longer have your brother?""It was hard to tell, in the firefly light, but Charlie did not believe that her lips had moved. Her words surrounded him, however, in the cries of nightjars, and in the owls' shrieks and hoots.""I want my brother back,"" he told her. ""I want him whole and in one piece and uninjured. And I want him now. Or whatever went on between you and my father over the years was just the prelude. You know. The overture.""Charlie had never threatened anyone before. He had no idea how he would carry out his threats - but he had no doubt that he would indeed carry them out.""I had him,"" she said, in the bittern's distant boom ""But I left him, tongueless, in Tiger's world. I could not hurt your father's line. Tiger could, once he found his courage.""A hush. The night frogs and the night birds were perfectly silent. She stared at him impassively, her face almost part of the shadows. Her hand went into the pocket of her coat. ""Give me the feather,"" she said.Charlie put it into her hand.He felt lighter, then, as if she had taken more from him than just an old feather-Then she placed something into his hand: something cold and damp. It felt like a lump of meat, and Charlie had to quell the urge to fling it away.""Return it to him,"" she said, in the voice of the night. ""He has no quarrel with me now.""""How do I get to Tiger's world?""""How did you get here?"" she asked, sounding almost amused, and the night was complete, and Charlie was alone on the hill.He opened his hand and looked at the lump of meat that sat there, floppy and ridged. It looked like a tongue, and he knew whose tongue it had to be.He put the fedora back on his head, and he thought, Put my thinking cap on, and as he thought it, it didn't seem so funny. The green fedora was not a thinking cap: but it was the kind of hat that would be worn by someone who not only thought but also came to conclusions of an important and vital kind.He imagined the worlds as a web: it blazed in his mind, connecting him to everyone he knew. The strand that connected him to Spider was strong and bright, and it burned with a cold light, like a lightning bug or a star.Spider had been a part of him once. He held onto this knowledge and let the web fill his mind. And in his hand was his brother's tongue: that had been part of Spider until very recently, and it wished devoutly to be part of him again. Living things remember.The wild light of the web burned about him. All Charlie needed to do was follow it-.He followed it, and the fireflies clustered around and traveled with him.""Hey,"" he said. ""It's me.""Spider made a small, terrible noise.In the glimmer of firefly light, Spider looked awful: he looked hunted and he looked hurt. There were scabs on his face and chest.""I think this is probably yours,"" said Charlie.Spider took the tongue from his brother, with an exaggerated thank you gesture, placed it into his mouth, pushed it in, and held it down. Charlie watched and waited. Soon Spider seemed satisfied - he moved his mouth experimentally, pushing the tongue to one side and then to the other, as if he were preparing to shave off a moustache, opening his mouth widely and waggling his tongue about. He closed his mouth and stood up. Finally, in a voice that was still a little wobbly around the edges, he said, ""Nice hat.""Rosie made it to the top of the steps first, and she pushed open the wine cellar door. She stumbled into the house. She waited for her mother, then she slammed and bolted the cellar door. The power was out here, but the moon was high and nearly full, and, after the darkness, the pallid moonlight coming through the kitchen windows might as well have been floodlighting.Boys and girls come out to play, thought Rosie. The moon does shine as bright as day-""Phone the police,"" said her mother.""Where's the phone?""""How the hell should I know where the phone is? He's still down there.""""Right,"" said Rosie, wondering whether she should find a phone to call the police or just get out of the house, but before she had reached a decision, it was too late.There was a bang so loud it hurt her ears, and the door to the cellar crashed open.The shadow came out of the cellar.It was real. She knew it was real. She was looking at it. But it was impossible: it was the shadow of a great cat, shaggy and huge. Strangely, though, when the moonlight touched it, the shadow seemed darker. Rosie could not see its eyes, but she knew it was looking at her, and that it was hungry.It was going to kill her. This was where it would end.Her mother said, ""It wants you, Rosie.""""I know.""Rosie picked up the nearest large object, a wooden block that had once held knives, and she threw it at the shadow as hard as she could, and then, without waiting to see if it made contact, she moved as fast as she could out of the kitchen, into the hallway. She knew where the front door was-Something dark, something four-footed, moved faster: it bounded over her head, landing almost silently in front of her.Rosie backed up against the wall. Her mouth was dry.The beast was between them and the front door, and it was padding slowly toward Rosie, as if it had all the time in the world.Her mother ran out of the kitchen then, then, ran past Rosie - tottered down the moonlit corridor toward the great shadow, her arms flailing. With her thin fists she punched the thing in the ribs. There was a pause, as if the world was holding its breath, and then it turned on her. A blur of motion and Rosie's mother was down on the ground, while the shadow shook her like a dog with a rag doll between its teeth.The doorbell rang.Rosie wanted to call for help but instead she found she was screaming, loudly and insistently. Rosie, when confronted with an unexpected spider in a bathtub, was capable of screaming like a B-movie actress on her first encounter with a man in a rubber suit. Now she was in a dark house containing a shadowy tiger and a potential serial killer, and one, perhaps both, of those entities, had just attacked her mother. Her head thought of a couple of courses of action (the gun: the gun was down in the cellar. She ought to go down and get the gun. Or the door - she could try to get past her mother and the shadow and unlock the front door) but her lungs and her mouth would only scream.Something banged at the front door. They're trying to break in, she thought. They won't get through that door. It's solid.Her mother lay on the floor in a patch of moonlight, and the shadow crouched above her, and it threw back its head and it roared, a deep rattling roar of fear and challenge and possession.I'm hallucinating, thought Rosie with a wild certainty. I've been locked up in a cellar for two days and now I'm hallucinating. There is no tiger.By the same token, she was certain that there was no pale woman in the moonlight, even though she could see her walking down the corridor, a woman with blonde hair and the long, long legs and narrow hips of a dancer. The woman stopped when she reached the shadow of the tiger. She said, ""Hello, Grahame.""The shadow-beast lifted its massive head and growled.""Don't think you can hide from me in that silly animal costume,"" said the woman. She did not look pleased.Rosie realized that she could see the window through the woman's upper body, and she backed up until she was pressing hard against the wall.The beast growled again, this time a little more uncertainly.The woman said, ""I don't believe in ghosts, Grahame. I spent my life, my whole life, not believing in ghosts. And then I met you. You let Morris's career run aground. You steal from us. You murder me. And finally, to add insult to injury, you force me to believe in ghosts.""The shadowy big-cat-shape was whimpering now, and backing down the hall.""Don't think you can avoid me like that, you useless little man. You can pretend to be a tiger all you like. You aren't a tiger. You're a rat. No, that's an insult to a noble and numerous species of rodent. You're less than a rat. You're a gerbil. You're a stoat.""Rosie ran down the hall. She ran past the shadow-beast, past her fallen mother. She ran through the pale woman, and it felt like she was passing through fog. She reached the front door, and began feeling for the bolts.In her head or in the world Rosie could hear an argument. Someone was saying, 'Pay no attention to her, idiot. She can't touch you. It's just a duppy. She's barely real. Get the girl! Stop the girl!'And someone else was replying, 'You certainly do have a valid point here. But I'm not convinced that you've taken all the circumstances into account, vis-à-vis, well, discretion, um, better part of valor, if you follow me- I lead. You follow. But-'""What I want to know,"" said the pale woman, ""is just how ghostly you currently are. I mean, I can't touch people. I can't really even touch things. I can touch ghosts.""The pale woman aimed a serious kick at the beast's face. The shadow-cat hissed and took a step back, and the foot missed it by less than an inch.The next kick connected, and the beast yowled. Another kick, hard against the place the cat's shadowy nose would be, and the beast made the noise of a cat being shampooed, a lonely wail of horror and outrage, of shame and defeat.The corridor was filled with the sound of a dead woman laughing, a laugh of exultation and delight. ""Stoat,"" said the pale woman's voice again. ""Grahame Stoat.""A cold wind blew through the house.Rosie pulled the last of the bolts, and she turned the lock. The front door fell open. There were the beams of flashlights, blinding-bright. People. Cars. A woman's voice said, ""It's one of the missing tourists."" And then she said, ""My God.""Rosie turned.In the flashlight's beam Rosie could see her mother, crumpled on the tiled floor and, beside her, shoeless and unconscious and unmistakably human, Grahame Coats. There was a red liquid splashed all around them, like crimson paint, and Rosie found herself, for a breath, unable to work out what it was.A woman was talking to her. She was saying, ""You're Rosie Noah. My name's Daisy. Let's find somewhere for you to sit down. Would you like to sit down?""Someone must have found the fuse box, for at that moment the lights went on all over the house.A large man in a police uniform was bent over the bodies. He looked up and said, ""It is definitely Mr. Finnegan. He is not breathing.""Rosie said, ""Yes, please. I would like to sit down very much.""Charlie sat beside Spider on the edge of the cliff, in the moonlight, his legs dangling over the side.""You know,"" he said, ""you used to be a part of me. When we were kids.""Spider put his head on one side. ""Really?""""I think so.""""Well, that would explain a few things."" He held out his hand: a seven-legged clay spider sat on the back of his fingers, tasting the air. ""So what now? Are you going to take me back or something?""Charlie's brow crinkled. ""I think you've turned out better than you would have done if you were part of me. And you've had a lot more fun.""Spider said, ""Rosie. Tiger knows about Rosie. We have to do something.""""Of course we do,"" said Charlie. It was like bookkeeping, he thought: you put entries in one column, deduct them from another, and if you've done it correctly, everything should come out right at the bottom of the page. He took his brother's hand.They stood up and took a step forward, off the cliff --and everything was bright-A cold wind blew between the worlds.Charlie said, ""You're not the magical bit of me, you know.""""I'm not?"" Spider took another step. Stars were falling now by the dozen, streaking their way across the dark sky. Someone, somewhere, was playing high sweet music on a flute.Another step, and now distant sirens were blaring. ""No,"" said Charlie. ""You're not. Mrs. Dunwiddy thought you were, I think. She split us apart, but she never really understood what she was doing. We're more like two halves of a starfish. You grew up into a whole person. And so,"" he said, realizing it was true as he said it, ""did I.""They stood on the cliff edge in the dawn. An ambulance was on its way up the hill, lights flashing, and another behind that. They parked by the side of the road, beside a cluster of police cars.Daisy seemed to be telling everyone what to do.""Not much that we can do here. Not now,"" said Charlie. ""Come on."" The last of the fireflies left him, and blinked its way to sleep.They rode the first minibus of the morning back to Williamstown.Maeve Livingstone sat upstairs in the library of Grahame Coats's house, surrounded by Grahame Coats's art and books and DVDs, and she stared out of the window. Down below the island's emergency services were putting Rosie and her mother into one ambulance, Grahame Coats into another.She had, she reflected, really enjoyed kicking the beast-thing that Grahame Coats had become. It was the most profoundly satisfying thing she had done since she had been killed - although if she were to be honest with herself, she would have to admit that dancing with Mr. Nancy came in an extremely close second. He had been remarkably spry, and nimble on his feet.She was tired.""Maeve?""""Morris?"" She looked around her, but the room was empty.""I wouldn't want to disturb you, if you were still busy, pet.""""That's very sweet of you,"" she said. ""But I think I'm done now.""The walls of the library were beginning to fade. They were losing color and form. The world behind the walls was starting to show, and in its light she saw a small figure in a smart suit waiting for her.Her hand crept into his. She said, ""Where are we going now, Morris?""He told her.""Oh. Well, that will be a pleasant change,"" she said. ""I've always wanted to go there.""And, hand in hand, they went.
AB_ch14	AB	Anansi Boys	14	6703	37579	CHAPTER FOURTEENWHICH COMES TO SEVERAL CONCLUSIONSCharlie woke to a banging on a door. Disoriented, he looked around: he was in a hotel room; various unlikely events clustered inside his head like moths around a naked bulb, and while he tried to make sense of them he let his feet get up and walk him to the hotel room door. He blinked at the diagram on the back of the door which told him where to go in case of fire, trying to remember the events of the previous night. Then he unlocked the door and pulled it open.Daisy looked up at him. She said, ""Were you asleep in that hat?""Charlie put his hand up and felt his head. There was definitely a hat on it. ""Yes,"" he said. ""I think I must have been.""""Bless,"" she said. ""Well, at least you took your shoes off. You know you missed all the excitement, last night?""""I did?""""Brush your teeth,"" she said helpfully. ""And change your shirt. Yes, you did. While you were-"" and then she hesitated. It seemed quite improbable, on reflection, that he really had vanished in the middle of a séance. These things did not happen. Not in the real world. ""While you weren't there. I got the police chief to go up to Grahame Coats's house. He had those tourists.""""Tourists-?""""It was what he said at dinner, something about us sending the two people in, the two at the house. It was your fiancée and her mother. He'd locked them up in his basement.""""Are they okay?""""They're both in the hospital.""""Oh.""""Her mum's in rough shape. I think your fiancée will be okay.""""Will you stop calling her that? She's not my fiancée. She ended the engagement.""""Yes. But you didn't, did you?""""She's not in love with me,"" said Charlie. ""Now, I'm going to brush my teeth and change my shirt, and I need a certain amount of privacy.""""You should shower too,"" she said. ""And that hat smells like a cigar.""""It's a family heirloom,"" he told her, and he went into the bathroom and locked the door behind him.The hospital was a ten-minute-walk from the hotel, and Spider was sitting in the waiting room, holding a dog-eared copy of Entertainment Weekly magazine as if he were actually reading it.Charlie tapped him on the shoulder, and Spider jumped. He looked up warily and then, seeing his brother, he relaxed, but not much. ""They said I had to wait out here,"" Spider said. ""Because I'm not a relation or anything.""Charlie boggled. ""Well, why didn't you just tell them you were a relative? Or a doctor?""Spider looked uncomfortable. ""Well, it's easy to do that stuff if you don't care. If it doesn't matter if I go in or I don't, it's easy to go in. But now it matters, and I'd hate to get in the way or do something wrong, and I mean, what if I tried and they said no, and then- what are you grinning about?""""Nothing really,"" said Charlie. ""It just all sounds a bit familiar. Come on. Let's go and find Rosie. You know,"" he said to Daisy, as they set off down a random corridor, ""there are two ways to walk through a hospital. Either you look like you belong there - here you go Spider. White coat on back of door, just your size. Put it on - or you should look so out of place that no one will complain that you're there. They'll just leave it for someone else to sort out."" He began to hum.""What's that song?"" asked Daisy.""It's called 'Yellow Bird,' "" said Spider.Charlie pushed his hat back on his head, and they walked into Rosie's hospital room.Rosie was sitting up in bed, reading a magazine, and looking worried. When she saw the three of them come in, she looked more worried. She looked from Spider to Charlie and back again.""You're both a long way from home,"" was all she said.""We all are,"" said Charlie. ""Now, you've met Spider. This is Daisy. She's in the police.""""I'm not sure that I am anymore,"" said Daisy. ""I'm probably in all kinds of hot water.""""You're the one who was there last night? The one who got the island police to come up to the house?"" Rosie stopped. She said, ""Any word on Grahame Coats?""""He's in intensive care, just like your mum.""""Well, if she comes to before he does,"" said Rosie, ""I expect she'll kill him."" Then she said, ""They won't talk to me about my mum's condition. They just say that it's very serious, and they'll tell me as soon as there's anything to tell."" She looked at Charlie with clear eyes. ""She's not as bad as you think she is, really. Not when you get time to know her. We had a lot of time to talk, locked up in the dark. She's all right.""She blew her nose. Then she said, ""They don't think she's going to make it. They haven't directly said that to me, but they sort of said it in a not-saying-it sort of way. It's funny. I thought she'd live through anything.""Charlie said, ""Me too. I figured even if there was a nuclear war, it would still leave radioactive cockroaches and your mum.""Daisy stepped on his foot. She said, ""Do they know anything more about what hurt her?""""I told them,"" said Rosie. ""There was some kind of animal in the house. Maybe it was just Grahame Coats. I mean it sort of was him, but it was sort of someone else. She distracted it from me, and it went for her-"" She had explained it all as best she could to the island police that morning. She had decided not to talk about the blonde ghost-woman. Sometimes minds snap under pressure, and she thought it best if people did not know that hers had.Rosie broke off. She was staring at Spider as if she had only just remembered who he was. She said, ""I still hate you, you know."" Spider said nothing, but a miserable expression crept across his face, and he no longer looked like a doctor: now he looked like a man who had borrowed a white coat from behind a door and was worried that someone would notice. A dreamlike tone came into her voice. ""Only,"" she said, ""only when I was in the dark, I thought that you were helping me. That you were keeping the animal away. What happened to your face? It's all scratched.""""It was an animal,"" said Spider.""You know,"" she said, ""Now I see you both at once, you don't look anything alike at all.""""I'm the good-looking one,"" said Charlie, and Daisy's foot pressed down on his toes for the second time.""Bless,"" said Daisy, quietly. And then, slightly louder, ""Charlie? There's something we need to talk about outside. Now.""They went out into the hospital corridor, leaving Spider inside.""What?"" said Charlie.""What what?"" said Daisy.""What have we got to talk about?""""Nothing.""""Then why are we out here? You heard her. She hates him. We shouldn't have left them alone together. She's probably killed him by now.""Daisy looked up at him with the kind of expression that Jesus might have given someone who had just explained that he was probably allergic to bread and fishes, so could He possibly do him a quick chicken salad: there was pity in that expression, along with almost infinite compassion.She touched a finger to her lips and pulled him back toward the door. He looked back into the hospital room: Rosie did not appear to be killing Spider. Quite the opposite, if anything. ""Oh,"" said Charlie.They were kissing. Put like that, and you could be forgiven for presuming that this was a normal kiss, all lips and skin and possibly even a little tongue. You'd miss how he smiled, how his eyes glowed. And then, after the kiss was done, how he stood, like a man who had just discovered the art of standing and had figured out how to do it better than anyone else who would ever come along.Charlie turned his attention back to the corridor to find Daisy in conversation with several doctors and the police officer they had encountered the previous evening.""Well, we always had him figured as a bad man,"" the police officer was saying to Daisy. ""I mean, frankly, you only get this kind of behavior from foreigners. The local people, they simply wouldn't do that kind of thing.""""Obviously not,"" said Daisy.""Very. Very grateful,"" said the police chief, patting her shoulder in a way that set Daisy's teeth on edge. ""This little lady saved that woman's life,"" he told Charlie, giving his shoulder a patronizing pat for good measure, before setting off with the doctors down the corridor.""So what's happening?"" asked Charlie.""Well, Grahame Coats is dead,"" she said. ""More or less. And they don't hold out any hope for Rosie's mum, either.""""I see,"" said Charlie. He thought about this. Then he finished thinking and came to a decision. Said, ""Would you mind if I just chatted to my brother for a bit? I think he and I need to talk.""""I'm going back to the hotel anyway. I'm going to check my e-mail. Probably going to have to say sorry on the phone a lot. Find out if I still have a career.""""But you're a hero, aren't you?""""I don't think that's what anyone was paying me for,"" she said, a little wanly. ""Come and find me at the hotel when you're done.""Spider and Charlie walked down the Williamstown high street in the morning sun.""You know, that really is a good hat,"" said Spider.""You really think so?""""Yeah. Can I try it on?""Charlie gave Spider the green fedora. Spider put it on, looked at his reflection in a shop window. He made a face and gave Charlie the hat back. ""Well,"" he said, disappointed, ""it looks good on you, anyway.""Charlie pushed his fedora back onto his head. Some hats can only be worn if you're willing to be jaunty, to set them at an angle and to walk beneath them with a spring in your stride as if you're only a step away from dancing. They demand a lot of you. This hat was one of those, and Charlie was up to it. He said, ""Rosie's mum is dying.""""Yeah.""""I really, really never liked her.""""I didn't know her as well as you did. But given time, I'm sure I would have really, really disliked her too.""Charlie said, ""We have to try and save her life, don't we?"" He said it without enthusiasm, like someone pointing out it was time to visit the dentist.""I don't think we can do things like that.""""Dad did something like it for mum. He got her better, for a while.""""But that was him. I don't know how we'd do that.""Charlie said, ""The place at the end of the world. With the caves.""""Beginning of the world, not the end. What about it?""""Can we just get there? Without all that candles-and-herbs malarkey?""Spider was quiet. Then he nodded, ""I think so.""They turned together, turned in a direction that wasn't usually there, and they walked away from the Williamstown high street.Now the sun was rising, and Charlie and Spider walked across a beach littered with skulls. They were not proper human skulls, and they covered the beach like yellow pebbles. Charlie avoided them where he could, while Spider crunched his way through them. At the end of the beach they took a left turn that was left to absolutely everything, and the mountains at the beginning of the world towered above them and the cliffs fell away below.Charlie remembered the last time he was here, and it seemed like a thousand years ago. ""Where is everyone?"" he said aloud, and his voice echoed against the rocks and came back to him. He said, loudly, ""Hello?""And then they were there, watching him. All of them. They seemed grander, now, less human, more animal, wilder. He realized that he had seen them as people last time because he had expected to meet people. But they were not people. Arrayed on the rocks above them were Lion and Elephant, Crocodile and Python, Rabbit and Scorpion, and the rest of them, hundreds of them, and they stared at him with eyes unsmiling: animals he recognized; animals that no one living would be able to identify. All the animals that have ever been in stories. All the animals that people have dreamed of, worshipped, or placated.Charlie saw all of them.It's one thing, he thought, singing for your life, in a room filled with diners, on the spur of the moment, with a gun barrel in the ribs of the girl you-That you-Oh.Well, thought Charlie, I can worry about that later.Right now he badly wanted either to breathe into a brown paper bag or to vanish.""There must be hundreds of them,"" said Spider, and there was awe in his voice.There was a flurry in the air, on a nearby rock, which resolved itself into the Bird Woman. She folded her arms and stared at them.""Whatever it is you're going to do,"" Spider said, ""you better do it soon. They aren't going to wait around forever.""Charlie's mouth was dry. ""Right.""Spider said, ""So. Um. What exactly do we do now?""""We sing to them,"" said Charlie, simply.""What?""""It's how we fix things. I figured it out. We just sing it all, you and I.""""I don't understand. Sing what?""Charlie said, ""The song. You sing the song, you fix things."" Now he sounded desperate. ""The song.""Spider's eyes were like puddles after the rain, and Charlie saw things in them he had not seen before: affection, perhaps, and confusion and, mostly, apology. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""Lion watched them from the side of a boulder. Monkey looked at them from the top of a tree. And Tiger-Charlie saw Tiger. It was walking gingerly on four feet. Its face was swollen and bruised, but there was a glint in its eyes, and it looked as if it would be more than happy to even the score.Charlie opened his mouth. A small croaking noise came out, as if Charlie had recently swallowed a particularly nervous frog. ""It's no use,"" he whispered to Spider. ""This was a stupid idea, wasn't it?""""Yup.""""Do you think we can just go away again?"" Charlie's nervous glance swept the mountainside and the caves, took in each of the hundreds of totem creatures from before the dawn of time. There was one he had not seen the last time he had looked: a small man, with lemon yellow gloves and a pencil-thin moustache and no fedora hat to cover his thinning hair.The old man winked when he caught Charlie's gaze.It wasn't much, but it was enough.Charlie filled his lungs, and he began to sing. ""I am Charlie,"" he sang. ""I am Anansi's son. Listen as I sing my song. Listen to my life.""He sang them the song of a boy who was half a god, and who was broken into two by an old woman with a grudge. He sang of his father, and he sang of his mother.He sang of names and words, of the building blocks beneath the real, the worlds that make worlds, the truths beneath the way things are; he sang of appropriate ends and just conclusions for those who would have hurt him and his.He sang the world.It was a good song, and it was his song. Sometimes it had words, and sometimes it didn't have any words at all.As he sang, all the creatures listening began to clap and to stamp and to hum along; Charlie felt like he was the conduit for a great song that took in all of them. He sang of birds, of the magic of looking up and seeing them in flight, of the sheen of the sun on a wing feather in the morning.The totem creatures were dancing now, the dances of their kind. The Bird Woman danced the wheeling dance of birds, fanning her tail feathers, tossing back her beak.There was only one creature on the mountainside who did not dance.Tiger lashed his tail. He was not clapping or singing or dancing. His face was bruised purple, and his body was covered in welts and in bite marks. He had padded down the rocks, a step at a time, until he was close to Charlie. ""The songs aren't yours,"" he growled.Charlie looked at him, and sang about Tiger, and about Grahame Coats, and those who would prey upon the innocent. He turned: Spider was looking up at him with admiration. Tiger roared in anger, and Charlie took the roar and wound his song around it. Then he did the roar himself, just like Tiger had done it. Well, the roar began just as Tiger's roar had, but then Charlie changed it, so it became a really goofy sort of roar, and all the creatures watching from the rocks started to laugh. They couldn't help it. Charlie did the goofy roar again. Like any impersonation, like any perfect caricature, it had the effect of making what it made fun of intrinsically ridiculous. No one would ever hear Tiger roar again without hearing Charlie's roar underneath it. ""Goofy sort of a roar,"" they'd say.Tiger turned his back on Charlie. He loped through the crowd, roaring as he ran, which only made the crowd laugh the harder. Tiger angrily retreated back into his cave.Spider gestured with his hands, a curt movement.There was a rumble, and the mouth of Tiger's cave collapsed in a small rock slide. Spider looked satisfied. Charlie kept singing.He sang the song of Rosie Noah and the song of Rosie's mother: he sang a long life for Mrs. Noah and all the happiness that she deserved.He sang of his life, all of their lives, and in his song he saw the pattern of their lives as a web that a fly had blundered into, and with his song he wrapped the fly, made certain it would not escape, and he repaired the web with new strands.And now the song was coming to its natural end.Charlie realized, with no little surprise, that he enjoyed singing to other people, and he knew, at that moment, that this was what he would spend the rest of his life doing. He would sing: not big, magical songs that made worlds or recreated existence. Just small songs that would make people happy for a breath, make them move, make them for a little while, forget their problems. And he knew that there would always be the fear before performing, the stage fright, that would never go away, but he also understood that it would be like jumping into a swimming pool - only uncomfortably chill for a few seconds - and then the discomfort would pass and it would be good-.Never this good. Never this good again. But good enough.And then he was done. Charlie hung his head. The creatures on the cliff top let the last notes die away, stopped stamping, stopped clapping, stopped dancing. Charlie took off his father's green fedora and fanned his face with it.Under his breath, Spider said, ""That was amazing.""""You could have done it too,"" said Charlie.""I don't think so. What was happening at the end? I felt you doing something, but I couldn't really tell what it was.""""I fixed things,"" said Charlie. ""For us. I think. I'm not really sure-."" And he wasn't. Now the song was over, the content of the song was unraveling like a dream in the morning.He pointed to the cave mouth that was blocked by rocks. ""Did you do that?""""Yeah,"" said Spider. ""Seemed the least I could do. Tiger will dig his way out eventually, though. I wish I'd done something worse than just shut the door on him, to be honest.""""Not to worry,"" said Charlie. ""I did. Something much worse.""He watched the animals disperse. His father was nowhere to be seen, which did not surprise him. ""Come on,"" he said. ""We ought to be getting back.""Spider went back to see Rosie at visiting time. He was carrying a large box of chocolates, the largest that the hospital gift shop sold.""For you,"" he said.""Thanks.""""They told me,"" she said, ""that they think my mum's going to pull through. Apparently she opened her eyes and asked for porridge. The doctor said it's a miracle.""""Yup. Your mother asking for food. Certainly sounds like a miracle to me.""She swatted his arm with her hand, then left her hand resting on his arm.""You know,"" she said, after a while, ""You're going to think this is silly of me. But when I was in the dark, with Mum, I thought that you were helping me. I felt like you were keeping the beast at bay. That if you hadn't've done what you were doing, he would have killed us.""""Um. I probably helped.""""Really?""""I don't know. I think so. I was in trouble as well, and I thought about you.""""Were you in very big trouble?""""Enormous. Yes.""""Will you pour me a glass of water, please?""He did. She said, ""Spider, what do you do?""""Do?""""For a job.""""Whatever I feel like doing.""""I think,"" she said, ""I may stay here, for a bit. The nurses have been telling me how much they need teachers here. I'd like to see that I was making a difference.""""That might be fun.""""And what would you do, if I did?""""Oh. Well, if you were here, I'm sure I could find something to keep me busy.""Their fingers twined, tight as a ship's knot.""Do you think we can make this work?"" she asked.""I think so,"" said Spider, soberly. ""And if I get bored with you, I'll just go away and do something else. So not to worry.""""Oh,"" said Rosie, ""I'm not worried."" And she wasn't. There was steel in her voice beneath the softness. You could tell where her mother got it from.Charlie found Daisy on a deck chair out on the beach. He thought she was asleep in the sun. When his shadow touched her, she said, ""Hello Charlie."" She didn't open her eyes.""How did you know it was me?""""Your hat smells like a cigar. Are you going to be getting rid of it soon?""""No,"" said Charlie. ""I told you. Family heirloom. I plan to wear it till I die, then leave it to my children. So. Do you still have a job with the police force?""""Sort of,"" she said. ""My boss said that it's been decided that what I was suffering from was nervous exhaustion brought on by overwork, and I'm on sick leave until I feel well enough to come back.""""Ah. And when will that be?""""Not sure,"" she said. ""Can you pass the suntan oil?""He had a box in his pocket. He took it out and put it on the arm of the deck chair. ""In a minute. Er."" He paused. ""You know,"" he said, ""we've already done the big embarrassing one of these at gunpoint."" He opened the box. ""But this is for you, from me. Well, Rosie returned it to me. And we can swap it for one you like. Pick out a different one. Probably it won't even fit. But it's yours. If you want it. And um. Me.""She reached into the box and took out the engagement ring.""Hmph. All right,"" she said. ""As long as you're not just doing it to get the lime back.""Tiger prowled. His tail lashed irritably from side to side as he paced back and forth across the mouth of his cave. His eyes burned like emerald torches in the shadows.""Whole world and everything used to be mine,"" said Tiger. ""Moon and stars and sun and stories. I owned them all.""""I feel it incumbent on me to point out,"" said a small voice from the back of the cave, ""that you said that already.""Tiger paused in his pacing; he turned then and insinuated himself into the back of his cave, rippling as he walked, like a fur rug over hydraulic springs. He padded back until he came to the carcass of an ox, and he said, in a quiet voice, ""I beg your pardon.""There was a scrabbling from inside the carcass. The tip of a nose protruded from the rib cage. ""Actually,"" it said, ""I was, so to speak, agreeing with you. That was what I was doing.""Little white hands pulled a thin strip of dried meat from between two ribs, revealing a small animal the color of dirty snow. It might have been an albino mongoose, or perhaps some particularly shifty kind of weasel in its winter coat. It had a scavenger's eyes.""Whole world and everything used to be mine. Moon and stars and sun and stories. I owned them all."" Then he said, ""Would have been mine again.""Tiger stared down at the little beast. Then, without warning, one huge paw descended, smashing the rib cage, breaking the carcass into foul-smelling fragments, pinning the little animal to the floor; it wriggled and writhed, but it could not escape.""You are here,"" said Tiger, his huge head nose to nose with the pale animal's tiny head, ""you are here under my sufferance. Do you understand that? Because the next time you say something irritating, I shall bite your head off.""""Mmmph,"" said the weasely thing.""You wouldn't like it if I bit off your head, would you?""""Nngk,"" said the smaller animal. Its eyes were a pale blue, two chips of ice, and they glinted as it twisted uncomfortably beneath the weight of the huge paw.""So will you promise me that you will behave, and you will be quiet?"" rumbled Tiger. He lifted his paw a little to allow the beast to speak.""Indeedy,"" said the small white thing, extremely politely. Then, with one weasely movement, it twisted and sank its sharp little teeth into Tiger's paw. Tiger bellowed in pain, whipped the paw back, sending the little animal flying through the air. It struck the rock ceiling, bounced over to a ledge, and from there it darted, like a dirty white streak, to the very back of the cave, where the ceiling got low and close to the floor, and where there were many hiding places for a small animal, places a larger animal could not go.Tiger padded as far back into the cave as it could easily walk. ""You think I can't wait?"" he asked. ""You have to come out sooner or later. I'm not going anywhere."" Tiger lay down. He closed his eyes and soon began to make fairly convincing snoring noises.After about half an hour of snoring from Tiger, the pale animal crept out from the rocks and slipped from shadow to shadow, making for a large bone that still had plenty of good meat on it, if you didn't mind a certain rankness, and it didn't. Still, to get to the bone, it would have to pass the great beast. It lurked in the shadows, then it ventured out on little silent feet.As it passed the sleeping Tiger, a forepaw shot out, and a claw slammed down on the creature's tail, pinning it down. Another paw held the little creature behind the neck. The great cat opened its eyes. ""Frankly,"" it said, ""we appear to be stuck with each other. So all I'm asking is that you make an effort. We can both make an effort. I rather doubt that we'll ever be friends, but perhaps we could learn to tolerate each other.""""I take your point,"" said the small ferretty thing. ""Needs must, as they say, when the Devil drives.""""That's an example of what I'm saying,"" said Tiger. ""You just have to learn when to keep your mouth shut.""""It's an ill wind,"" said the little animal, ""that blows nobody any good.""""Now you're irritating me again,"" said Tiger. ""I'm trying to tell you. Don't irritate me, and I won't bite off your head.""""You keep using the phrase 'bite my head off.' Now when you say 'bite my head off,' I take it I can assume that this is actually some kind of metaphorical statement, implying that you'll shout at me, perhaps rather angrily?""""Bite your head off. Then crunch it. Then chew it. Then swallow it,"" said Tiger. ""Neither of us can leave until Anansi's child forgets we're here. The way that bastard seems to have arranged things, even if I kill you in the morning you'll be reincarnated back in this blasted cave by the end of the afternoon. So don't irritate me.""The small white animal said, ""Ah well. Another day - """"If you say 'another dollar,' "" said Tiger, ""I will be irritated, and there will be serious consequences. Don't. Say anything. Irritating. Do you understand?""There was a brief silence in the cave at the end of the world. It was broken by a small, weasely voice saying, ""Absatively.""It started to say, ""Oww!"" but the noise was suddenly and effectively silenced.And then there was nothing in that place but the sound of crunching.The thing they don't tell you about coffins in the literature, because frankly it's not much of a selling point to the people who are buying them, is just how comfortable they are.Mr. Nancy was extremely satisfied with his coffin. Now that all the excitement was over, he'd gone back to his coffin and was comfortably dozing. Every once in a while he would wake and remember where he was, then he'd roll over and go back to sleep.The grave, as has been pointed out, is a fine place, not to mention a private one, and is thus an excellent place to get a little downtime. Six feet down, best kind there is. Another twenty years or so, he thought, and he would have to think about getting up.He opened one eye when the funeral started.He could hear them up above him: Callyanne Higgler and the Bustamonte woman and the other one, the thin one, not to mention a small horde of grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren, all of them sighing and wailing and crying their eyes out for the late Mrs. Dunwiddy.Mr. Nancy thought about pushing one hand up through the turf and grabbing Callyanne Higgler's ankle. It was something he'd wanted to do ever since he saw Carrie at a drive-in, thirty years earlier, but now that the opportunity presented itself, he found himself able to resist the temptation. Honestly, he couldn't be bothered. She'd only scream and have a heart attack and die, and then the damn Garden of Rest would get even more crowded than it already was.Too much like hard work, anyway. There were good dreams to be dreamed in the world beneath the soil. Twenty years, he thought. Maybe twenty-five. By that time, he might even have grandchildren. It's always interesting to see how the grandchildren turn out.He could hear Callyanne Higgler wailing and carrying on up above him. Then she stopped her sobbing long enough to announce, ""Still. It's not as if she don't have a good life and a long one. That woman's a hundred and three years old when she passes from us.""""Hunnert and four!"" said an irritated voice from under the ground beside him.Mr. Nancy reached one insubstantial arm out and tapped the new coffin sharply on the side. ""Keep it down, there, woman,"" he barked. ""Some of us is tryin' to sleep.""Rosie had made it clear to Spider that she expected him to get a steady job, the kind that involved getting up in the morning and going somewhere.So one morning, the day before Rosie was to be discharged from the hospital, Spider got up early and went down to the town library. He logged on to the library computer, sauntered onto the Internet and, very carefully, cleared out all Grahame Coats's remaining bank accounts, the ones that the police forces of several continents had so far failed to find. He arranged for the stud farm in Argentina to be sold. He bought a small, off-the-peg company, endowed it with the money, and applied for charitable status. He sent off an e-mail, in the name of Roger Bronstein, hiring a lawyer to administer the foundation's business, and suggested that the lawyer might wish to seek out Miss Rosie Noah, late of London, currently of Saint Andrews, and hire her to Do Good.Rosie was hired. Her first task was to find office space.Following this, Spider spent four full days walking (and, at nights, sleeping on) the beach that circled most of the island, tasting the food in each of the dining establishments he encountered along the way until he came to Dawson's Fish Shack. He tried the fried flying fish, the boiled green figs, the grilled chicken, and the coconut pie, then he went back into the kitchen and found the chef, who was also the owner, and offered him money enough for partnership and cooking lessons.Dawson's Fish Shack is now a restaurant, and Mr. Dawson has retired. Sometimes Spider's out front and sometimes he's back in the kitchen: you go down there and look for him, you'll see him. The food is the best on the island. He's fatter than he used to be, though not as fat as he'll wind up if he keeps tasting everything he cooks.Not that Rosie minds.She does some teaching, and some helping out, and a lot of Doing Good, and if she ever misses London she never lets it show. Rosie's mother, on the other hand, misses London continually and vocally, but takes any suggestion that she might want to return there as an attempt to part her from her as-yet-unborn (and, for that matter, unconceived) grandchildren.Nothing would give this author greater pleasure than to be able to assure you that, following her return from the valley of the shadow of death, Rosie's mother became a new person, a jolly woman with a kind word for everyone, that her newfound appetite for food was only matched by her appetite for life and all if had to offer. Alas, respect for the truth compels perfect honesty and the truth is that when she came out of hospital Rosie's mother was still herself, just as suspicious and uncharitable as ever, although significantly more frail and now given to sleeping with the light on.She announced that she would be selling her flat in London and would move to wherever in the world Spider and Rosie were, to be near her grandchildren; and, as time went on, she would drop pointed comments about the lack of grandchildren, the quantity and motility of Spider's spermatozoa, the frequency and positions of Spider and Rosie's sexual relations, and the relative cheapness and ease of in vitro fertilization, to the point where Spider seriously began to think about not going to bed with Rosie anymore, just to spite Rosie's mother. He thought about this for about eleven seconds one afternoon, while Rosie's mother was handing them photocopies of an article from a magazine that she had found which suggested that Rosie should stand on her head for half an hour after sex; and he mentioned these thoughts to Rosie that night, and she laughed and told him that her mother wasn't allowed in their bedroom anyway, and that she wasn't going to be standing on her head after making love for anybody.Mrs. Noah has a flat in Williamstown, near Spider and Rosie's house, and twice a week one of Callyanne Higgler's many nieces looks in on her, does the vacuuming, dusts the glass fruit (the wax fruit melted in the island heat), and makes a little food and leaves it in the fridge, and sometimes Rosie's mum eats it and sometimes she doesn't.Charlie's a singer these days. He's lost a lot of the softness. He's a lean man now, with a trademark fedora hat. He has lots of different fedoras, in different colors; his favorite one is green.Charlie has a son. His name is Marcus: he is four and a half and possesses that deep gravity and seriousness that only small children and mountain gorillas have ever been able to master.Nobody ever calls Charlie ""Fat Charlie"" anymore, and honestly, sometimes he misses it.It was early in the morning in the summer, and it was already light. There was already noise coming from the room next door. Charlie let Daisy sleep. He climbed out of bed quietly, grabbed a T-shirt and shorts, and went through the door to see his son naked on the floor playing with a small wooden train set. Together they pulled on their T-shirts and shorts and flip-flops, and Charlie put on a hat, and they walked down to the beach.""Daddy?"" said the boy. His jaw was set, and he seemed to be pondering something.""Yes, Marcus?""""Who was the shortest president?""""You mean in height?""""No. In, in days. Who was the shortest.""""Harrison. He caught pneumonia during his inauguration and died. He was president for forty-something days, and he spent most of his time in office dying.""""Oh. Well, who was the longest then?""""Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He served three full terms. Died in office during his fourth. We'll take off our shoes here.""They placed their shoes on a rock and carried on walking down toward the waves, their toes digging into the damp sand.""How do you know so much about presidents?""""Because my father thought it would do me good to find out about them, when I was a kid.""""Oh.""They waded out into the water, making for a boulder, one that could only be seen at low tide. After a while, Charlie picked the boy up and let him ride on his shoulders.""Daddy?""""Yes, Marcus.""""P'choona says you're famous.""""And who's Petunia?""""At playgroup. She says her mom has all your CDs. She says she loves your singing.""""Ah.""""Are you famous?""""Not really. A little bit."" He put Marcus down on the top of the boulder, then he clambered up it himself. ""Okay. Ready to sing?""""Yes.""""What do you want to sing?""""My favorite song.""""I don't know if she'll like that one.""""She will."" Marcus had the certainty of walls, of mountains.""Okay. One, two, three-""They sang ""Yellow Bird"" together, which was Marcus's favorite song that week, and then they sang ""Zombie Jamboree,"" which was his second favorite, and ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain,"" which was his third favorite. Marcus, whose eyes were better than Charlie's, spotted her as they were finishing ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain"" and he began to wave.""There she is, Daddy.""""Are you sure?""The morning haze blurred the sea and sky together into a pale whiteness, and Charlie squinted at the horizon. ""I don't see anything.""""She's gone under the water. She'll be here soon.""There was a splash, and she surfaced immediately below them; with a reach and a flip and a wiggle she was sitting on the rock beside them, her silvery tail dangling down into the Atlantic, flicking beads of water up onto her scales. She had long, orange-red hair.They all sang together now, the man and the boy and the mermaid. They sang ""The Lady Is a Tramp"" and ""Yellow Submarine"" and then Marcus taught the mermaid the words to the Flintstones theme song.""He reminds me of you,"" she said to Charlie, ""when you were a little boy.""""You knew me then?""She smiled. ""You and your father used to walk down the beach, back then. Your father,"" she said. ""He was quite some gentleman."" She sighed. Mermaids sigh better than anyone. Then she said, ""You should go back now. The tide's coming in."" She pushed her long hair back and jackknifed into the ocean. She raised her head above the waves, touched her fingertips to her lips, and blew Marcus a kiss before vanishing under the water.Charlie put his son onto his shoulders, and he waded through the sea, back to the beach, where his son slipped down from his shoulders onto the sand. He took off his old fedora hat and placed it on his son's head. It was much too big for the boy, but it still made him smile.""Hey,"" said Charlie, ""You want to see something?""""Okay. But I want breakfast. I want pancakes. No, I want oatmeal. No, I want pancakes.""""Watch this."" Charlie began to do a sand-dance in his bare feet, soft-shoe shuffling through the sand.""I can do that,"" said Marcus.""Really?""""Watch me, Daddy.""He could, too.Together the man and the boy danced their way back up the sand to the house, singing a wordless song that they made up as they went along, which lingered in the air even after they had gone in for breakfast.

The boundaries of our country, sir? Why sir, onto the north we are bounded by the Aurora Borealis, on the east we are bounded by the rising sun, on the south we are bounded by the procession of the Equinoxes, and on the west by the Day of Judgement. 
-THE AMERICAN JOE MILLER'S JEST BOOK
 
Shadow had done three years in prison. He was big enough, and looked don't-fuck-with-me enough that his biggest problem was killing time. So he kept himself in shape, and taught himself coin tricks, and thought a lot about how much he loved his wife.
The best thing-in Shadow's opinion, perhaps the only good thing-about being in prison was a feeling of relief. The feeling that he'd plunged as low as he could plunge and he'd hit bottom. He didn't worry that the man was going to get him, because the man had got him. He did not awake in prison with a feeling of dread; he was no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, because yesterday had brought it.
It did not matter, Shadow decided, if you had done what you had been convicted of or not. In his experience everyone he met in prison was aggrieved about something: there was always something the authorities had got wrong, something they said you did when you didn't-or you didn't do quite like they said you did. What was important was that they had got you.
He had noticed it in the first few days, when everything, from the slang to the bad food, was new. Despite the misery and the utter skin-crawling horror of incarceration, he was breathing relief.
Shadow tried not to talk too much. Somewhere around the middle of year two he mentioned his theory to Low Key Lyesmith, his cellmate.
Low Key, who was a grifter from Minnesota, smiled his scarred smile. ""Yeah,"" he said. ""That's true. It's even better when you've been sentenced to death. That's when you remember the jokes about the guys who kicked their boots off as the noose flipped around their necks, because their friends always told them they'd die with their boots on.""
""Is that a joke?"" asked Shadow.
""Damn right. Gallows humor. Best kind there is-bang, the worst has happened. You get a few days for it to sink in, then you're riding the cart on your way to do the dance on nothing.""
""When did they last hang a man in this state?"" asked Shadow.
""How the hell should I know?"" Lyesmith kept his orange-blond hair pretty much shaved. You could see the lines of his skull. ""Tell you what, though. This country started going to hell when they stopped hanging folks. No gallows dirt. No gallows deals.""
Shadow shrugged. He could see nothing romantic in a death sentence.
If you didn't have a death sentence, he decided, then prison was, at best, only a temporary reprieve from life, for two reasons. First, life creeps back into prison. There are always places to go further down, even when you've been taken off the board; life goes on, even if it's life under a microscope or life in a cage. And second, if you just hang in there, some day they're going to have to let you out.
In the beginning it was too far away for Shadow to focus on. Then it became a distant beam of hope, and he learned how to tell himself ""this too shall pass"" when the prison shit went down, as prison shit always did. One day the magic door would open and he'd walk through it. So he marked off the days on his Songbirds of North America calendar, which was the only calendar they sold in the prison commissary, and the sun went down and he didn't see it and the sun came up and he didn't see it. He practiced coin tricks from a book he found in the wasteland of the prison library; and he worked out; and he made lists in his head of what he'd do when he got out of prison.
Shadow's lists got shorter and shorter. After two years he had it down to three things.
First, he was going to take a bath. A real, long, serious soak, in a tub with bubbles in it. Maybe read the paper, maybe not. Some days he thought one way, some days the other.
Second he was going to towel himself off, put on a robe. Maybe slippers. He liked the idea of slippers. If he smoked he would be smoking a pipe about now, but he didn't smoke. He would pick up his wife in his arms (""Puppy,"" she would squeal in mock horror and real delight, ""what are you doing?""). He would carry her into the bedroom, and close the door. They'd call out for pizzas if they got hungry.
Third, after he and Laura had come out of the bedroom, maybe a couple of days later, he was going to keep his head down and stay out of trouble for the rest of his life.
""And then you'll be happy?"" asked Low Key Lyesmith. That day they were working in the prison shop, assembling bird feeders, which was barely more interesting than stamping out license plates.
""Call no man happy,"" said Shadow, ""until he is dead.""
""Herodotus,"" said Low Key. ""Hey. You're learning.""
""Who the fuck's Herodotus?"" asked the Iceman, slotting together the sides of a bird feeder, and passing it to Shadow, who bolted and screwed it tight.
""Dead Greek,"" said Shadow.
""My last girlfriend was Greek,"" said the Iceman. ""The shit her family ate. You would not believe. Like rice wrapped in leaves. Shit like that.""
The Iceman was the same size and shape as a Coke machine, with blue eyes and hair so blond it was almost white. He had beaten the crap out of some guy who had made the mistake of copping a feel off his girlfriend in the bar where she danced and the Iceman bounced. The guy's friends had called the police, who arrested the Iceman and ran a check on him, which revealed that the Iceman had walked from a work-release program eighteen months earlier.
""So what was I supposed to do?"" asked the Iceman, aggrieved, when he had told Shadow the whole sad tale. ""I'd told him she was my girlfriend. Was I supposed to let him disrespect me like that? Was I? I mean, he had his hands all over her.""
Shadow had said something meaningless, like ""You tell 'em,"" and left it at that. One thing he had learned early, you do your own time in prison. You don't do anyone else's time for them.
Keep your head down. Do your own time.
Lyesmith had loaned Shadow a battered paperback copy of Herodotus's Histories several months earlier. ""It's not boring. It's cool,"" he said, when Shadow protested that he didn't read books. ""Read it first, then tell me it's cool.""
Shadow had made a face, but he had started to read, and had found himself hooked against his will.
""Greeks,"" said the Iceman, with disgust. ""And it ain't true what they say about them, neither. I tried giving it to my girlfriend in the ass, she almost clawed my eyes out.""
Lyesmith was transferred one day, without warning. He left Shadow his copy of Herodotus with several actual coins hidden in the pages: two quarters, a penny, and a nickel. Coins were contraband: you can sharpen the edges against a stone, slice open someone's face in a fight. Shadow didn't want a weapon; Shadow just wanted something to do with his hands.
Shadow was not superstitious. He did not believe in anything he could not see. Still, he could feel disaster hovering above the prison in those final weeks, just as he had felt it in the days before the robbery. There was a hollowness in the pit of his stomach, which he told himself was simply a fear of going back to the world on the outside. But he could not be sure. He was more paranoid than usual, and in prison usual is very, and is a survival skill. Shadow became more quiet, more shadowy, than ever. He found himself watching the body language of the guards, of the other inmates, searching for a clue to the bad thing that was going to happen, as he was certain that it would.
A month before he was due to be released. Shadow sat in a chilly office, facing a short man with a port-wine birthmark on his forehead. They sat across a desk from each other; the man had Shadow's file open in front of him, and was holding a ballpoint pen. The end of the pen was badly chewed.
""You cold, Shadow?""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""A little.""
The man shrugged. ""That's the system,"" he said. ""Furnaces don't go on until December the first. Then they go off March the first. I don't make the rules."" Social niceties done with, he ran his forefinger down the sheet of paper stapled to the inside-left of the folder. ""You're thirty-two years old?""
""Yes, sir.""
""You look younger.""
""Clean living.""
""Says here you've been a model inmate.""
""I learned my lesson, sir.""
""Did you? Did you really?"" He looked at Shadow intently, the birthmark on his forehead lowering. Shadow thought about telling the man some of his theories about prison, but he said nothing. He nodded, instead, and concentrated on appearing properly remorseful.
""Says here you've got a wife, Shadow.""
""Her name's Laura.""
""How's everything there?""
""Pretty good. She got kind of mad at me when I was arrested. But she's come down to see me as much as she could-it's a long way to travel. We write and I call her when I can.""
""What does your wife do?""
""She's a travel agent. Sends people all over the world.""
""How'd you meet her?""
Shadow could not decide why the man was asking. He considered telling him it was none of his business, then said, ""She was my best buddy's wife's best friend. They set us up on a blind date. We hit it off.""
""And you've got a job waiting for you?""
""Yessir. My buddy, Robbie, the one I just told you about, he owns the Muscle Farm, the place I used to train. He says my old job is waiting for me.""
An eyebrow raised. ""Really?""
""Says he figures I'll be a big draw. Bring back some old-timers, and pull in the tough crowd who want to be tougher.""
The man seemed satisfied. He chewed the end of his ballpoint pen, then turned over the sheet of paper.
""How do you feel about your offense?""
Shadow shrugged. ""I was stupid,"" he said, and meant it.
The man with the birthmark sighed. He ticked off a number of items on a checklist. Then he riffled through the papers in Shadow's file. ""How're you getting home from here?"" he asked. ""Greyhound?""
""Flying home. It's good to have a wife who's a travel agent.""
The man frowned, and the birthmark creased. ""She sent you a ticket?""
""Didn't need to. Just sent me a confirmation number. Electronic ticket. All I have to do is turn up at the airport in a month and show 'em my ID, and I'm outta here.""
The man nodded, scribbled one final note, then he closed the file and put down the ballpoint pen. Two pale hands rested on the gray desk like pink animals. He brought his hands close together, made a steeple of his forefingers, and stared at Shadow with watery hazel eyes.
""You're lucky,"" he said. ""You have someone to go back to, you got a job waiting. You can put all this behind you. You got a second chance. Make the most of it.""
The man did not offer to shake Shadow's hand as he rose to leave, nor did Shadow expect him to.
The last week was the worst. In some ways it was worse than the whole three years put together. Shadow wondered if it was the weather: oppressive, still and cold. It felt as if a storm was on the way, but the storm never came. He had the jitters and the heebie-jeebies, a feeling deep in his stomach that something was entirely wrong. In the exercise yard the wind gusted. Shadow imagined that he could smell snow on the air.
He called his wife collect. Shadow knew that the phone companies whacked a three-dollar surcharge on every call made from a prison phone. That's why operators are always real polite to people calling from prisons, Shadow had decided: they knew that he paid their wages.
""Something feels weird,"" he told Laura. That wasn't the first thing he said to her. The first thing was ""I love you,"" because it's a good thing to say if you can mean it, and Shadow did.
""Hello,"" said Laura. ""I love you too. What feels weird?""
""I don't know,"" he said. ""Maybe the weather. It feels like if we could only get a storm, everything would be okay.""
""It's nice here,"" she said. ""The last of the leaves haven't quite fallen. If we don't get a storm, you'll be able to see them when you get home.""
""Five days,"" said Shadow.
""A hundred and twenty hours, and then you come home,"" she said.
""Everything okay there? Nothing wrong?""
""Everything's fine. I'm seeing Robbie tonight. We're planning your surprise welcome-home party.""
""Surprise party?""
""Of course. You don't know anything about it, do you?""
""Not a thing.""
""That's my husband,"" she said. Shadow realized that he was smiling. He had been inside for three years, but she could still make him smile.
""Love you, babes,"" said Shadow.
""Love you, puppy,"" said Laura.
Shadow put down the phone.
When they got married Laura told Shadow that she wanted a puppy, but their landlord had pointed out they weren't allowed pets under the terms of their lease. ""Hey,"" Shadow had said, ""I'll be your puppy. What do you want me to do? Chew your slippers? Piss on the kitchen floor? Lick your nose? Sniff your crotch? I bet there's nothing a puppy can do I can't do!"" And he picked her up as if she weighed nothing at all, and began to lick her nose while she giggled and shrieked, and then he carried her to the bed.
In the food hall Sam Fetisher sidled over to Shadow and smiled, showing his old teeth. He sat down beside Shadow and began to eat his macaroni and cheese.
""We got to talk,"" said Sam Fetisher.
Sam Fetisher was one of the blackest men that Shadow had ever seen. He might have been sixty. He might have been eighty. Then again, Shadow had met thirty-year-old crack heads who looked older than Sam Fetisher.
""Mm?"" said Shadow.
""Storm's on the way,"" said Sam.
""Feels like it,"" said Shadow. ""Maybe it'll snow soon.""
""Not that kind of storm. Bigger storms than that coming. I tell you, boy, you're better off in here than out on the street when the big storm comes.""
""Done my time,"" said Shadow. ""Friday, I'm gone.""
Sam Fetisher stared at Shadow. ""Where you from?"" he asked.
""Eagle Point. Indiana.""
""You're a lying fuck,"" said Sam Fetisher. ""I mean originally. Where are your folks from?""
""Chicago,"" said Shadow. His mother had lived in Chicago as a girl, and she had died there, half a lifetime ago.
""Like I said. Big storm coming. Keep your head down, Shadow-boy. It's like...what do they call those things continents ride around on? Some kind of plates?""
""Tectonic plates?"" Shadow hazarded.
""That's it. Tectonic plates. It's like when they go riding, when North America goes skidding into South America, you don't want to be in the middle. You dig me?""
""Not even a little.""
One brown eye closed in a slow wink. ""Hell, don't say I didn't warn you,"" said Sam Fetisher, and he spooned a trembling lump of orange Jell-O into his mouth.
Shadow spent the night half-awake, drifting in and out of sleep, listening to his new cellmate grunt and snore in the bunk below him. Several cells away a man whined and howled and sobbed like an animal, and from time to time someone would scream at him to shut the fuck up. Shadow tried not to hear. He let the empty minutes wash over him, lonely and slow.
Two days to go. Forty-eight hours, starting with oatmeal and prison coffee and a guard named Wilson who tapped Shadow harder than he had to on the shoulder and said, ""Shadow? This way.""
Shadow checked his conscience. It was quiet, which did not, he had observed, in a prison, mean that he was not in deep shit. The two men walked more or less side by side, feet echoing on metal and concrete.
Shadow tasted fear in the back of his throat, bitter as old coffee. The bad thing was happening...
There was a voice in the back of his head whispering that they were going to slap another year onto his sentence, drop him into solitary, cut off his hands, cut off his head. He told himself he was being stupid, but his heart was pounding fit to burst out of his chest.
""I don't get you, Shadow,"" said Wilson, as they walked.
""What's not to get, sir?""
""You. You're too fucking quiet. Too polite. You wait like the old guys, but you're what? Twenty-five? Twenty-eight?""
""Thirty-two, sir.""
""And what are you? A spic? A gypsy?""
""Not that I know of, sir. Maybe.""
""Maybe you got nigger blood in you. You got nigger blood in you, Shadow?""
""Could be, sir."" Shadow stood tall and looked straight ahead, and concentrated on not allowing himself to be riled by this man.
""Yeah? Well, all I know is, you fucking spook me."" Wilson had sandy blond hair and a sandy blond face and a sandy blond smile. ""You leaving us soon?""
""Hope so, sir.""
""You'll be back. I can see it in your eyes. You're a fuckup, Shadow. Now, if I had my way, none of you assholes would ever get out. We'd drop you in the hole and forget you.""
Oubliettes, thought Shadow, and he said nothing. It was a survival thing: he didn't answer back, didn't say anything about job security for prison guards, debate the nature of repentance, rehabilitation, or rates of recidivism. He didn't say anything funny or clever, and, to be on the safe side, when he was talking to a prison official, whenever possible, he didn't say anything at all. Speak when you're spoken to. Do your own time. Get out. Get home. Have a long hot bath. Tell Laura you love her. Rebuild a life.
They walked through a couple of checkpoints. Wilson showed his ID each time. Up a set of stairs, and they were standing outside the prison warden's office. Shadow had never been there before, but he knew what it was. It had the prison warden's name-G. Patterson-on the door in black letters, and beside the door, a miniature traffic light.
The top light burned red.
Wilson pressed a button below the traffic light.
They stood there in silence for a couple of minutes. Shadow tried to tell himself that everything was all right, that on Friday morning he'd be on the plane up to Eagle Point, but he did not believe it himself.
The red light went out and the green light went on, and Wilson opened the door. They went inside.
Shadow had seen the warden a handful of times in the last three years. Once he had been showing a politician around; Shadow had not recognized the man. Once, during a lock-down, the warden had spoken to them in groups of a hundred, telling them that the prison was over-crowded, and that, since it would remain overcrowded, they had better get used to it. This was Shadow's first time up close to the man.
Up close, Patterson looked worse. His face was oblong, with gray hair cut into a military bristle cut. He smelled of Old Spice. Behind him was a shelf of books, each with the word prison in the title; his desk was perfectly clean, empty but for a telephone and a tear-off-the-pages Far Side calendar. He had a hearing aid in his right ear.
""Please, sit down.""
Shadow sat down at the desk, noting the civility.
Wilson stood behind him.
The warden opened a desk drawer and took out a file, placed it on his desk.
""Says here you were sentenced to six years for aggravated assault and battery. You've served three years. You were due to be released on Friday.""
Were? Shadow felt his stomach lurch inside him. He wondered how much longer he was going to have to serve-another year? Two years? All three? All he said was ""Yes, sir.""
The warden licked his lips. ""What did you say?""
""I said, 'Yes, sir.'""
""Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon. You'll be getting out a couple of days early."" The warden said this with no joy, as if he were intoning a death sentence. Shadow nodded, and he waited for the other shoe to drop. The warden looked down at the paper on his desk. ""This came from the Johnson Memorial Hospital in Eagle Point...Your wife. She died in the early hours of this morning. It was an automobile accident. I'm sorry.""
Shadow nodded once more.
Wilson walked him back to his cell, not saying anything. He unlocked the cell door and let Shadow in. Then he said, ""It's like one of them good-news, bad-news jokes, isn't it? Good news, we're letting you out early, bad news, your wife is dead."" He laughed, as if it were genuinely funny.
Shadow said nothing at all.
  
Numbly, he packed up his possessions, gave several away. He left behind Low Key's Herodotus and the book of coin tricks, and, with a momentary pang, he abandoned the blank metal disks he had smuggled out of the workshop which had, until he had found Low Key's change in the book, served him for coins. There would be coins, real coins, on the outside. He shaved. He dressed in civilian clothes. He walked through door after door, knowing that he would never walk back through them again, feeling empty inside.
The rain had started to gust from the gray sky, a freezing rain. Pellets of ice stung Shadow's face, while the rain soaked the thin overcoat as they walked away from the prison building, toward the yellow ex-school bus that would take them to the nearest city.
By the time they got to the bus they were soaked. Eight of them were leaving, Shadow thought. Fifteen hundred still inside. He sat on the bus and shivered until the heaters started working, wondering what he was doing, where he was going now.
Ghost images filled his head, unbidden. In his imagination he was leaving another prison, long ago.
He had been imprisoned in a lightless garret room for far too long: his beard was wild and his hair was a tangle. The guards had walked him down a gray stone stairway and out into a plaza filled with brightly colored things, with people and with objects. It was a market day and he was dazzled by the noise and the color, squinting at the sunlight that filled the square, smelling the salt-wet air and all the good things of the market, and on his left the sun glittered from the water....
The bus shuddered to a halt at a red light.
The wind howled about the bus, and the wipers slooshed heavily back and forth across the windshield, smearing the city into a red and yellow neon wetness. It was early afternoon, but it looked like night through the glass.
""Shit,"" said the man in the seat behind Shadow, rubbing the condensation from the window with his hand, staring at a wet figure hurrying down the sidewalk. ""There's pussy out there.""
Shadow swallowed. It occurred to him that he had not cried yet-had in fact felt nothing at all. No tears. No sorrow. Nothing.
He found himself thinking about a guy named Johnnie Larch he'd shared a cell with when he'd first been put inside, who told Shadow how he'd once got out after five years behind bars, with $100 and a ticket to Seattle, where his sister lived.
Johnnie Larch had got to the airport, and he handed his ticket to the woman on the counter, and she asked to see his driver's license.
He showed it to her. It had expired a couple of years earlier. She told him it was not valid as ID. He told her it might not be valid as a driver's license, but it sure as hell was fine identification, and it had a photo of him on it, and his height and his weight, and damn it, who else did she think he was, if he wasn't him?
She said she'd thank him to keep his voice down.
He told her to give him a fucking boarding pass, or she was going to regret it, and that he wasn't going to be disrespected. You don't let people disrespect you in prison.
Then she pressed a button, and a few moments later the airport security showed up, and they tried to persuade Johnnie Larch to leave the airport quietly, and he did not wish to leave, and there was something of an altercation.
The upshot of it all was that Johnnie Larch never actually made it to Seattle, and he spent the next couple of days in town in bars, and when his $100 was gone he held up a gas station with a toy gun for money to keep drinking, and the police finally picked him up for pissing in the street. Pretty soon he was back inside serving the rest of his sentence and a little extra for the gas station job.
And the moral of this story, according to Johnnie Larch, was this: don't piss off people who work in airports.
""Are you sure it's not something like 'kinds of behavior that work in a specialized environment, such as a prison, can fail to work and in fact become harmful when used outside such an environment'?"" said Shadow, when Johnnie Larch told him the story.
""No, listen to me, I'm telling you, man,"" said Johnnie Larch, ""don't piss off those bitches in airports.""
Shadow half-smiled at the memory. His own driver's license had several months still to go before it expired.
""Bus station! Everybody out!""
The building stank of piss and sour beer. Shadow climbed into a taxi and told the driver to take him to the airport. He told him that there was an extra five dollars if he could do it in silence. They made it in twenty minutes and the driver never said a word.
Then Shadow was stumbling through the brightly lit airport terminal. Shadow worried about the whole e-ticket business. He knew he had a ticket for a flight on Friday, but he didn't know if it would work today. Anything electronic seemed fundamentally magical to Shadow, and liable to evaporate at any moment. He liked things he could hold and touch.
Still, he had his wallet, back in his possession for the first time in three years, containing several expired credit cards and one Visa card which, he was pleasantly surprised to discover, didn't expire until the end of January. He had a reservation number. And, he realized, he had the certainty that once he got home everything would, somehow, be right once more. Laura would be fine again. Maybe it was some kind of scam to spring him a few days early. Or perhaps it was a simple mix-up: some other Laura Moon's body had been dragged from the highway wreckage.
Lightning flickered outside the airport, through the windows-walls. Shadow realized he was holding his breath, waiting for something. A distant boom of thunder. He exhaled.
A tired white woman stared at him from behind the counter.
""Hello,"" said Shadow. You're the first strange woman I've spoken to, in the flesh, in three years. ""I've got an e-ticket number. I was supposed to be traveling on Friday but I have to go today. There was a death in my family.""
""Mm. I'm sorry to hear that."" She tapped at the keyboard, stared at the screen, tapped again. ""No problem. I've put you on the three thirty. It may be delayed, because of the storm, so keep an eye on the screens. Checking any baggage?""
He held up a shoulder bag. ""I don't need to check this, do I?""
""No,"" she said. ""It's fine. Do you have any picture ID?""
Shadow showed her his driver's license. Then he assured her that no one had given him a bomb to take onto the plane, and she, in return, gave him a printed boarding pass. Then he passed through the metal detector while his bag went through the X-ray machine.
It was not a big airport, but the number of people wandering, just wandering, amazed him. He watched people put down bags casually, observed wallets stuffed into back pockets, saw purses put down, unwatched, under chairs. That was when he realized he was no longer in prison.
Thirty minutes to wait until boarding. Shadow bought a slice of pizza and burned his lip on the hot cheese. He took his change and went to the phones. Called Robbie at the Muscle Farm, but the machine answered.
""Hey, Robbie,"" said Shadow. ""They tell me that Laura's dead. They let me out early. I'm coming home.""
Then, because people do make mistakes, he'd seen it happen, he called home, and listened to Laura's voice.
""Hi,"" she said. ""I'm not here or I can't come to the phone. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. And have a good day.""
Shadow couldn't bring himself to leave a message.
He sat in a plastic chair by the gate, and held his bag so tight he hurt his hand.
He was thinking about the first time he had ever seen Laura. He hadn't even known her name then. She was Audrey Burton's friend. He had been sitting with Robbie in a booth at Chi-Chi's, talking about something, probably how one of the other trainers had just announced she was opening her own dance studio, when Laura had walked in a pace or so behind Audrey, and Shadow had found himself staring. She had long, chestnut hair and eyes so blue Shadow mistakenly thought she was wearing tinted contact lenses. She had ordered a strawberry daiquiri, and insisted that Shadow taste it, and laughed delightedly when he did.
Laura loved people to taste what she tasted.
He had kissed her good night, that night, and she had tasted of strawberry daiquiris, and he had never wanted to kiss anyone else again. A woman announced that his plane was boarding, and Shadow's row was the first to be called. He was in the very back, an empty seat beside him. The rain pattered continually against the side of the plane: he imagined small children tossing down dried peas by the handful from the skies.
As the plane took off he fell asleep.
Shadow was in a dark place, and the thing staring at him wore a buffalo's head, rank and furry with huge wet eyes. Its body was a man's body, oiled and slick.
""Changes are coming,"" said the buffalo without moving its lips. ""There are certain decisions that will have to be made.""
Firelight flickered from wet cave walls.
""Where am I?"" Shadow asked.
""In the earth and under the earth,"" said the buffalo man. ""You are where the forgotten wait."" His eyes were liquid black marbles, and his voice was a rumble from beneath the world. He smelled like wet cow. ""Believe,"" said the rumbling voice. ""If you are to survive, you must believe.""
""Believe what?"" asked Shadow. ""What should I believe?""
He stared at Shadow, the buffalo man, and he drew himself up huge, and his eyes filled with fire. He opened his spit-flecked buffalo mouth and it was red inside with the flames that burned inside him, under the earth.
""Everything,"" roared the buffalo man.
The world tipped and spun, and Shadow was on the plane once more; but the tipping continued. In the front of the plane a woman screamed, half-heartedly.
Lightning burst in blinding flashes around the plane. The captain came on the intercom to tell them that he was going to try and gain some altitude, to get away from the storm.
The plane shook and shuddered, and Shadow wondered, coldly and idly, if he was going to die. It seemed possible, he decided, but unlikely. He stared out of the window and watched the lightning illuminate the horizon.
Then he dozed once more, and dreamed he was back in prison, and Low Key had whispered to him in the food line that someone had put out a contract on his life, but that Shadow could not find out who or why; and when he woke up they were coming in for a landing.
He stumbled off the plane, blinking and waking.
All airports, he had long ago decided, look very much the same. It doesn't actually matter where you are, you are in an airport: tiles and walkways and restrooms, gates and newsstands and fluorescent lights. This airport looked like an airport. The trouble is, this wasn't the airport he was going to. This was a big airport, with way too many people, and way too many gates.
The people had the glazed, beaten look you only see in airports and prisons. If Hell is other people, thought Shadow, then Purgatory is airports.
""Excuse me, ma'am?""
The woman looked at him over the clipboard. ""Yes?""
""What airport is this?""
She looked at him, puzzled, trying to decide whether or not he was joking, then she said, ""St. Louis.""
""I thought this was the plane to Eagle Point.""
""It was. They redirected it here because of the storms. Didn't they make an announcement?""
""Probably. I fell asleep.""
""You'll need to talk to that man over there, in the red coat.""
The man was almost as tall as Shadow: he looked like the father from a seventies sitcom, and he tapped something into a computer and told Shadow to run-run!-to a gate on the far side of the terminal.
Shadow ran through the airport, but the doors were already closed when he got to the gate. He watched the plane pull away from the gate, through the plate glass. Then he explained his problem to the gate attendant (calmly, quietly, politely) and she sent him to a passenger assistance desk, where Shadow explained that he was on his way home after a long absence and his wife had just been killed in a road accident, and that it was vitally important that he went home now. He said nothing about prison.
The woman at the passenger assistance desk (short and brown, with a mole on the side of her nose) consulted with another woman and made a phone call (""Nope, that one's out. They've just cancelled it"") then she printed out another boarding card. ""This will get you there,"" she told him. ""We'll call ahead to the gate and tell them you're coming.""
Shadow felt like a pea being flicked between three cups, or a card being shuffled through a deck. Again he ran through the airport, ending up near where he had gotten off in the first place.
A small man at the gate took his boarding pass. ""We've been waiting for you,"" he confided, tearing off the stub of the boarding pass, with Shadow's seat assignment-17-D-on it. Shadow hurried onto the plane, and they closed the door behind him.
He walked through first class-there were only four first-class seats, three of which were occupied. The bearded man in a pale suit seated next to the unoccupied seat at the very front grinned at Shadow as he got onto the plane, then raised his wrist and tapped his watch as Shadow walked past.
Yeah, yeah, I'm making you late, thought Shadow. Let that be the worst of your worries.
The plane seemed pretty full, as he made his way down toward the back. Actually, Shadow quickly discovered, it was completely full, and there was a middle-aged woman sitting in seat 17-D. Shadow showed her his boarding card stub, and she showed him hers: they matched.
""Can you take your seat, please?"" asked the flight attendant.
""No,"" he said, ""I'm afraid I can't. This lady is sitting in it.""
She clicked her tongue and checked their boarding cards, then she led him back up to the front of the plane, and pointed him to the empty seat in first class. ""Looks like it's your lucky day,"" she told him.
Shadow sat down. ""Can I bring you something to drink?"" she asked him. ""We'll just have time before we take off. And I'm sure you need one after that.""
""I'd like a beer, please,"" said Shadow. ""Whatever you've got.""
The flight attendant went away.
The man in the pale suit in the seat beside Shadow put out his arm and tapped his watch with his fingernail. It was a black Rolex. ""You're late,"" said the man, and he grinned a huge grin with no warmth in it at all.
""Sorry?""
""I said, you're late.""
The flight attendant handed Shadow a glass of beer. He sipped it. For one moment, he wondered if the man was crazy, and then he decided he must have been referring to the plane, waiting for one last passenger.
""Sorry if I held you up,"" he said, politely. ""You in a hurry?""
The plane backed away from the gate. The flight attendant came back and took away Shadow's beer, half-finished. The man in the pale suit grinned at her and said, ""Don't worry, I'll hold on to this tightly,"" and she let him keep his glass of Jack Daniel's, while protesting, weakly, that it violated airline regulations. (""Let me be the judge of that, m'dear."")
""Time is certainly of the essence,"" said the man. ""But no, I am not in a hurry. I was merely concerned that you would not make the plane.""
""That was kind of you.""
The plane sat restlessly on the ground, engines throbbing, aching to be off.
""Kind my ass,"" said the man in the pale suit. ""I've got a job for you, Shadow.""
A roar of engines. The little plane jerked forward into a take-off, pushing Shadow back into his seat. Then they were airborne, and the airport lights were falling away below them. Shadow looked at the man in the seat next to him.
His hair was a reddish-gray; his beard, little more than stubble, was grayish-red. He was smaller than Shadow, but he seemed to take up a hell of a lot of room. A craggy, square face with pale gray eyes. The suit looked expensive, and was the color of melted vanilla ice cream. His tie was dark gray silk, and the tiepin was a tree, worked in silver: trunk, branches, and deep roots.
He held his glass of Jack Daniel's as they took off, and did not spill a drop.
""Aren't you going to ask me what kind of job?""
""How do you know who I am?""
The man chuckled. ""Oh, it's the easiest thing in the world to know what people call themselves. A little thought, a little luck, a little memory. Ask me what kind of job.""
""No,"" said Shadow. The attendant brought him another glass of beer, and he sipped at it.
""Why not?""
""I'm going home. I've got a job waiting for me there. I don't want any other job.""
The man's craggy smile did not change, outwardly, but now he seemed, actually, amused. ""You don't have a job waiting for you at home,"" he said. ""You have nothing waiting for you there. Meanwhile, I am offering you a perfectly legal job-good money, limited security, remarkable fringe benefits. Hell, if you live that long, I could throw in a pension plan. You think maybe you'd like one of them?""
Shadow said, ""You could have seen my name on my boarding pass. Or on the side of my bag.""
The man said nothing.
""Whoever you are,"" said Shadow, ""you couldn't have known I was going to be on this plane. I didn't know I was going to be on this plane, and if my plane hadn't been diverted to St. Louis, I wouldn't have been. My guess is you're a practical joker. Maybe you're hustling something. But I think maybe we'll have a better time if we end this conversation here.""
The man shrugged.
Shadow picked up the in-flight magazine. The little plane jerked and bumped through the sky, making it harder to concentrate. The words floated through his mind like soap bubbles, there as he read them, gone completely a moment later.
The man sat quietly in the seat beside him, sipping his Jack Daniel's. His eyes were closed.
Shadow read the list of in-flight music channels available on transatlantic flights, and then he was looking at the map of the world with red lines on it that showed where the airline flew. Then he had finished reading the magazine, and, reluctantly, he closed the cover, and slipped it into the pocket on the wall.
The man opened his eyes. There was something strange about his eyes, Shadow thought. One of them was a darker gray than the other. He looked at Shadow. ""By the way,"" he said, ""I was sorry to hear about your wife, Shadow. A great loss.""
Shadow nearly hit the man, then. Instead he took a deep breath. (""Like I said, don't piss off those bitches in airports,"" said Johnnie Larch, in the back of his mind, ""or they'll haul your sorry ass back here before you can spit."") He counted to five.
""So was I,"" he said.
The man shook his head. ""If it could but have been any other way,"" he said, and sighed.
""She died in a car crash,"" said Shadow. ""It's a fast way to go. Other ways could have been worse.""
The man shook his head, slowly. For a moment it seemed to Shadow as if the man was insubstantial; as if the plane had suddenly become more real, while his neighbor had become less so.
""Shadow,"" he said. ""It's not a joke. It's not a trick. I can pay you better than any other job you'll find will pay you. You're an ex-con. There's not a long line of people elbowing each other out of the way to hire you.""
""Mister whoever-the-fuck-you-are,"" said Shadow, just loud enough to be heard over the din of the engines, ""there isn't enough money in the world.""
The grin got bigger. Shadow found himself remembering a PBS show he had seen as a teenager, about chimpanzees. The show claimed that when apes and chimps smile it's only to bare their teeth in a grimace of hate or aggression or terror. When a chimp grins, it's a threat. This grin was one of those.
""Sure there's money enough. And there are also bonuses. Work for me, and I'll tell you things. There may be a little risk, of course, but if you survive you can have whatever your heart desires. You could be the next king of America. Now,"" said the man, ""who else is going to pay you that well? Hmm?""
""Who are you?"" asked Shadow.
""Ah, yes. The age of information-young lady, could you pour me another glass of Jack Daniel's? Easy on the ice-not, of course, that there has ever been any other kind of age. Information and knowledge: these are currencies that have never gone out of style.""
""I said, who are you?""
""Let's see. Well, seeing that today certainly is my day-why don't you call me Wednesday? Mister Wednesday. Although given the weather, it might as well be Thursday, eh?""
""What's your real name?""
""Work for me long enough and well enough,"" said the man in the pale suit, ""and I may even tell you that. There. Job offer. Think about it. No one expects you to say yes immediately, not knowing whether you're leaping into a piranha tank or a pit of bears. Take your time."" He closed his eyes and leaned back in his seat.
""I don't think so,"" said Shadow. ""I don't like you. I don't want to work with you.""
""Like I say,"" said the man, without opening his eyes, ""don't rush into it. Take your time.""
The plane landed with a bump, and a few passengers got off. Shadow looked out of the window: it was a little airport in the middle of nowhere, and there were still two little airports to go before Eagle Point. Shadow transferred his glance to the man in the pale suit-Mr. Wednesday? He seemed to be asleep.
Shadow stood up, grabbed his bag, and stepped off the plane, down the steps onto the slick wet tarmac, walking at an even pace toward the lights of the terminal. A light rain spattered his face.
Before he went inside the airport building, he stopped, and turned, and watched. No one else got off the plane. The ground crew rolled the steps away, the door was closed, and it taxied off down the runway. Shadow stared at it until it took off, then he walked inside, to the Budget car rental desk, the only one open, and he rented what turned out, when he got to the parking lot, to be a small red Toyota.
Shadow unfolded the map they had given him. He spread it out on the passenger's seat. Eagle Point was about two hundred and fifty miles away, most of the journey on the freeway. He had not driven a car in three years.
The storms had passed, if they had come this far. It was cold and clear. Clouds scudded in front of the moon, and for a moment Shadow could not be certain whether it was the clouds or the moon that was moving.
He drove north for an hour and a half.
It was getting late. He was hungry, and when he realized how hungry he really was, he pulled off at the next exit, and drove into the town of Nottamun (pop. 1,301). He filled the gas-tank at the Amoco, and asked the bored woman at the cash register where the best bar in the area was-somewhere that he could get something to eat.
""Jack's Crocodile Bar,"" she told him. ""It's west on County Road N.""
""Crocodile Bar?""
""Yeah. Jack says they add character."" She drew him a map on the back of a mauve flyer, which advertised a chicken roast to raise money for a young girl who needed a new kidney. ""He's got a couple of crocodiles, a snake, one a them big lizard things.""
""An iguana?""
""That's him.""
Through the town, over a bridge, on for a couple of miles, and he stopped at a low, rectangular building with an illuminated Pabst sign, and a Coca-Cola machine by the door.
The parking lot was half-empty. Shadow parked the red Toyota and went inside.
The air was thick with smoke and ""Walkin' after Midnight"" was playing on the jukebox. Shadow looked around for the crocodiles, but could not see them. He wondered if the woman in the gas station had been pulling his leg.
""What'll it be?"" asked the bartender.
""You Jack?""
""It's Jack's night off. I'm Paul.""
""Hi, Paul. House beer, and a hamburger with all the trimmings. No fries.""
""Bowl of chili to start? Best chili in the state.""
""Sounds good,"" said Shadow. ""Where's the restroom?""
The man pointed to a door in the corner of the bar. There was a stuffed alligator head mounted on the door. Shadow went through the door.
It was a clean, well-lit restroom. Shadow looked around the room first; force of habit. (""Remember, Shadow, you can't fight back when you're pissing,"" Low Key said, low-key as always, in the back of his head.) He took the urinal stall on the left. Then he unzipped his fly and pissed for an age, relaxing, feeling relief. He read the yellowing press clipping framed at eye-level, with a photo of Jack and two alligators.
There was a polite grunt from the urinal immediately to his right, although he had heard nobody come in.
The man in the pale suit was bigger standing than he had seemed sitting on the plane beside Shadow. He was almost Shadow's height, and Shadow was a big man. He was staring ahead of him. He finished pissing, shook off the last few drops, and zipped himself up.
Then he grinned, like a fox eating shit from a barbed wire fence. ""So,"" said Mr. Wednesday. ""You've had time to think, Shadow. Do you want a job?""
Somewhere in America LOS ANGELES. 11:26 P.M. 
In a dark red room-the color of the walls is close to that of raw liver-is a tall woman dressed cartoonishly in too-tight silk shorts, her breasts pulled up and pushed forward by the yellow blouse tied beneath them. Her black hair is piled high and knotted on top of her head. Standing beside her is a short man wearing an olive T-shirt and expensive blue jeans. He is holding, in his right hand, a wallet and a Nokia mobile phone with a red, white, and blue face-plate.
The red room contains a bed, upon which are white satin-style sheets and an ox-blood bedspread. At the foot of the bed is a small wooden table, upon which is a small stone statue of a woman with enormous hips, and a candleholder.
The woman hands the man a small red candle. ""Here,"" she says. ""Light it.""
""Me?""
""Yes,"" she says, ""if you want to have me.""
""I shoulda just got you to suck me off in the car.""
""Perhaps,"" she says. ""Don't you want me?"" Her hand runs up her body from thigh to breast, a gesture of presentation, as if she were demonstrating a new product.
Red silk scarves over the lamp in the corner of the room make the light red.
The man looks at her hungrily, then he takes the candle from her and pushes it into the candleholder. ""You got a light?""
She passes him a book of matches. He tears off a match, lights the wick: it flickers and then burns with a steady flame, which gives the illusion of motion to the faceless statue beside it, all hips and breasts. ""Put the money beneath the statue.""
""Fifty bucks.""
""Yes.""
""When I saw you first, on Sunset, I almost thought you were a man.""
""But I have these,"" she says, unknotting the yellow blouse, freeing her breasts.
""So do a lot of guys, these days.""
She stretches and smiles. ""Yes,"" she says. ""Now, come love me.""
He unbuttons his blue jeans, and removes his olive T-shirt. She massages his white shoulders with her brown fingers; then she turns him over, and begins to make love to him with her hands, and her fingers, and her tongue.
It seems to him that the lights in the red room have been dimmed, and the sole illumination comes from the candle, which burns with a bright flame.
""What's your name?"" he asks her.
""Bilquis,"" she tells him, raising her head. ""With a Q.""
""A what?""
""Never mind.""
He is gasping now. ""Let me fuck you,"" he says. ""I have to fuck you.""
""Okay, hon,"" she says. ""We'll do it. But will you do something for me, while you're doing it?""
""Hey,"" he says, suddenly tetchy, ""I'm paying you, you know.""
She straddles him, in one smooth movement, whispering, ""I know, honey, I know, you're paying me, and I mean, look at you, I should be paying you, I'm so lucky...""
He purses his lips, trying to show that her hooker talk is having no effect on him, he can't be taken; that she's a street whore for Chrissakes, while he's practically a producer, and he knows all about last-minute rip-offs, but she doesn't ask for money. Instead she says, ""Honey, while you're giving it to me, while you're pushing that big hard thing inside of me, will you worship me?""
""Will I what?""
She is rocking back and forth on him: the engorged head of his penis is being rubbed against the wet lips of her vulva.
""Will you call me goddess? Will you pray to me? Will you worship me with your body?""
He smiles. Is that what she wants? ""Sure,"" he says. We've all got our kinks, at the end of the day. She reaches her hand between her legs and slips him inside her.
""Is that good, is it, goddess?"" he asks, gasping.
""Worship me, honey,"" says Bilquis, the hooker.
""Yes,"" he says. ""I worship your breasts and your eyes and your cunt. I worship your thighs and your eyes and your cherry-red lips...""
""Yes...,"" she croons, riding him like a storm-tossed boat rides the waves.
""I worship your nipples, from which the milk of life flows. Your kiss is honey and your touch scorches like fire, and I worship it."" His words are becoming more rhythmic now, keeping pace with the thrust and roll of their bodies. ""Bring me your lust in the morning, and bring me relief and your blessing in the evening. Let me walk in dark places unharmed and let me come to you once more and sleep beside you and make love with you again. I worship you with everything that is within me, and everything inside my mind, with everywhere I've been and my dreams and my..."" He breaks off, panting for breath. ""...What are you doing? That feels amazing. So amazing..."" And he looks down at his hips, at the place where the two of them conjoin, but her forefinger touches his chin and pushes his head back, so he is looking only at her face and at the ceiling once again.
""Keep talking, honey,"" she says. ""Don't stop. Doesn't it feel good?""
""It feels better than anything has ever felt,"" he tells her, meaning it as he says it. ""Your eyes are stars, burning in the, shit, the firmament, and your lips are gentle waves that lick the sand, and I wworship them,"" and now he's thrusting deeper and deeper inside her: he feels electric, as if his whole lower body has become sexually charged: priapic, engorged, blissful.
""Bring me your gift,"" he mutters, no longer knowing what he is saying, ""your one true gift, and make me always this...always so...I pray...I...""
And then the pleasure crests into orgasm, blasting his mind into void, his head and self and entire beingness a perfect blank as he thrusts deeper into her and deeper still...
Eyes closed, spasming, he luxuriates in the moment; and then he feels a lurch, and it seems to him that he is hanging, head-down, although the pleasure continues.
He opens his eyes.
He thinks, grasping for thought and reason again, of birth, and wonders, without fear, in a moment of perfect postcoital clarity, whether what he sees is some kind of illusion.
This is what he sees:
He is inside her to the chest, and as he stares at this in disbelief and wonder she rests both hands upon his shoulders and puts gentle pressure on his body.
He slipslides further inside her.
""How are you doing this to me?"" he asks, or he thinks he asks, but perhaps it is only in his head.
""You're doing it, honey,"" she whispers. He feels the lips of her vulva tight around his upper chest and back, constricting and enveloping him. He wonders what this would look like to somebody watching them. He wonders why he is not scared. And then he knows.
""I worship you with my body,"" he whispers, as she pushes him inside her. Her labia pull slickly across his face, and his eyes slip into darkness.
She stretches on the bed, like a huge cat, and then she yawns. ""Yes,"" she says, ""You do.""
The Nokia phone plays a high, electrical transposition of the ""Ode to Joy."" She picks it up, and thumbs a key, and puts the telephone to her ear.
Her belly is flat, her labia small and closed. A sheen of sweat glistens on her forehead and on her upper lip.
""Yeah?"" she says. And then she says, ""No, honey, he's not here. He's gone away.""
She turns the telephone off before she flops out on the bed in the dark red room, then she stretches once more, and she closes her eyes, and she sleeps.

-OLD SONG 
I have taken the liberty,"" said Mr. Wednesday, washing his hands in the men's room of Jack's Crocodile Bar, ""of ordering food for myself, to be delivered to your table. We have much to discuss, after all.""
""I don't think so,"" said Shadow. He dried his own hands on a paper towel and crumpled it, and dropped it into the bin.
""You need a job,"" said Wednesday. ""People don't hire ex-cons. You folk make them uncomfortable.""
""I have a job waiting. A good job.""
""Would that be the job at the Muscle Farm?""
""Maybe,"" said Shadow.
""Nope. You don't. Robbie Burton's dead. Without him the Muscle Farm's dead too.""
""You're a liar.""
""Of course. And a good one. The best you will ever meet. But, I'm afraid, I'm not lying to you about this."" He reached into his pocket, produced a newspaper, much folded, and handed it to Shadow. ""Page seven,"" he said. ""Come on back to the bar. You can read it at the table."" Shadow pushed open the door, back into the bar. The air was blue with smoke, and the Dixie Cups were on the jukebox singing ""Iko Iko."" Shadow smiled, slightly, in recognition of the old children's song.
The barman pointed to a table in the corner. There was a bowl of chili and a burger at one side of the table, a rare steak and a bowl of fries laid in the place across from it.

Look at my King all dressed in Red,
Iko Iko all day,
I bet you five dollars he'll kill you dead,
Jockamo-feena-nay
 
Shadow took his seat at the table. He put the newspaper down. ""I got out of prison this morning,"" he said. ""This is my first meal as a free man. You won't object if I wait until after I've eaten to read your page seven?""
""Not in the slightest bit.""
Shadow ate his hamburger. It was better than prison hamburgers. The chili was good but, he decided, after a couple of mouthfuls, not the best in the state.
Laura made a great chili. She used lean-cut meat, dark kidney beans, carrots cut small, a bottle or so of dark beer, and freshly sliced hot peppers. She would let the chili cook for a while, then add red wine, lemon juice, and a pinch of fresh dill, and, finally, measure out and add her chili powders. On more than one occasion Shadow had tried to get her to show him how she made it: he would watch everything she did, from slicing the onions and dropping them into the olive oil at the bottom of the pot on. He had even written down the sequence of events, ingredient by ingredient, and he had once made Laura's chili for himself on a weekend when she had been out of town. It had tasted okay-it was certainly edible, and he ate it, but it had not been Laura's chili.
The news item on page seven was the first account of his wife's death that Shadow had read. It felt strange, as if he were reading about someone in a story: how Laura Moon, whose age was given in the article as twenty-seven, and Robbie Burton, thirty-nine, were in Robbie's car on the interstate, when they swerved into the path of a thirty-two wheeler, which sideswiped them as it tried to change lanes and avoid them. The truck brushed Robbie's car and sent it spinning off the side of the road, where the car had hit a road sign, hard, and stopped spinning.
Rescue crews were on the scene in minutes. They pulled Robbie and Laura from the wreckage. They were both dead by the time they arrived at the hospital.
Shadow folded the newspaper up once more, and slid it back across the table, toward Wednesday, who was gorging himself on a steak so bloody and so blue it might never have been introduced to a kitchen flame.
""Here. Take it back,"" said Shadow.
Robbie had been driving. He must have been drunk, although the newspaper account said nothing about this. Shadow found himself imagining Laura's face when she realized that Robbie was too drunk to drive. The scenario unfolded in Shadow's mind, and there was nothing he could do to stop it: Laura shouting at Robbie-shouting at him to pull off the road, then the thud of car against truck, and the steering wheel wrenching over...
...the car on the side of the road, broken glass glittering like ice and diamonds in the headlights, blood pooling in rubies on the road beside them. Two bodies, dead or soon-to-die, being carried from the wreck, or laid neatly by the side of the road.
""Well?"" asked Mr. Wednesday. He had finished his steak, sliced and devoured it like a starving man. Now he was munching the french fries, spearing them with his fork.
""You're right,"" said Shadow. ""I don't have a job.""
Shadow took a quarter from his pocket, tails up. He flicked it up in the air, knocking it against his finger as it left his hand to give it a wobble that made it look as if it were turning, caught it, slapped it down on the back of his hand.
""Call,"" he said.
""Why?"" asked Wednesday.
""I don't want to work for anyone with worse luck than me. Call.""
""Heads,"" said Mr. Wednesday.
""Sorry,"" said Shadow, revealing the coin without even bothering to glance at it. ""It was tails. I rigged the toss.""
""Rigged games are the easiest ones to beat,"" said Wednesday, wagging a square finger at Shadow. ""Take another look at the quarter.""
Shadow glanced down at it. The head was face-up.
""I must have fumbled the toss,"" he said, puzzled.
""You do yourself a disservice,"" said Wednesday, and he grinned. ""I'm just a lucky, lucky guy."" Then he looked up. ""Well I never. Mad Sweeney. Will you have a drink with us?""
""Southern Comfort and Coke, straight up,"" said a voice from behind Shadow.
""I'll go and talk to the barman,"" said Wednesday. He stood up, and began to make his way toward the bar.
""Aren't you going to ask what I'm drinking?"" called Shadow.
""I already know what you're drinking,"" said Wednesday, and then he was standing by the bar. Patsy Cline started to sing ""Walkin' after Midnight"" on the jukebox again.
The man who had ordered Southern Comfort and Coke sat down beside Shadow. He had a short ginger-colored beard. He wore a denim jacket covered with bright sew-on patches, and under the jacket a stained white T-shirt. On the T-shirt was printed:
IF YOU CAN'T EAT IT, DRINK IT, SMOKE IT OR SNORT IT...THEN F*CK IT! 
He wore a baseball cap, on which was printed:
THE ONLY WOMAN I HAVE EVER LOVED WAS ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE...MY MOTHER! 
He opened a soft pack of Lucky Strikes with a dirty thumbnail, took a cigarette, offered one to Shadow. Shadow was about to take one, automatically-he did not smoke, but a cigarette makes good barter material-when he realized that he was no longer inside. You could buy cigarettes here whenever you wanted. He shook his head.
""You working for our man then?"" asked the bearded man. He was not sober, although he was not yet drunk.
""It looks that way,"" said Shadow.
The bearded man lit his cigarette. ""I'm a leprechaun,"" he said.
Shadow did not smile. ""Really?"" he said. ""Shouldn't you be drinking Guinness?""
""Stereotypes. You have to learn to think outside the box,"" said the bearded man. ""There's a lot more to Ireland than Guinness.""
""You don't have an Irish accent.""
""I've been over here too fucken long.""
""So you are originally from Ireland?""
""I told you. I'm a leprechaun. We don't come from fucken Moscow.""
""I guess not.""
Wednesday returned to the table, three drinks held easily in his paw-like hands. ""Southern Comfort and Coke for you, Mad Sweeney, m'man, and a Jack Daniel's for me. And this is for you, Shadow.""
""What is it?""
""Taste it.""
The drink was a tawny golden color. Shadow took a sip, tasting an odd blend of sour and sweet on his tongue. He could taste the alcohol underneath, and a strange blend of flavors. It reminded him a little of prison hooch, brewed in a garbage bag from rotten fruit and bread and sugar and water, but it was smoother, sweeter, infinitely stranger.
""Okay,"" said Shadow. ""I tasted it. What was it?""
""Mead,"" said Wednesday. ""Honey wine. The drink of heroes. The drink of the gods.""
Shadow took another tentative sip. Yes, he could taste the honey, he decided. That was one of the tastes. ""Tastes kinda like pickle juice,"" he said. ""Sweet pickle juice wine.""
""Tastes like a drunken diabetic's piss,"" agreed Wednesday. ""I hate the stuff.""
""Then why did you bring it for me?"" asked Shadow, reasonably.
Wednesday stared at Shadow with his mismatched eyes. One of them, Shadow decided, was a glass eye, but he could not decide which one. ""I brought you mead to drink because it's traditional. And right now we need all the tradition we can get. It seals our bargain.""
""We haven't made a bargain.""
""Sure we have. You work for me. You protect me. You help me. You transport me from place to place. You investigate, from time to time-go places and ask questions for me. You run errands. In an emergency, but only in an emergency, you hurt people who need to be hurt. In the unlikely event of my death, you will hold my vigil. And in return I shall make sure that your needs are adequately taken care of.""
""He's hustling you,"" said Mad Sweeney, rubbing his bristly ginger beard. ""He's a hustler.""
""Damn straight I'm a hustler,"" said Wednesday. ""That's why I need someone to look out for my best interests.""
The song on the jukebox ended, and for a moment the bar fell quiet, every conversation at a lull.
""Someone once told me that you only get those everybody-shuts-up-at-once moments at twenty past or twenty to the hour,"" said Shadow.
Sweeney pointed to the clock above the bar, held in the massive and indifferent jaws of a stuffed alligator head. The time was 11:20.
""There,"" said Shadow. ""Damned if I know why that happens.""
""I know why,"" said Wednesday.
""You going to share with the group?""
""I may tell you, one day, yes. Or I may not. Drink your mead.""
Shadow knocked the rest of the mead back in one long gulp. ""It might be better over ice,"" he said.
""Or it might not,"" said Wednesday. ""It's terrible stuff.""
""That it is,"" agreed Mad Sweeney. ""You'll excuse me for a moment, gentlemen, but I find myself in deep and urgent need of a lengthy piss."" He stood up and walked away, an impossibly tall man. He had to be almost seven feet tall, decided Shadow.
A waitress wiped a cloth across the table and took their empty plates. She emptied Sweeney's ashtray, and asked if they would like to order any more drinks. Wednesday told her to bring the same again for everyone, although this time Shadow's mead was to be on the rocks. ""Anyway,"" said Wednesday, ""that's what I need of you, if you're working for me. Which, of course, you are.""
""That's what you want,"" said Shadow. ""Would you like to know what I want?""
""Nothing could make me happier.""
The waitress brought the drink. Shadow sipped his mead on the rocks. The ice did not help-if anything it sharpened the sourness, and made the taste linger in the mouth after the mead was swallowed. However, Shadow consoled himself, it did not taste particularly alcoholic. He was not ready to be drunk. Not yet.
He took a deep breath.
""Okay,"" said Shadow. ""My life, which for three years has been a long way from being the greatest life there has ever been, just took a distinct and sudden turn for the worse. Now there are a few things I need to do. I want to go to Laura's funeral. I want to say goodbye. After that, if you still need me, I want to start at five hundred dollars a week."" The figure was a stab in the dark, a made-up number. Wednesday's eyes revealed nothing. ""If we're happy working together, in six months' time you raise it to a thousand a week.""
He paused. It was the longest speech he'd made in years. ""You say you may need people to be hurt. Well, I'll hurt people if they're trying to hurt you. But I don't hurt people for fun or for profit. I won't go back to prison. Once was enough.""
""You won't have to,"" said Wednesday.
""No,"" said Shadow. ""I won't."" He finished the last of the mead. He wondered, suddenly, somewhere in the back of his head, whether the mead was responsible for loosening his tongue. But the words were coming out of him like the water spraying from a broken fire hydrant in summer, and he could not have stopped them if he had tried. ""I don't like you, Mister Wednesday, or whatever your real name may be. We are not friends. I don't know how you got off that plane without me seeing you, or how you trailed me here. But I'm impressed. You have class. And I'm at a loose end right now. You should know that when we're done, I'll be gone. And if you piss me off, I'll be gone too. Until then, I'll work for you.""
Wednesday grinned. His smiles were strange things, Shadow decided. They contained no shred of humor, no happiness, no mirth. Wednesday looked like he had learned to smile from a manual.
""Very good,"" he said. ""Then we have a compact. And we are agreed.""
""What the hell,"" said Shadow. Across the room, Mad Sweeney was feeding quarters into the jukebox. Wednesday spat in his hand and extended it. Shadow shrugged. He spat in his own palm. They clasped hands. Wednesday began to squeeze. Shadow squeezed back. After a few seconds his hand began to hurt. Wednesday held the grip for another half-minute, and then he let go.
""Good,"" he said. ""Good. Very good."" He smiled, a brief flash, and Shadow wondered if there had been real humor in that smile, actual pleasure. ""So, one last glass of evil, vile fucking mead to seal our deal, and then we are done.""
""It'll be a Southern Comfort and Coke for me,"" said Sweeney, lurching back from the jukebox.
The jukebox began to play the Velvet Underground's ""Who Loves the Sun?"" Shadow thought it a strange song to find on a jukebox. It seemed very unlikely. But then, this whole evening had become increasingly unlikely.
Shadow took the quarter he had used for the coin-toss from the table, enjoying the sensation of a freshly milled coin against his fingers, producing it in his right hand between forefinger and thumb. He appeared to take it into his left hand in one smooth movement, while casually finger-palming it. He closed his left hand on the imaginary quarter. Then he took a second quarter in his right hand, between finger and thumb, and, as he pretended to drop that coin into the left hand, he let the palmed quarter fall into his right hand, striking the quarter he held there on the way. The chink confirmed the illusion that both coins were in his left hand, while they were now both held safely in his right.
""Coin tricks is it?"" asked Sweeney, his chin raising, his scruffy beard bristling. ""Why, if it's coin tricks we're doing, watch this.""
He took a glass from the table, a glass that had once held mead, and he tipped the ice-cubes into the ashtray. Then he reached out and took a large coin, golden and shining, from the air. He dropped it into the glass. He took another gold coin from the air and tossed it into the glass, where it clinked against the first. He took a coin from the candle flame of a candle on the wall, another from his beard, a third from Shadow's empty left hand, and dropped them, one by one, into the glass. Then he curled his fingers over the glass, and blew hard, and several more golden coins dropped into the glass from his hand. He tipped the glass of sticky coins into his jacket pocket, and then tapped the pocket to show, unmistakably, that it was empty.
""There,"" he said. ""That's a coin trick for you.""
Shadow, who had been watching closely throughout the impromptu performance, put his head on one side. ""We have to talk about that,"" he said. ""I need to know how you did it.""
""I did it,"" said Sweeney, with the air of one confiding a huge secret, ""with panache and style. That's how I did it."" He laughed, silently, rocking on his heels, his gappy teeth bared.
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""That is how you did it. You've got to teach me. All the ways of doing the Miser's Dream that I've read about you'd be hiding the coins in the hand that holds the glass, and dropping them in while you produce and vanish the coin in your right hand.""
""Sounds like a hell of a lot of work to me,"" said Mad Sweeney. ""It's easier just to pick them out of the air."" He picked up his half-finished Southern Comfort and Coke, looked at it, and put it down on the table.
Wednesday stared at both of them as if he had just discovered new and previously unimagined life forms. Then he said, ""Mead for you, Shadow. I'll stick with Mister Jack Daniel's, and for the freeloading Irishman...?""
""A bottled beer, something dark for preference,"" said Sweeney. ""Freeloader, is it?"" He picked up what was left of his drink, and raised it to Wednesday in a toast. ""May the storm pass over us, and leave us hale and unharmed,"" he said, and knocked the drink back.
""A fine toast,"" said Wednesday. ""But it won't.""
Another mead was placed in front of Shadow.
""Do I have to drink this?"" he asked, without enthusiasm.
""Yes, I'm afraid you do. It seals our deal. Third time's the charm, eh?""
""Shit,"" said Shadow. He swallowed the mead in two large gulps. The pickled honey taste filled his mouth.
""There,"" said Mr. Wednesday. ""You're my man, now.""
""So,"" said Sweeney, ""you want to know the trick of how it's done?""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""Were you loading them in your sleeve?""
""They were never in my sleeve,"" said Sweeney. He chortled to himself, rocking and bouncing as if he were a lanky, bearded, drunken volcano preparing to erupt with delight at his own brilliance. ""It's the simplest trick in the world. I'll fight you for it.""
Shadow shook his head. ""I'll pass.""
""Now there's a fine thing,"" said Sweeney to the room. ""Old Wednesday gets himself a bodyguard, and the feller's too scared to put up his fists, even.""
""I won't fight you,"" agreed Shadow.
Sweeney swayed and sweated. He fiddled with the peak of his baseball cap. Then he pulled one of his coins out of the air and placed it on the table. ""Real gold, if you were wondering,"" said Sweeney. ""Win or lose-and you'll lose-it's yours if you fight me. A big fellow like you-who'd'a thought you'd be a fucken coward?""
""He's already said he won't fight you,"" said Wednesday. ""Go away, Mad Sweeney. Take your beer and leave us in peace.""
Sweeney took a step closer to Wednesday. ""Call me a freeloader, will you, you doomed old creature? You cold-blooded, heartless old tree-hanger."" His face was turning a deep, angry red.
Wednesday put out his hands, palms up, pacific. ""Foolishness, Sweeney. Watch where you put your words.""
Sweeney glared at him. Then he said, with the gravity of the very drunk, ""You've hired a coward. What would he do if I hurt you, do you think?""
Wednesday turned to Shadow. ""I've had enough of this,"" he said. ""Deal with it.""
Shadow got to his feet and looked up into Mad Sweeney's face: how tall was the man? he wondered. ""You're bothering us,"" he said. ""You're drunk. I think you ought to leave now.""
A slow smile spread over Sweeney's face. ""There, now,"" he said. ""Like a little yapping dog, it's finally ready to fight. Hey, everybody,"" he called to the room, ""there's going to be a lesson learned. Watch this!"" He swung a huge fist at Shadow's face. Shadow jerked back: Sweeney's hand caught him beneath the right eye. He saw blotches of light, and felt pain.
And with that, the fight began.
Sweeney fought without style, without science, with nothing but enthusiasm for the fight itself: huge, barreling roundhouse blows that missed as often as they connected.
Shadow fought defensively, carefully, blocking Sweeney's blows or avoiding them. He became very aware of the audience around them. Tables were pulled out of the way with protesting groans, making a space for the men to spar. Shadow was aware at all times of Wednesday's eyes upon him, of Wednesday's humorless grin. It was a test, that was obvious, but what kind of a test? In prison Shadow had learned there were two kinds of fights: don't fuck with me fights, where you made it as showy and impressive as you could, and private fights, real fights which were fast and hard and nasty, and always over in seconds.
""Hey, Sweeney,"" said Shadow, breathless, ""why are we fighting?""
""For the joy of it,"" said Sweeney, sober now, or at least, no longer visibly drunk. ""For the sheer unholy fucken delight of it. Can't you feel the joy in your own veins, rising like the sap in the springtime?"" His lip was bleeding. So was Shadow's knuckle.
""So how'd you do the coin production?"" asked Shadow. He swayed back and twisted, took a blow on his shoulder intended for his face.
""To tell the truth,"" grunted Sweeney, ""I told you how I did it when first we spoke. But there's none so blind-ow! Good one!-as those who will not listen.""
Shadow jabbed at Sweeney, forcing him back into a table; empty glasses and ashtrays crashed to the floor. Shadow could have finished him off then. The man was defenseless, in no position to be able to do anything, sprawled back as he was.
Shadow glanced at Wednesday, who nodded. Shadow looked down at Mad Sweeney. ""Are we done?"" he asked. Mad Sweeney hesitated, then nodded. Shadow let go of him, and took several steps backward. Sweeney, panting, pushed himself back up to a standing position.
""Not on yer ass!"" he shouted. ""It ain't over till I say it is!"" Then he grinned, and threw himself forward, swinging at Shadow. He stepped onto a fallen ice-cube, and his grin turned to open-mouthed dismay as his feet went out from under him, and he fell backward. The back of his head hit the barroom floor with a definite thud.
Shadow put his knee into Mad Sweeney's chest. ""For the second time, are we done fighting?"" he asked.
""We may as well be, at that,"" said Sweeney, raising his head from the floor, ""for the joy's gone out of me now, like the pee from a small boy in a swimming pool on a hot day."" And he spat the blood from his mouth and closed his eyes and began to snore, in deep and magnificent snores.
Somebody clapped Shadow on the back. Wednesday put a bottle of beer into his hand.
It tasted better than mead.
  
Shadow woke up stretched out in the back of a sedan car. The morning sun was dazzling, and his head hurt. He sat up awkwardly, rubbing his eyes.
Wednesday was driving. He was humming tunelessly as he drove. He had a paper cup of coffee in the cup holder. They were heading along what looked like an interstate highway, with the cruise control set to an even sixty-five. The passenger seat was empty.
""How are you feeling, this fine morning?"" asked Wednesday, without turning around.
""What happened to my car?"" asked Shadow. ""It was a rental.""
""Mad Sweeney took it back for you. It was part of the deal the two of you cut last night.""
""Deal?""
""After the fight.""
""Fight?"" He put one hand up and rubbed his cheek, and then he winced. Yes, there had been a fight. He remembered a tall man with a ginger beard, and the cheering and whooping of an appreciative audience. ""Who won?""
""You don't remember, eh?"" Wednesday chuckled.
""Not so you'd notice,"" said Shadow. Conversations from the night before began to jostle in his head uncomfortably. ""You got any more of that coffee?""
The big man reached beneath the passenger seat and passed back an unopened bottle of water. ""Here. You'll be dehydrated. This will help more than coffee, for the moment. We'll stop at the next gas station and get you some breakfast. You'll need to clean yourself up, too. You look like something the goat dragged in.""
""Cat dragged in,"" said Shadow.
""Goat,"" said Wednesday. ""Huge rank stinking goat with big teeth.""
Shadow unscrewed the top of the water and drank. Something clinked heavily in his jacket pocket. He put his hand into the pocket and pulled out a coin the size of a half-dollar. It was heavy, and a deep yellow in color. It was also slightly sticky. Shadow palmed it in his right hand, classic palm, then produced it from between his third and fourth fingers. He front-palmed it, holding it between his first and his little finger, so it was invisible from behind, then slipped his two middle fingers under it, pivoting it smoothly into a back-palm. Finally he dropped the coin back into his left hand, and he placed it into his pocket.
""What the hell was I drinking last night?"" asked Shadow. The events of the night were crowding around him now, without shape, without sense, but he knew they were there.
Mr. Wednesday spotted an exit sign promising a gas station, and he gunned the engine. ""You don't remember?""
""No.""
""You were drinking mead,"" said Wednesday. He grinned a huge grin.
Mead.
Yes.
Shadow leaned back in the seat, and sucked down water from the bottle, and let the night before wash over him. Most of it, he remembered. Some of it, he didn't.
  
In the gas station Shadow bought a Clean-U-Up Kit, which contained a razor, a packet of shaving cream, a comb, and a disposable toothbrush packed with a tiny tube of toothpaste. Then he walked into the men's restroom and looked at himself in the mirror.
He had a bruise under one eye-when he prodded it, experimentally, with one finger, he found it hurt deeply-and a swollen lower lip. His hair was a tangle, and he looked as if he had spent the first half of last night fighting and then the rest of the night fast asleep, fully dressed, in the back seat of a car. Tinny music played in the background: it took him some moments to identify it as the Beatles' ""Fool on the Hill.""
Shadow washed his face with the restroom's liquid soap, then he lathered his face and shaved. He wet his hair and combed it back. He brushed his teeth. Then he washed the last traces of the soap and the toothpaste from his face with lukewarm water. Stared back at his reflection: clean-shaven, but his eyes were still red and puffy. He looked older than he remembered.
He wondered what Laura would say when she saw him, and then he remembered that Laura wouldn't say anything ever again and he saw his face, in the mirror, tremble, but only for a moment.
He went out.
""I look like shit,"" said Shadow.
""Of course you do,"" agreed Wednesday.
Wednesday took an assortment of snack-food up to the cash register, and paid for that and their gas, changing his mind twice about whether he was doing it with plastic or with cash, to the irritation of the gum-chewing young lady behind the till. Shadow watched as Wednesday became increasingly flustered and apologetic. He seemed very old, suddenly. The girl gave him his cash back, and put the purchase on the card, and then gave him the card receipt and took his cash, then returned the cash and took a different card. Wednesday was obviously on the verge of tears, an old man made helpless by the implacable plastic march of the modern world.
Shadow checked out the payphone: an out-of-order sign hung on it.
They walked out of the warm gas station, and their breath steamed in the air.
""You want me to drive?"" asked Shadow.
""Hell no,"" said Wednesday.
The freeway slipped past them: browning grass meadows on each side of them. The trees were leafless and dead. Two black birds stared at them from a telegraph wire.
""Hey, Wednesday.""
""What?""
""The way I saw it in there, you never paid for the gas.""
""Oh?""
""The way I saw it, she wound up paying you for the privilege of having you in her gas station. You think she's figured it out yet?""
""She never will.""
""So what are you? A two-bit con artist?""
Wednesday nodded. ""Yes,"" he said. ""I suppose I am. Among other things.""
He swung out into the left lane to pass a truck. The sky was a bleak and uniform gray.
""It's going to snow,"" said Shadow.
""Yes.""
""Sweeney. Did he actually show me how he did that trick with the gold coins?""
""Oh yes.""
""I can't remember.""
""It'll come back. It was a long night.""
Several small snowflakes brushed the windshield, melting in seconds.
""Your wife's body is on display at Wendell's Funeral Parlor at present,"" said Wednesday. ""Then after lunch they will take her from there to the graveyard for the interment.""
""How do you know?""
""I called ahead while you were in the john. You know where Wendell's Funeral Parlor is?""
Shadow nodded. The snowflakes whirled and dizzied in front of them.
""This is our exit,"" said Shadow. The car stole off the interstate, and past the cluster of motels to the north of Eagle Point.
Three years had passed. Yes. The Super-8 motel had gone, torn down: in its place was a Wendy's. There were more stoplights, unfamiliar storefronts. They drove downtown. Shadow asked Wednesday to slow as they drove past the Muscle Farm. CLOSED INDEFINITELY, said the hand-lettered sign on the door, DUE TO BEREAVEMENT.
Left on Main Street. Past a new tattoo parlor and the Armed Forces Recruitment Center, then the Burger King, and, familiar and unchanged, Olsen's Drug Store, and at last the yellow-brick facade of Wendell's Funeral Parlor. A neon sign in the front window said HOUSE OF REST. Blank tombstones stood unchristened and uncarved in the window beneath the sign.
Wednesday pulled up in the parking lot.
""Do you want me to come in?"" he asked.
""Not particularly.""
""Good."" The grin flashed, without humor. ""There's business I can be getting on with while you say your goodbyes. I'll get rooms for us at the Motel America. Meet me there when you're done.""
Shadow got out of the car, and watched it pull away. Then he walked in. The dimly lit corridor smelled of flowers and of furniture polish, with just the slightest tang of formaldehyde and rot beneath the surface. At the far end was the Chapel of Rest.
Shadow realized that he was palming the gold coin, moving it compulsively from a back palm to a front palm to a Downs palm, over and over. The weight was reassuring in his hand.
His wife's name was on a sheet of paper beside the door at the far end of the corridor. He walked into the Chapel of Rest. Shadow knew most of the people in the room: Laura's family, her workmates at the travel agency, several of her friends.
They all recognized him. He could see it in their faces. There were no smiles, though, no hellos.
At the end of the room was a small dais, and, on it, a cream-colored casket with several displays of flowers arranged about it: scarlets and yellows and whites and deep, bloody purples. He took a step forward. He could see Laura's body from where he was standing. He did not want to walk forward; he did not dare to walk away.
A man in a dark suit-Shadow guessed he worked at the funeral home-said, ""Sir? Would you like to sign the condolence and remembrance book?"" and pointed him to a leather-bound book, open on a small lectern.
He wrote SHADOW and the date in his precise handwriting, then, slowly, he wrote (PUPPY) beside it, putting off walking toward the end of the room, where the people were, and the casket, and the thing in the cream casket that was no longer Laura.
A small woman walked in from the corridor, and hesitated. Her hair was a coppery red, and her clothes were expensive and very black. Widow's weeds, thought Shadow, who knew her well: Audrey Burton, Robbie's wife.
Audrey was holding a sprig of violets, wrapped at the base with silver foil. It was the kind of thing a child would make in June, thought Shadow. But violets were out of season.
Audrey looked directly at Shadow, and there was no recognition in her eyes. Then she walked across the room, to Laura's casket. Shadow followed her.
Laura lay with her eyes closed, and her arms folded across her chest. She wore a conservative blue suit he did not recognize. Her long brown hair was out of her eyes. It was his Laura and it was not: her repose, he realized, was what was unnatural. Laura was always such a restless sleeper.
Audrey placed her sprig of summer violets on Laura's chest. Then she pursed her blackberry-colored lips, worked her mouth for a moment and spat, hard, onto Laura's dead face.
The spit caught Laura on the cheek, and began to drip down toward her ear.
Audrey was already walking toward the door. Shadow hurried after her. ""Audrey?"" he said. This time she recognized him. He wondered if she was taking tranquilizers. Her voice was distant and detached.
""Shadow? Did you escape? Or did they let you out?""
""Let me out yesterday. I'm a free man,"" said Shadow. ""What the hell was that all about?""
She stopped in the dark corridor. ""The violets? They were always her favorite flower. When we were girls we used to pick them together.""
""Not the violets.""
""Oh, that,"" she said. She wiped a speck of something invisible from the corner of her mouth. ""Well, I would have thought that was obvious.""
""Not to me, Audrey.""
""They didn't tell you?"" Her voice was calm, emotionless. ""Your wife died with my husband's cock in her mouth, Shadow.""
She turned away, walked out into the parking lot, and Shadow watched her leave.
He went back into the funeral home. Someone had already wiped away the spit.
  
None of the people at the viewing were able to meet Shadow's eye. Those who came over and talked to him did so as little as they could, mumbled awkward commiserations and fled.
After lunch-Shadow ate at the Burger King-was the burial. Laura's cream-colored coffin was interred in the small non-denominational cemetery on the edge of town: unfenced, a hilly woodland meadow filled with black granite and white marble headstones.
He rode to the cemetery in the Wendell's hearse, with Laura's mother. Mrs. McCabe seemed to feel that Laura's death was Shadow's fault. ""If you'd been here,"" she said, ""this would never have happened. I don't know why she married you. I told her. Time and again, I told her. But they don't listen to their mothers, do they?"" She stopped, looked more closely at Shadow's face. ""Have you been fighting?""
""Yes,"" he said.
""Barbarian,"" she said, then she set her mouth, raised her head so her chins quivered, and stared straight ahead of her.
To Shadow's surprise Audrey Burton was also at the funeral, standing toward the back. The short service ended, the casket was lowered into the cold ground. The people went away.
Shadow did not leave. He stood there with his hands in his pockets, shivering, staring at the hole in the ground.
Above him the sky was iron gray, featureless and flat as a mirror. It continued to snow, erratically, in ghost-like tumbling flakes.
There was something he wanted to say to Laura, and he was prepared to wait until he knew what it was. The world slowly began to lose light and color. Shadow's feet were going numb, while his hands and face hurt from the cold. He burrowed his hands into his pockets for warmth, and his fingers closed about the gold coin.
He walked over to the grave.
""This is for you,"" he said.
Several shovels of earth had been emptied onto the casket, but the hole was far from full. He threw the gold coin into the grave with Laura, then he pushed more earth into the hole, to hide the coin from acquisitive gravediggers. He brushed the earth from his hands, and said, ""Good night, Laura."" Then he said, ""I'm sorry."" He turned his face toward the lights of the town, and began to walk back into Eagle Point.
His motel was a good two miles away, but after spending three years in prison he was relishing the idea that he could simply walk and walk, forever if need be. He could keep walking north, and wind up in Alaska, or head south, to Mexico and beyond. He could walk to Patagonia, or to Tierra del Fuego. The Land of Fire. He tried to remember how it had got its name: he remembered reading as a boy of naked men, crouched by fires to keep warm...
A car drew up beside him. The window hummed down.
""You want a lift, Shadow?"" asked Audrey Burton.
""No,"" he said. ""Not from you.""
He continued to walk. Audrey drove beside him at three miles an hour. Snowflakes danced in the beams of her headlights.
""I thought she was my best friend,"" said Audrey. ""We'd talk every day. When Robbie and I had a fight, she'd be the first one to know-we'd go down to Chi-Chi's for margaritas and to talk about what scumpots men can be. And all the time she was fucking him behind my back.""
""Please go away, Audrey.""
""I just want you to know I had good reason for what I did.""
He said nothing.
""Hey!"" she shouted. ""Hey! I'm talking to you!""
Shadow turned. ""Do you want me to tell you that you were right when you spit in Laura's face? Do you want me to say it didn't hurt? Or that what you told me made me hate her more than I miss her? It's not going to happen, Audrey.""
She drove beside him for another minute, not saying anything. Then she said, ""So, how was prison, Shadow?""
""It was fine,"" said Shadow. ""You would have felt right at home.""
She put her foot down on the gas then, making the engine roar, and drove on and away.
With the headlights gone, the world was dark. Twilight faded into night. Shadow kept expecting the act of walking to warm him, to spread warmth through his icy hands and feet. It didn't happen.
Back in prison, Low Key Lyesmith had once referred to the little prison cemetery out behind the infirmary as the Bone Orchard, and the image had taken root in Shadow's mind. That night he had dreamed of an orchard under the moonlight, of skeletal white trees, their branches ending in bony hands, their roots going deep down into the graves. There was fruit that grew upon the trees in the bone orchard, in his dream, and there was something very disturbing about the fruit in the dream, but on waking he could no longer remember what strange fruit grew on the trees, or why he found it so repellent.
Cars passed him. Shadow wished that there was a sidewalk. He tripped on something that he could not see in the dark and sprawled into the ditch on the side of the road, his right hand sinking into several inches of cold mud. He climbed to his feet and wiped his hands on the leg of his pants. He stood there, awkwardly. He had only enough time to observe that there was someone beside him before something wet was forced over his nose and mouth, and he tasted harsh, chemical fumes.
This time the ditch seemed warm and comforting.
  
Shadow's temples felt as if they had been reattached to the rest of his skull with roofing nails, and his vision was blurred.
His hands were bound behind his back with what felt like some kind of straps. He was in a car, sitting on leather upholstery. For a moment he wondered if there was something wrong with his depth perception and then he understood that, no, the other seat really was that far away.
There were people sitting beside him, but he could not turn to look at them.
The fat young man at the other end of the stretch limo took a can of Diet Coke from the cocktail bar and popped it open. He wore a long black coat, made of some silky material, and he appeared barely out of his teens: a spattering of acne glistened on one cheek. He smiled when he saw that Shadow was awake.
""Hello, Shadow,"" he said. ""Don't fuck with me.""
""Okay,"" said Shadow. ""I won't. Can you drop me off at the Motel America, up by the interstate?""
""Hit him,"" said the young man to the person on Shadow's left. A punch was delivered to Shadow's solar plexus, knocking the breath from him, doubling him over. He straightened up, slowly.
""I said don't fuck with me. That was fucking with me. Keep your answers short and to the point or I'll fucking kill you. Or maybe I won't kill you. Maybe I'll have the children break every bone in your fucking body. There are two hundred and six of them. So don't fuck with me.""
""Got it,"" said Shadow.
The ceiling lights in the limo changed color from violet to blue then to green and to yellow.
""You're working for Wednesday,"" said the young man.
""Yes,"" said Shadow.
""What the fuck is he after? I mean, what's he doing here? He must have a plan. What's the game plan?""
""I started working for Mr. Wednesday this morning,"" said Shadow. ""I'm an errand boy. Maybe a driver, if he ever lets me drive. We've barely exchanged a dozen words.""
""You're saying you don't know?""
""I'm saying I don't know.""
The boy stared at him. He swigged some Coke from the can, belched, stared some more. ""Would you tell me if you did know?""
""Probably not,"" admitted Shadow. ""As you say, I'm working for Mr. Wednesday.""
The boy opened his jacket and took out a silver cigarette case from an inside pocket. He opened it, and offered a cigarette to Shadow. ""Smoke?""
Shadow thought about asking for his hands to be untied, but decided against it. ""No thank you,"" he said.
The cigarette appeared to have been hand-rolled, and when the boy lit it, with a matte black Zippo lighter, the odor that filled the limo was not tobacco. It was not pot either, decided Shadow. It smelled a little like burning electrical parts.
The boy inhaled deeply, then held his breath. He let the smoke trickle out from his mouth, pulled it back into his nostrils. Shadow suspected that he had practiced that in front of a mirror for a while before doing it in public.
""If you've lied to me,"" said the boy, as if from a long way away, ""I'll fucking kill you. You know that.""
""So you said.""
The boy took another long drag on his cigarette. The lights inside the limo transmuted from orange, to red, and back to purple. ""You say you're staying at the Motel America?"" He tapped on the driver's window, behind him. The glass window lowered. ""Hey. Motel America, up by the interstate. We need to drop off our guest.""
The driver nodded, and the glass rose up again.
The glinting fiber-optic lights inside the limo continued to change, cycling through their set of dim colors. It seemed to Shadow that the boy's eyes were glinting too, the green of an antique computer monitor.
""You tell Wednesday this, man. You tell him he's history. He's forgotten. He's old. And he better accept it. Tell him that we are the future and we don't give a fuck about him or anyone like him. His time is over. Yes? You fucking tell him that, man. He has been consigned to the Dumpster of history while people like me ride our limos down the superhighway of tomorrow.""
""I'll tell him,"" said Shadow. He was beginning to feel light-headed. He hoped that he was not going to be sick.
""Tell him that we have fucking reprogrammed reality. Tell him that language is a virus and that religion is an operating system and that prayers are just so much fucking spam. Tell him that or I'll fucking kill you,"" said the young man mildly, from the smoke.
""Got it,"" said Shadow. ""You can let me out here. I can walk the rest of the way.""
The young man nodded. ""Good talking to you,"" he said. The smoke had mellowed him. ""You should know that if we do fucking kill you then we'll just delete you. You got that? One click and you're overwritten with random ones and zeros. Undelete is not an option."" He tapped on the window behind him. ""He's getting off here,"" he said. Then he turned back to Shadow, pointed to his cigarette. ""Synthetic toad-skins,"" he said. ""You know they can synthesize bufotenin now?""
The car stopped. The person to Shadow's right got out and held the door open for Shadow. Shadow climbed out awkwardly, his hands tied behind his back. He realized that he had not yet got a clear look at either of the people who had been in the back seat with him. He did not know if they were men or women, old or young.
Shadow's bonds were cut. The nylon strips fell to the tarmac. Shadow turned around. The inside of the car was now one writhing cloud of smoke in which two lights glinted, copper-colored, like the beautiful eyes of a toad. ""It's all about the dominant fucking paradigm, Shadow. Nothing else is important. And hey, sorry to hear about your old lady.""
The door closed, and the stretch limo drove off, quietly. Shadow was a couple of hundred yards away from his motel, and he walked there, breathing the cold air, past red and yellow and blue lights advertising every kind of fast food a man could imagine, as long as it was a hamburger; and he reached the Motel America without incident.

Every hour wounds. The last one kills.
-OLD SAYING 
There was a thin young woman behind the counter at the Motel America. She told Shadow he had already been checked in by his friend, and gave him his rectangular plastic room key. She had pale blonde hair and a rodent-like quality to her face that was most apparent when she looked suspicious, and eased when she smiled. Most of the time she looked at Shadow, she looked suspicious. She refused to tell him Wednesday's room number, and insisted on telephoning Wednesday on the house phone to let him know his guest was here.
Wednesday came out of a room down the hall, and beckoned to Shadow.
""How was the funeral?"" he asked.
""It's over,"" said Shadow.
""That shitty, huh? You want to talk about it?""
""No,"" said Shadow.
""Good."" Wednesday grinned. ""Too much talking these days. Talk talk talk. This country would get along much better if people learned how to suffer in silence. You hungry?""
""A little.""
""There's no food here. But you can order a pizza and they'll put it on the room.""
Wednesday led the way back to his room, which was across the hall from Shadow's. There were maps all over the room, unfolded, spread out on the bed, taped to the walls. Wednesday had drawn all over the maps in bright marking pens, fluorescent greens and painful pinks and vivid oranges.
""I got hijacked by a fat kid in a limo,"" said Shadow. ""He says to tell you that you have been consigned to the dung heap of history while people like him ride in their limos down the superhighways of life. Something like that.""
""Little snot,"" said Wednesday.
""You know him?""
Wednesday shrugged. ""I know who he is."" He sat down, heavily, on the room's only chair. ""They don't have a clue,"" he said. ""They don't have a fucking clue. How much longer do you need to stay in town?""
""I don't know. Maybe another week. I guess I need to wrap up Laura's affairs. Take care of the apartment, get rid of her clothes, all that. It'll drive her mother nuts, but the woman deserves it.""
Wednesday nodded his huge head. ""Well, the sooner you're done, the sooner we can move out of Eagle Point. Good night.""
Shadow walked across the hall. His room was a duplicate of Wednesday's room, down to the print of a bloody sunset on the wall above the bed. He ordered a cheese and meatball pizza, then he ran a bath, pouring all the motel's little plastic bottles of shampoo into the water, making it foam.
He was too big to lie down in the bathtub, but he sat in it and luxuriated as best he could. Shadow had promised himself a bath when he got out of prison, and Shadow kept his promises.
The pizza arrived shortly after he got out of the bath, and Shadow ate it, washing it down with a can of root beer.
He turned on the television, and watched an episode of Jerry Springer he remembered from before he went to prison. The theme of the show was ""I want to be a prostitute"" and several would-be whores, most of them female, were brought out, shouted at and hectored by the audience; then a gold-draped pimp came out and offered them employment in his stable, and an ex-hooker ran out and pleaded with them all to get real jobs. Shadow turned it off before Jerry got to his thought for the day.
Shadow lay in bed, thinking, This is my first bed as a free man, and the thought gave him less pleasure than he had imagined that it would. He left the drapes open, watched the lights of the cars and of the fast food joints through the window glass, comforted to know there was another world out there, one he could walk to any time he wanted.
Shadow could have been in his bed at home, he thought, in the apartment that he had shared with Laura-in the bed that he had shared with Laura. But the thought of being there without her, surrounded by her things, her scent, her life, was simply too painful...
Don't go there, thought Shadow. He decided to think about something else. He thought about coin tricks. Shadow knew that he did not have the personality to be a magician: he could not weave the stories that were so necessary for belief, nor did he wish to do card tricks, or produce paper flowers. But he liked to manipulate coins; he enjoyed the craft of it. He started to list the coin vanishes he had mastered, which reminded him of the coin he had tossed into Laura's grave, and then, in his head, Audrey was telling him that Laura had died with Robbie's cock in her mouth, and once again he felt a small hurt in his chest. In his heart.
Every hour wounds. The last one kills. Where had he heard that? He could no longer remember. He could feel, somewhere deep inside him, anger and pain building, a knot of tension at the base of his skull, a tightness at the temples. He breathed in through his nose, out through his mouth, forcing himself to let the tension go.
He thought of Wednesday's comment and smiled, despite himself: Shadow had heard too many people telling each other not to repress their feelings, to let their emotions out, let the pain go. Shadow thought there was a lot to be said for bottling up emotions. If you did it long enough and deep enough, he suspected, pretty soon you wouldn't feel anything at all.
Sleep took him then, without Shadow noticing.
He was walking...
He was walking through a room bigger than a city, and everywhere he looked there were statues and carvings and rough-hewn images. He was standing beside a statue of a woman-like thing: her naked breasts hung, flat and pendulous on her chest, around her waist was a chain of severed hands, both of her own hands held sharp knives, and, instead of a head, rising from her neck there were twin serpents, their bodies arched, facing each other, ready to attack. There was something profoundly disturbing about the statue, a deep and violent wrongness. Shadow backed away from it.
He began to walk through the hall. The carved eyes of those statues that had eyes seemed to follow his every step.
In his dream, he realized that each statue had a name burning on the floor in front of it. The man with the white hair, with a necklace of teeth about his neck, holding a drum, was Leucotios; the broad-hipped woman, with monsters dropping from the vast gash between her legs, was Hubur; the ram-headed man holding the golden ball was Hershef.
A precise voice, fussy and exact, was speaking to him, in his dream, but he could see no one.
""These are gods who have been forgotten, and now might as well be dead. They can be found only in dry histories. They are gone, all gone, but their names and their images remain with us.""
Shadow turned a corner, and knew himself to be in another room, even vaster than the first. It went on further than the eye could see. Close to him was the skull of a mammoth, polished and brown, and a hairy ochre cloak, being worn by a small woman with a deformed left hand. Next to that were three women, each carved from the same granite boulder, joined at the waist: their faces had an unfinished, hasty look to them, although their breasts and genitalia had been carved with elaborate care; and there was a flightless bird which Shadow did not recognize, twice his height, with a beak made for rending, like a vulture's, but with human arms: and on, and on.
The voice spoke once more, as if it were addressing a class, saying, ""These are the gods who have passed out of memory. Even their names are lost. The people who worshiped them are as forgotten as their gods. Their totems are long since broken and cast down. Their last priests died without passing on their secrets.
""Gods die. And when they truly die they are unmourned and unremembered. Ideas are more difficult to kill than people, but they can be killed, in the end.""
There was a whispering noise that began then to run through the hall, a low susurrus that caused Shadow, in his dream, to experience a chilling and inexplicable fear. An all-engulfing panic took him, there in the halls of the Gods whose very existence had been forgotten-octopus-faced gods and gods who were only mummified hands or falling rocks or forest fires...
Shadow woke with his heart jackhammering in his chest, his forehead clammy, entirely awake. The red numerals on the bedside clock told him the time was 1:03 A.M. The light of the Motel America sign outside shone through his bedroom window. Disoriented, Shadow got up and walked into the tiny motel bathroom. He pissed without turning on the lights, and returned to the bedroom. The dream was still fresh and vivid in his mind's eye, but he could not explain to himself why it had scared him so.
The light that came into the room from outside was not bright, but Shadow's eyes had become used to the dark. There was a woman sitting on the side of his bed.
He knew her. He would have known her in a crowd of a thousand, or of a hundred thousand. She sat straight on the side of his bed. She was still wearing the navy-blue suit they had buried her in.
Her voice was a whisper, but a familiar one. ""I guess,"" said Laura, ""you're going to ask what I'm doing here.""
Shadow said nothing.
He sat down on the room's only chair, and, finally, asked, ""Babe? Is that you?""
""Yes,"" she said. ""I'm cold, puppy.""
""You're dead, babe.""
""Yes,"" she said. ""Yes. I am."" She patted the bed next to her. ""Come and sit by me,"" she said.
""No,"" said Shadow. ""I think I'll stay right here for now. We have some unresolved issues to address.""
""Like me being dead?""
""Possibly, but I was thinking more of how you died. You and Robbie.""
""Oh,"" she said. ""That.""
Shadow could smell-or perhaps, he thought, he simply imagined that he smelled-an odor of rot, of flowers and preservatives. His wife-his ex-wife...no, he corrected himself, his late wife...sat on the bed and stared at him, unblinking.
""Puppy,"" she said. ""Could you-do you think you could possibly get me-a cigarette?""
""I thought you gave them up.""
""I did,"" she said. ""But I'm no longer concerned about the health risks. And I think it would calm my nerves. There's a machine in the lobby.""
Shadow pulled on his jeans and a T-shirt and went, barefoot, into the lobby. The night clerk was a middle-aged man, reading a book by John Grisham. Shadow bought a pack of Virginia Slims from the machine. He asked the night clerk for a book of matches.
The man stared at him, asked for his room number. Shadow told him. The man nodded. ""You're in a non-smoking room,"" he said. ""You make sure you open the window, now."" He passed Shadow a book of matches and a plastic ashtray with the Motel America logo on it.
""Got it,"" said Shadow.
He went back into his bedroom. He did not turn the light on. His wife was still on the bed. She had stretched out now, on top of his rumpled covers. Shadow opened the window and then passed her the cigarettes and the matches. Her fingers were cold. She lit a match and he saw that her nails, usually pristine, were battered and chewed, and there was mud under them.
Laura lit the cigarette, inhaled, blew out the match. She took another puff. ""I can't taste it,"" she said. ""I don't think this is doing anything.""
""I'm sorry,"" he said.
""Me too,"" said Laura.
When she inhaled the cigarette tip glowed, and he was able to see her face.
""So,"" she said. ""They let you out.""
""Yes.""
""How was prison?""
""Could have been worse.""
""Yes."" The tip of the cigarette glowed orange. ""I'm still grateful. I should never have got you mixed up in it.""
""Well,"" he said, ""I agreed to do it. I could have said no."" He wondered why he wasn't scared of her: why a dream of a museum could leave him terrified, while he seemed to be coping with a walking corpse without fear.
""Yes,"" she said. ""You could have. You big galoot."" Smoke wreathed her face. She was very beautiful in the dim light. ""You want to know about me and Robbie?""
""Yes."" It was Laura, he realized. Living or dead, he couldn't fear her.
She stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray. ""You were in prison,"" she said. ""And I needed someone to talk to. I needed a shoulder to cry on. You weren't there. I was upset.""
""I'm sorry."" Shadow realized something was different about her voice, and he tried to figure out what it was.
""I know. So we'd meet for coffee. Talk about what we'd do when you got out of prison. How good it would be to see you again. He really liked you, you know. He was looking forward to giving you back your old job.""
""Yes.""
""And then Audrey went to visit her sister for a week. This was, oh, a year, thirteen months after you'd gone away."" Her voice lacked expression; each word was flat and dull, like pebbles dropped, one by one, into a deep well. ""Robbie came over. We got drunk together. We did it on the floor of the bedroom. It was good. It was really good.""
""I didn't need to hear that.""
""No? I'm sorry. It's harder to pick and choose when you're dead. It's like a photograph, you know. It doesn't matter as much.""
""It matters to me.""
Laura lit a second cigarette. Her movements were fluid and competent, not stiff. Shadow wondered, for a moment, if she was dead at all. Perhaps this was some kind of elaborate trick. ""Yes,"" she said. ""I see that. Well, we carried on our affair-although we didn't call it that, we did not call it anything-for most of the last two years.""
""Were you going to leave me for him?""
""Why would I do that? You're my big bear. You're my puppy. You did what you did for me. I waited three years for you to come back to me. I love you.""
He stopped himself from saying I love you, too. He wasn't going to say that. Not any more. ""So what happened the other night?""
""The night I was killed?""
""Yes.""
""Well, Robbie and I went out to talk about your welcome-back surprise party. It would have been so good. And I told him that we were done. Finished. That now that you were back that was the way it had to be.""
""Mm. Thank you, babe.""
""You're welcome, darling."" The ghost of a smile crossed her face. ""We got maudlin. It was sweet. We got stupid. I got very drunk. He didn't. He had to drive. We were driving home and I announced that I was going to give him a goodbye blowjob, one last time with feeling, and I unzipped his pants, and I did.""
""Big mistake.""
""Tell me about it. I knocked the gearshift with my shoulder, and then Robbie was trying to push me out of the way to put the car back in gear, and we were swerving, and there was a loud crunch and I remember the world started to roll and to spin, and I thought, I'm going to die. It was very dispassionate. I remember that. I wasn't scared. And then I don't remember anything more.""
There was a smell like burning plastic. It was the cigarette, Shadow realized: it had burned down to the filter. Laura did not seem to have noticed.
""What are you doing here, Laura?""
""Can't a wife come and see her husband?""
""You're dead. I went to your funeral this afternoon.""
""Yes."" She stopped talking, stared into nothing. Shadow stood up and walked over to her. He took the smoldering cigarette butt from her fingers and threw it out of the window.
""Well?""
Her eyes sought his. ""I don't know much more than I did when I was alive. Most of the stuff I know now that I didn't know then I can't put into words.""
""Normally people who die stay in their graves,"" said Shadow.
""Do they? Do they really, puppy? I used to think they did too. Now I'm not so sure. Perhaps."" She climbed off the bed and walked over to the window. Her face, in the light of the motel sign, was as beautiful as it had ever been. The face of the woman he had gone to prison for.
His heart hurt in his chest as if someone had taken it in a fist and squeezed. ""Laura...?""
She did not look at him. ""You've gotten yourself mixed up in some bad things, Shadow. You're going to screw it up, if someone isn't there to watch out for you. I'm watching out for you. And thank you for my present.""
""What present?""
She reached into the pocket of her blouse, and pulled out the gold coin he had thrown into the grave earlier that day. There was still black dirt on it. ""I may have it put on a chain. It was very sweet of you.""
""You're welcome.""
She turned then and looked at him with eyes that seemed both to see and not to see him. ""I think there are several aspects of our marriage we're going to have to work on.""
""Babes,"" he told her. ""You're dead.""
""That's one of those aspects, obviously."" She paused. ""Okay,"" she said. ""I'm going now. It will be better if I go."" And, naturally and easily, she turned and put her hands on Shadow's shoulders, and went up on tiptoes to kiss him goodbye, as she had always kissed him goodbye.
Awkwardly he bent to kiss her on the cheek, but she moved her mouth as he did so and pushed her lips against his. Her breath smelled, faintly, of mothballs.
Laura's tongue flickered into Shadow's mouth. It was cold, and dry, and it tasted of cigarettes and of bile. If Shadow had had any doubts as to whether his wife was dead or not, they ended then.
He pulled back.
""I love you,"" she said, simply. ""I'll be looking out for you."" She walked over to the motel room door. There was a strange taste in his mouth. ""Get some sleep, puppy,"" she told him. ""And stay out of trouble.""
She opened the door to the hall. The fluorescent light in the hallway was not kind: beneath it, Laura looked dead, but then, it did that to every one.
""You could have asked me to stay the night,"" she said, in her cold-stone voice.
""I don't think I could,"" said Shadow.
""You will, hon,"" she said. ""Before all this is over. You will."" She turned away from him, and walked down the corridor.
Shadow looked out of the doorway. The night clerk kept on reading his John Grisham novel, and barely looked up as she walked past him. There was thick graveyard mud clinging to her shoes. And then she was gone.
Shadow breathed out, a slow sigh. His heart was pounding arrhythmically in his chest. He walked across the hall, and knocked on Wednesday's door. As he knocked he got the weirdest notion: that he was being buffeted by black wings, as if an enormous crow was flying through him, out into the hall and the world beyond.
Wednesday opened the door. He had a white motel towel wrapped around his waist, but was otherwise naked. ""What the hell do you want?"" he asked.
""Something you should know,"" said Shadow. ""Maybe it was a dream-but it wasn't-or maybe I inhaled some of the fat kid's synthetic toad-skin smoke, or probably I'm just going mad...""
""Yeah, yeah. Spit it out,"" said Wednesday. ""I'm kind of in the middle of something here.""
Shadow glanced into the room. He could see someone in the bed, watching him. A sheet pulled up over small breasts. Pale blonde hair, something rattish about the face. The girl from the motel desk. He lowered his voice. ""I just saw my wife,"" he said. ""She was in my room.""
""A ghost, you mean? You saw a ghost?""
""No. Not a ghost. She was solid. It was her. She's dead all right, but it wasn't any kind of a ghost. I touched her. She kissed me.""
""I see."" Wednesday darted a look at the woman in the bed. ""Be right back, m'dear,"" he said.
They crossed the hall to Shadow's room. Wednesday turned on the lamps. He looked at the cigarette butt in the ashtray. He scratched his chest. His nipples were dark, old-man nipples, and his chest hair was grizzled. There was a white scar down one side of his torso. He sniffed the air. Then he shrugged.
""Okay,"" he said. ""So your dead wife showed up. You scared?""
""A little.""
""Very wise. The dead always give me the screaming mimis. Anything else?""
""I'm ready to leave Eagle Point. Laura's mother can sort out the apartment, all that. She hates me anyway. I'm ready to go when you are.""
Wednesday smiled. ""Good news, my boy. We'll leave in the morning. Now, you should get some sleep. I have some scotch in my room, if you need help sleeping. Yes?""
""No. I'll be fine.""
""Then do not disturb me further. I have a long night ahead of me.""
""No sleep?"" asked Shadow, smiling.
""I don't sleep. It's overrated. A bad habit I do my best to avoid-in company, wherever possible, and the young lady may go off the boil if I don't get back to her.""
""Good night,"" said Shadow.
""Exactly,"" said Wednesday, and he closed the door as he went out.
Shadow sat down on the bed. The smell of cigarettes and preservatives lingered in the air. He wished that he were mourning Laura: it seemed more appropriate than being troubled by her or, he admitted it to himself now that she had gone, just a little scared by her. It was time to mourn. He turned the lights out, and lay on the bed, and thought of Laura as she was before he went to prison. He remembered their marriage when they were young and happy and stupid and unable to keep their hands off each other.
It had been a very long time since Shadow had cried, so long he thought he had forgotten how. He had not even cried when his mother died. But he began to cry then, in painful, lurching sobs. He missed Laura and the days that were forever gone.
For the first time since he was a small boy, Shadow cried himself to sleep.
Coming to America 813 A.D. 
They navigated the green sea by the stars and by the shore, and when the shore was only a memory and the night sky was overcast and dark they navigated by faith, and they called on the all-father to bring them safely to land once more.
A bad journey they had of it, their fingers numb and with a shiver in their bones that not even wine could burn off. They would wake in the morning to see that the rime had frosted their beards, and, until the sun warmed them, they looked like old men, white-bearded before their time.
Teeth were loosening and eyes were deep-sunken in their sockets when they made landfall on the green land to the West. The men said, ""We are far, far from our homes and our hearths, far from the seas we know and the lands we love. Here on the edge of the world we will be forgotten by our gods.""
Their leader clambered to the top of a great rock, and he mocked them for their lack of faith. ""The all-father made the world,"" he shouted. ""He built it with his hands from the shattered bones and the flesh of Ymir, his grandfather. He placed Ymir's brains in the sky as clouds, and his salt blood became the seas we crossed. If he made the world, do you not realize that he created this land as well? And if we die here as men, shall we not be received into his hall?""
And the men cheered and laughed. They set to, with a will, to build a hall out of split trees and mud, inside a small stockade of sharpened logs, although as far as they knew they were the only men in the new land.
On the day that the hall was finished there was a storm: the sky at midday became as dark as night, and the sky was rent with forks of white flame, and the thunder-crashes were so loud that the men were almost deafened by them, and the ship's cat they had brought with them for good fortune hid beneath their beached longboat. The storm was hard enough and vicious enough that the men laughed and clapped each other on the back, and they said, ""The thunderer is here with us, in this distant land,"" and they gave thanks, and rejoiced, and they drank until they were reeling.
In the smoky darkness of their hall, that night, the bard sang them the old songs. He sang of Odin, the all-father, who was sacrificed to himself as bravely and as nobly as others were sacrificed to him. He sang of the nine days that the all-father hung from the world-tree, his side pierced and dripping from the spear-point (at this point his song became, for a moment, a scream), and he sang them all the things the all-father had learned in his agony: nine names, and nine runes, and twice-nine charms. When he told them of the spear piercing Odin's side, the bard shrieked in pain, as the all-father himself had called out in his agony, and all the men shivered, imagining his pain.
They found the scraeling the following day, which was the all-father's own day. He was a small man, his long hair black as a crow's wing, his skin the color of rich red clay. He spoke in words none of them could understand, not even their bard, who had been on a ship that had sailed through the pillars of Hercules, and who could speak the trader's pidgin men spoke all across the Mediterranean. The stranger was dressed in feathers and in furs, and there were small bones braided into his long hair.
They led him into their encampment, and they gave him roasted meat to eat, and strong drink to quench his thirst. They laughed riotously at the man as he stumbled and sang, at the way his head rolled and lolled, and this on less than a drinking-horn of mead. They gave him more drink, and soon enough he lay beneath the table with his head curled under his arm.
Then they picked him up, a man at each shoulder, a man at each leg, carried him at shoulder height, the four men making him an eight-legged horse, and they carried him at the head of a procession to an ash tree on the hill overlooking the bay, where they put a rope around his neck and hung him high in the wind, their tribute to the all-father, the gallows lord. The scraeling's body swung in the wind, his face blackening, his tongue protruding, his eyes popping, his penis hard enough to hang a leather helmet on, while the men cheered and shouted and laughed, proud to be sending their sacrifice to the Heavens.
And, the next day, when two huge ravens landed upon the scraeling's corpse, one on each shoulder, and commenced to peck at its cheeks and eyes, the men knew their sacrifice had been accepted.
It was a long winter, and they were hungry, but they were cheered by the thought that, when spring came, they would send the boat back to the northlands, and it would bring settlers, and bring women. As the weather became colder, and the days became shorter, some of the men took to searching for the scraeling village, hoping to find food, and women. They found nothing, save for the places where fires had been, where small encampments had been abandoned.
One midwinter's day, when the sun was as distant and cold as a dull silver coin, they saw that the remains of the scraeling's body had been removed from the ash tree. That afternoon it began to snow, in huge, slow flakes.
The men from the northlands closed the gates of their encampment, retreated behind their wooden wall.
The scraeling war party fell upon them that night: five hundred men to thirty. They climbed the wall, and, over the following seven days, they killed each of the thirty men, in thirty different ways. And the sailors were forgotten, by history and their people.
The wall they tore down, and the village they burned. The longboat, upside-down and pulled high on the shingle, they also burned, hoping that the pale strangers had but one boat, and that by burning it they were ensuring that no other Northmen would come to their shores.
It was more than a hundred years before Leif the Fortunate, son of Erik the Red, rediscovered that land, which he would call Vineland. His gods were already waiting for him when he arrived: Tyr, one-handed, and gray Odin gallows-god, and Thor of the thunders.
They were there.
They were waiting.

Let the Midnight Special
Shine its light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine its ever-lovin' light on me
-""THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL,"" TRADITIONAL SONG 
Shadow and Wednesday ate breakfast at a Country Kitchen across the street from their motel. It was eight in the morning, and the world was misty and chill.
""You still ready to leave Eagle Point?"" asked Wednesday, at the breakfast bar. ""I have some calls to make, if you are. Friday today. Friday's a free day. A woman's day. Saturday tomorrow. Much to do on Saturday.""
""I'm ready,"" said Shadow. ""Nothing keeping me here.""
Wednesday heaped his plate high with several kinds of breakfast meats. Shadow took some melon, a bagel, and a packet of cream cheese. They went and sat down in a booth.
""That was some dream you had last night,"" said Wednesday.
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""It was."" Laura's muddy footprints had been visible on the motel carpet when he got up that morning, leading from his bedroom to the lobby and out the door.
""So,"" said Wednesday. ""Why'd they call you Shadow?""
Shadow shrugged. ""It's a name,"" he said. Outside the plate glass the world in the mist had become a pencil drawing executed in a dozen different grays with, here and there, a smudge of electric red or pure white. ""How'd you lose your eye?""
Wednesday shoveled half a dozen pieces of bacon into his mouth, chewed, wiped the fat from his lips with the back of his hand. ""Didn't lose it,"" he said. ""I still know exactly where it is.""
""So what's the plan?""
Wednesday looked thoughtful. He ate several vivid pink slices of ham, picked a fragment of meat from his beard, dropped it onto his plate. ""Plan is as follows. On Saturday night, which, as I have already remarked, is tomorrow, we shall be meeting with a number of persons preeminent in their respective fields-do not let their demeanor intimidate you. We shall meet at one of the most important places in the entire country. Afterward we shall wine and dine them. There will be, at a guess, thirty or forty of them. Perhaps more. I need to enlist them in my current enterprise.""
""And where is the most important place in the country?""
""One of them, m'boy. I said one of them. Opinions are justifiably divided. I have sent word to my colleagues. We'll stop off in Chicago on the way, as I need to pick up some money. Entertaining, in the manner we shall need to entertain, will take more ready cash than I happen to have available. Then on to Madison.""
""I see.""
""No, you don't. But all will become clear in time.""
Wednesday paid and they left, walked back across the road to the motel parking lot. Wednesday tossed Shadow the car keys. He drove down to the freeway and out of town.
""You going to miss it?"" asked Wednesday. He was sorting through a folder filled with maps.
""The town? No. Too many Laura memories. I didn't really ever have a life here. I was never in one place too long as a kid, and I didn't get here until I was in my twenties. So this town is Laura's.""
""Let's hope she stays here,"" said Wednesday.
""It was a dream,"" said Shadow. ""Remember.""
""That's good,"" said Wednesday. ""Healthy attitude to have. Did you fuck her last night?""
Shadow took a breath. Then, ""That is none of your damn business. And no.""
""Did you want to?""
Shadow said nothing at all. He drove north, toward Chicago. Wednesday chuckled, and began to pore over his maps, unfolding and refolding them, making occasional notes on a yellow legal pad with a large silver ballpoint pen.
Eventually he was finished. He put his pen away, put the folder on the back seat. ""The best thing about the states we're heading for,"" said Wednesday, ""Minnesota, Wisconsin, all around there, is it has the kind of women I liked when I was younger. Pale-skinned and blue-eyed, hair so fair it's almost white, wine-colored lips, and round, full breasts with the veins running through them like a good cheese.""
""Only when you were younger?"" asked Shadow. ""Looked like you were doing pretty good last night.""
""Yes."" Wednesday smiled. ""Would you like to know the secret of my success?""
""You pay them?""
""Nothing so crude. No, the secret is charm. Pure and simple.""
""Charm, huh? Well, like they say, you either got it or you ain't.""
""Charms can be learnt,"" said Wednesday.
""So where are we going?"" asked Shadow.
""There's an old friend of mine we need to talk to. He's one of the people who'll be coming to the get-together. Old man, now. He's expecting us for dinner.""
They drove north and west, toward Chicago.
""Whatever's happening with Laura,"" said Shadow, breaking the silence. ""Is it your fault? Did you make it happen?""
""No,"" said Wednesday.
""Like the kid in the car asked me: would you tell me if it was?""
""I'm as puzzled as you are.""
Shadow tuned the radio to an oldies station, and listened to songs that were current before he was born. Bob Dylan sang about a hard rain that was going to fall, and Shadow wondered if that rain had fallen yet, or if it was something that was still going to happen. The road ahead of them was empty and the ice crystals on the asphalt glittered like diamonds in the morning sun.
  
Chicago happened slowly, like a migraine. First they were driving through countryside, then, imperceptibly, the occasional town became a low suburban sprawl, and the sprawl became the city.
They parked outside a squat black brownstone. The sidewalk was clear of snow. They walked to the lobby. Wednesday pressed the top button on the gouged metal intercom box. Nothing happened. He pressed it again. Then, experimentally, he began to press the other buttons, for other tenants, with no response.
""It's dead,"" said a gaunt old woman, coming down the steps. ""Doesn't work. We call the super, ask him when he going to fix, when he going to mend the heating, he does not care, goes to Arizona for the winter for his chest."" Her accent was thick, Eastern European, Shadow guessed.
Wednesday bowed low. ""Zorya, my dear, may I say how unutterably beautiful you look? A radiant creature. You have not aged.""
The old woman glared at him. ""He don't want to see you. I don't want to see you neither. You bad news.""
""That's because I don't come if it isn't important.""
The woman sniffed. She carried an empty string shopping bag, and wore an old red coat, buttoned up to her chin, and, perched on her gray hair, a green velvet hat that was, in appearance, a little bit flowerpot, a little bit bread-loaf. She looked at Shadow suspiciously.
""Who is the big man?"" she asked Wednesday. ""Another one of your murderers?""
""You do me a deep disservice, good lady. This gentleman is called Shadow. He is working for me, yes, but on your behalf. Shadow, may I introduce you to the lovely Miss Zorya Vechernyaya.""
""Good to meet you,"" said Shadow.
Bird-like, the old woman peered up at him. ""Shadow,"" she said. ""A good name. When the shadows are long, that is my time. And you are the long shadow."" She looked him up and down, then she smiled. ""You may kiss my hand,"" she said, and extended a cold hand to him.
Shadow bent down and kissed her thin hand. She had a large amber ring on her middle finger.
""Good boy,"" she said. ""I am going to buy groceries. You see, I am the only one of us who brings in any money. The other two cannot make money fortune-telling. This is because they only tell the truth, and the truth is not what people want to hear. It is a bad thing, and it troubles people, so they do not come back. But I can lie to them, tell them what they want to hear. I tell the pretty fortunes. So I bring home the bread. Do you think you will be here for supper?""
""I would hope so,"" said Wednesday.
""Then you had better give me some money to buy more food,"" she said. ""I am proud, but I am not stupid. The others are prouder than I am, and he is the proudest of all. So give me money and do not tell them that you give me money.""
Wednesday opened his wallet, and reached in. He took out a twenty. Zorya Vechernyaya plucked it from his fingers, and waited. He took out another twenty and gave it to her.
""Is good,"" she said. ""We will feed you like princes. Like we would feed our own father. Now, go up the stairs to the top. Zorya Utrennyaya is awake, but our other sister is still asleep, so do not be making too much noise, when you get to the top.""
Shadow and Wednesday climbed the dark stairs. The landing two stories up was half-filled with black plastic garbage bags and it smelled of rotting vegetables.
""Are they gypsies?"" asked Shadow.
""Zorya and her family? Not at all. They're not Rom. They're Russian. Slavs, I believe.""
""But she does fortune-telling.""
""Lots of people do fortune-telling. I dabble in it myself."" Wednesday was panting as they went up the final flight of stairs. ""I'm out of condition.""
The landing at the top of the stairs ended in a single door painted red, with a peephole in it.
Wednesday knocked at the door. There was no response. He knocked again, louder this time.
""Okay! Okay! I heard you! I heard you!"" The sound of locks being undone, of bolts being pulled, the rattle of a chain. The red door opened a crack.
""Who is it?"" A man's voice, old and cigarette-roughened.
""An old friend, Czernobog. With an associate.""
The door opened as far as the security chain would allow. Shadow could see a gray face, in the shadows, peering out at them. ""What do you want, Grimnir?""
""Initially, simply the pleasure of your company. And I have information to share. What's that phrase...oh yes. You may learn something to your advantage.""
The door opened all the way. The man in the dusty bathrobe was short, with iron-gray hair and craggy features. He wore gray pinstripe pants, shiny from age, and slippers. He held an unfiltered cigarette with square-tipped fingers, sucking the tip while keeping it cupped in his fist-like a convict, thought Shadow, or a soldier. He extended his left hand to Wednesday.
""Welcome then, Grimnir.""
""They call me Wednesday these days,"" he said, shaking the old man's hand.
A narrow smile; a flash of yellow teeth. ""Yes,"" he said. ""Very funny. And this is?""
""This is my associate. Shadow, meet Mr. Czernobog.""
""Well met,"" said Czernobog. He shook Shadow's left hand with his own. His hands were rough and callused, and the tips of his fingers were as yellow as if they had been dipped in iodine.
""How do you do, Mr. Czernobog.""
""I do old. My guts ache, and my back hurts, and I cough my chest apart every morning.""
""Why you are standing at the door?"" asked a woman's voice. Shadow looked over Czernobog's shoulder, at the old woman standing behind him. She was smaller and frailer than her sister, but her hair was long and still golden. ""I am Zorya Utrennyaya,"" she said. ""You must not stand there in the hall. You must come in, go through to the sitting room, through there, I will bring you coffee, go, go in, through there.""
Through the doorway into an apartment that smelled like over-boiled cabbage and cat-box and unfiltered foreign cigarettes, and they were ushered through a tiny hallway past several closed doors to the sitting room at the far end of the corridor, and were seated on a huge old horsehair sofa, disturbing an elderly gray cat in the process, who stretched, stood up, and walked, stiffly, to a distant part of the sofa, where he lay down, warily stared at each of them in turn, then closed one eye and went back to sleep. Czernobog sat in an armchair across from them.
Zorya Utrennyaya found an empty ashtray and placed it beside Czernobog. ""How you want your coffee?"" she asked her guests. ""Here we take it black as night, sweet as sin.""
""That'll be fine, ma'am,"" said Shadow. He looked out of the window, at the buildings across the street.
Zorya Utrennyaya went out. Czernobog stared at her as she left. ""That's a good woman,"" he said. ""Not like her sisters. One of them is a harpy, the other, all she does is sleep."" He put his slippered feet up on a long, low coffee table, a chess board inset in the middle, cigarette burns and mug rings on its surface.
""Is she your wife?"" asked Shadow.
""She's nobody's wife."" The old man sat in silence for a moment, looking down at his rough hands. ""No. We are all relatives. We come over here together, long time ago.""
From the pocket of his bathrobe, Czernobog produced a pack of unfiltered cigarettes. Shadow did not recognize the brand. Wednesday pulled out a narrow gold lighter from the pocket of his pale suit, and lit the old man's cigarette. ""First we come to New York,"" said Czernobog. ""All our countrymen go to New York. Then, we come out here, to Chicago. Everything got very bad. In the old country, they had nearly forgotten me. Here, I am a bad memory no one wants to remember. You know what I did when I got to Chicago?""
""No,"" said Shadow.
""I get a job in the meat business. On the kill floor. When the steer comes up the ramp, I was a knocker. You know why we are called knockers? Is because we take the sledgehammer and we knock the cow down with it. Bam! It takes strength in the arms. Yes? Then the shackler chains the beef up, hauls it up, then they cut the throat. They drain the blood first before they cut the head off. We were the strongest, the knockers."" He pushed up the sleeve of his bathrobe, flexed his upper arm to display the muscles still visible under the old skin. ""Is not just strong though. There was an art to it. To the blow. Otherwise the cow is just stunned, or angry. Then, in the fifties, they give us the bolt gun. You put it to the forehead, bam! Bam! Now you think, anybody can kill. Not so."" He mimed putting a metal bolt through a cow's head. ""It still takes skill."" He smiled at the memory, displaying an iron-colored tooth.
""Don't tell them cow-killing stories."" Zorya Utrennyaya carried in their coffee on a red wooden tray. Small brightly enameled cups filled with a brown liquid so dark it was almost black. She gave them each a cup, then sat beside Czernobog.
""Zorya Vechernyaya is doing shopping,"" she said. ""She will be soon back.""
""We met her downstairs,"" said Shadow. ""She says she tells fortunes.""
""Yes,"" said her sister. ""In the twilight, that is the time for lies. I do not tell good lies, so I am a poor fortune-teller. And our sister, Zorya Polunochnaya, she can tell no lies at all.""
The coffee was even sweeter and stronger than Shadow had expected.
Shadow excused himself to use the bathroom-a cramped, closet-like room near the front door, hung with several brown-spotted framed photographs. It was early afternoon, but already the daylight was beginning to fade. He heard voices raised from down the hall. He washed his hands in icy-cold water with a sickly-smelling sliver of pink soap.
Czernobog was standing in the hall as Shadow came out.
""You bring trouble!"" he was shouting. ""Nothing but trouble! I will not listen! You will get out of my house!""
Wednesday was still sitting on the sofa, sipping his coffee, stroking the gray cat. Zorya Utrennyaya stood on the thin carpet, one hand nervously twining in and out of her long yellow hair.
""Is there a problem?"" asked Shadow.
""He is the problem!"" shouted Czernobog. ""He is! You tell him that there is nothing will make me help him! I want him to go! I want him out of here! Both of you go!""
""Please,"" said Zorya Utrennyaya, ""please be quiet, you wake up Zorya Polunochnaya.""
""You are like him, you want me to join his madness!"" shouted Czernobog. He looked as if he was on the verge of tears. A pillar of ash tumbled from his cigarette onto the threadbare hall carpet.
Wednesday stood up, walked over to Czernobog. He rested his hand on Czernobog's shoulder. ""Listen,"" he said, peaceably. ""Firstly, it's not madness. It's the only way. Secondly, everyone will be there. You would not want to be left out, would you?""
""You know who I am,"" said Czernobog. ""You know what these hands have done. You want my brother, not me. And he's gone.""
A door in the hallway opened, and a sleepy female voice said, ""Is something wrong?""
""Nothing is wrong, my sister,"" said Zorya Utrennyaya. ""Go back to sleep."" Then she turned to Czernobog. ""See? See what you do with all your shouting? You go back in there and sit down. Sit!"" Czernobog looked as if he were about to protest; and then the fight went out of him. He looked frail, suddenly: frail, and lonely.
The three men went back into the shabby sitting room. There was a brown nicotine ring around that room that ended about a foot from the ceiling, like the tide-line in an old bathtub.
""It doesn't have to be for you,"" said Wednesday to Czernobog, unfazed. ""If it is for your brother, it's for you as well. That's one place you dualistic types have it over the rest of us, eh?""
Czernobog said nothing.
""Talking of Bielebog, have you heard anything from him?""
Czernobog shook his head. Then he spoke, staring down at the threadbare carpet. ""None of us have heard of him. I am almost forgotten, but still, they remember me a little, here and in the old country."" He looked up at Shadow. ""Do you have a brother?""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""Not that I know of.""
""I have a brother. They say, you put us together, we are like one person, you know? When we are young, his hair, it is very blond, very light, and people say, he is the good one. And my hair it is very dark, darker than yours even, and people say I am the rogue, you know? I am the bad one. And now time passes, and my hair is gray. His hair, too, I think, is gray. And you look at us, you would not know who was light, who was dark.""
""Were you close?"" asked Shadow.
""Close?"" asked Czernobog. ""No. We were not close. How could we be? We cared about such different things.""
There was a clatter from the end of the hall, and Zorya Vechernyaya came in. ""Supper in one hour,"" she said. Then she went out.
Czernobog sighed. ""She thinks she is a good cook,"" he said. ""She was brought up, there were servants to cook. Now, there are no servants. There is nothing.""
""Not nothing,"" said Wednesday. ""Never nothing.""
""You,"" said Czernobog. ""I shall not listen to you."" He turned to Shadow. ""Do you play checkers?"" he asked.
""Yes,"" said Shadow.
""Good. You shall play checkers with me,"" he said, taking a wooden box of pieces from the mantelpiece, and shaking them out onto the table. ""I shall play black.""
Wednesday touched Shadow's arm. ""You don't have to do this, you know,"" he said.
""Not a problem. I want to,"" said Shadow. Wednesday shrugged, and picked up an old copy of the Reader's Digest from a small pile of yellowing magazines on the windowsill. Czernobog's brown fingers finished arranging the pieces on the squares, and the game began.
  
In the days that were to come, Shadow often found himself remembering that game. Some nights he dreamed of it. His flat, round pieces were the color of old, dirty wood, nominally white. Czernobog's were a dull, faded black. Shadow was the first to move. In his dreams, there was no conversation as they played, just the loud click as the pieces were put down, or the hiss of wood against wood as they were slid from square to adjoining square.
For the first half-dozen moves each of the men slipped pieces out onto the board, into the center, leaving the back rows untouched. There were pauses between the moves, long, chess-like pauses, while each man watched, and thought.
Shadow had played checkers in prison: it passed the time. He had played chess, too, but he was not temperamentally suited to chess. He did not like planning ahead. He preferred picking the perfect move for the moment. You could win in checkers like that, sometimes.
There was a click, as Czernobog picked up a black piece and jumped it over one of Shadow's white pieces, placing it on the square on the other side. The old man picked up Shadow's white piece and put it on the table at the side of the board.
""First blood. You have lost,"" said Czernobog. ""The game is done.""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""Game's got a long way to go yet.""
""Then would you care for a wager? A little side bet, to make it more interesting?""
""No,"" said Wednesday, without looking up from a ""Humor in Uniform"" column. ""He wouldn't.""
""I am not playing with you, old man. I play with him. So, you want to bet on the game, Mister Shadow?""
""What were you two arguing about, before?"" asked Shadow.
Czernobog raised a craggy eyebrow. ""Your master wants me to come with him. To help him with his nonsense. I would rather die.""
""You want to make a bet. Okay. If I win, you come with us.""
The old man pursed his lips. ""Perhaps,"" he said. ""But only if you take my forfeit, when you lose.""
""And that is?""
There was no change in Czernobog's expression. ""If I win, I get to knock your brains out. With the sledgehammer. First you go down on your knees. Then I hit you a blow with it, so you don't get up again."" Shadow looked at the man's old face, trying to read him. He was not joking, Shadow was certain of that: there was a hunger there for something, for pain, or death or retribution.
Wednesday closed the Reader's Digest. ""This is getting ridiculous,"" he said. ""I was wrong to come here. Shadow, we're leaving."" The gray cat, disturbed, got to its feet and leapt onto the table beside the checkers game. It stared at the pieces, then leapt down onto the floor and, tail held high, it stalked from the room.
""No,"" said Shadow. He was not scared of dying. After all, it was not as if he had anything left to live for. ""It's fine. I accept. If you win the game, you get the chance to knock my brains out with one blow of your sledgehammer."" And he moved his next white piece to the adjoining square on the edge of the board.
Nothing more was said, but Wednesday did not pick up his Reader's Digest again. He watched the game with his glass eye and his true eye, with an expression that betrayed nothing.
Czernobog took another of Shadow's pieces. Shadow took two of Czernobog's. From the corridor came the smell of unfamiliar foods cooking. While not all of the smells were appetizing, Shadow realized suddenly how hungry he was.
The two men moved their pieces, black and white, turn and turn-about. A flurry of pieces taken, a blossoming of two-piece-high kings: no longer forced to move only forward on the board, a sideways slip at a time, the kings could move forward or back, which made them doubly dangerous. They had reached the furthest row, and could go where they wanted. Czernobog had three kings, Shadow had two.
Czernobog moved one of his kings around the board, eliminating Shadow's remaining pieces, while using the other two kings to keep Shadow's pieces pinned down.
And then Czernobog made a fourth king, and returned down the board to Shadow's two kings, and, unsmiling, took them both. And that was that.
""So,"" said Czernobog. ""I get to knock out your brains. And you will go on your knees willingly. Is good."" He reached out an old hand, and patted Shadow's arm with it.
""We've still got time before dinner's ready,"" said Shadow. ""You want another game? Same terms?""
Czernobog lit another cigarette, from a kitchen box of matches. ""How can it be same terms? You want I should kill you twice?""
""Right now, you have one blow, that's all. You told me yourself that it's not just strength, it's skill too. This way, if you win this game, you get two blows to my head.""
Czernobog glowered. ""One blow, is all it takes, one blow. That is the art."" He patted his upper right arm, where the muscles were, with his left, scattering gray ash from the cigarette in his left hand.
""It's been a long time. If you've lost your skill you might simply bruise me. How long has it been since you swung a killing hammer in the stock-yards? Thirty years? Forty?""
Czernobog said nothing. His closed mouth was a gray slash across his face. He tapped his fingers on the wooden table, drumming out a rhythm with them. Then he pushed the twenty-four checkers pieces back to their home squares on the board.
""Play,"" he said. ""Again, you are light. I am dark.""
Shadow pushed his first piece out. Czernobog pushed one of his own pieces forward. And it occurred to Shadow that Czernobog was going to try to play the same game again, the one that he had just won, that this would be his limitation.
This time Shadow played recklessly. He snatched tiny opportunities, moved without thinking, without a pause to consider. And this time, as he played, Shadow smiled; and whenever Czernobog moved a piece, Shadow smiled wider.
Soon, Czernobog was slamming his pieces down as he moved them, banging them down on the wooden table so hard that the remaining pieces shivered on their black squares.
""There,"" said Czernobog, taking one of Shadow's men with a crash, slamming the black piece down. ""There. What do you say to that?""
Shadow said nothing: he simply smiled, and jumped the piece that Czernobog had put down, and another, and another, and a fourth, clearing the center of the board of black pieces. He took a white piece from the pile beside the board and kinged his man.
After that, it was just a mopping-up exercise: another handful of moves, and the game was done.
Shadow said, ""Best of three?""
Czernobog simply stared at him, his gray eyes like points of steel. And then he laughed, clapped his hands on Shadow's shoulders. ""I like you!"" he exclaimed. ""You have balls.""
Then Zorya Utrennyaya put her head around the door to tell them that dinner was ready, and they should clear their game away, and put the tablecloth down on the table.
""We have no dining room,"" she said, ""I am sorry. We eat in here.""
Serving dishes were placed on the table. Each of the diners was given a small painted tray on which was some tarnished cutlery, to place on his or her lap.
Zorya Vechernyaya took five wooden bowls and placed an unpeeled boiled potato in each, then ladled in a healthy serving of a ferociously crimson borscht. She plopped a spoonful of white sour cream in, and handed the bowls to each of them.
""I thought there were six of us,"" said Shadow.
""Zorya Polunochnaya is still asleep,"" said Zorya Vechernyaya. ""We keep her food in the refrigerator. When she wakes, she will eat.""
The borscht was vinegary, and tasted like pickled beets. The boiled potato was mealy.
The next course was a leathery pot roast, accompanied by greens of some description-although they had been boiled so long and so thoroughly that they were no longer, by any stretch of the imagination, greens, and were in fact well on their way to becoming browns.
Then there were cabbage leaves stuffed with ground meat and rice, cabbage leaves of such a toughness that they were almost impossible to cut without spattering ground meat and rice all over the carpet. Shadow pushed his around his plate.
""We played checkers,"" said Czernobog, hacking himself another lump of pot roast. ""The young man and me. He won a game, I won a game. Because he won a game, I have agreed to go with him and Wednesday, and help them in their madness. And because I won a game, when this is all done, I get to kill the young man, with a blow of a hammer.""
The two Zoryas nodded gravely. ""Such a pity,"" said Zorya Vechernyaya. ""In my fortune for you, I should have said you would have a long life and a happy one, with many children.""
""That is why you are a good fortune-teller,"" said Zorya Utrennyaya. She looked sleepy, as if it were an effort for her to be up so late. ""You tell the best lies.""
It was a long meal, and at the end of it, Shadow was still hungry. Prison food had been pretty bad, and prison food was better than this.
""Good food,"" said Wednesday, who had cleaned his plate with every evidence of enjoyment. ""I thank you, ladies. And now, I am afraid that it is incumbent upon us to ask you to recommend to us a fine hotel in the neighborhood.""
Zorya Vechernyaya looked offended at this. ""Why should you go to a hotel?"" she said. ""We are not your friends?""
""I couldn't put you to any trouble..."" said Wednesday.
""Is no trouble,"" said Zorya Utrennyaya, one hand playing with her incongruously golden hair, and she yawned.
""You can sleep in Bielebog's room,"" said Zorya Vechernyaya, pointing to Wednesday. ""Is empty. And for you, young man, I make up a bed on sofa. You will be more comfortable than in feather bed. I swear.""
""That would be really kind of you,"" said Wednesday. ""We accept.""
""And you pay me only no more than what you pay for hotel,"" said Zorya Vechernyaya, with a triumphant toss of her head. ""A hundred dollars.""
""Thirty,"" said Wednesday.
""Fifty.""
""Thirty-five.""
""Forty-five.""
""Forty.""
""Is good. Forty-five dollar."" Zorya Vechernyaya reached across the table and shook Wednesday's hand. Then she began to clean the pots off the table. Zorya Utrennyaya yawned so hugely Shadow worried that she might dislocate her jaw, and announced that she was going to bed before she fell asleep with her head in the pie, and she said good night to them all.
Shadow helped Zorya Vechernyaya to take the plates and dishes into the little kitchen. To his surprise there was an elderly dishwashing machine beneath the sink, and he filled it. Zorya Vechernyaya looked over his shoulder, tutted, and removed the wooden borscht bowls.
""Those, in the sink,"" she told him.
""Sorry.""
""Is not to worry. Now, back in there, we have pie,"" she said, and she took the pie from the oven.
The pie-it was an apple pie-had been bought in a store and oven-warmed, and was very, very good indeed. The four of them ate it with ice cream, and then Zorya Vechernyaya made everyone go out of the sitting room, and made up a very fine-looking bed on the sofa for Shadow.
Wednesday spoke to Shadow as they stood in the corridor.
""What you did in there, with the checkers game,"" he said.
""Yes?""
""That was good. Very, very stupid of you. But good. Sleep safe.""
Shadow brushed his teeth and washed his face in the cold water of the little bathroom, and then walked back down the hall to the sitting room, turned out the light, and was asleep before his head touched the pillow.
  
There were explosions in Shadow's dream: he was driving a truck through a minefield, and bombs were going off on each side of him. The windshield shattered and he felt warm blood running down his face.
Someone was shooting at him.
A bullet punctured his lung, a bullet shattered his spine, another hit his shoulder. He felt each bullet strike. He collapsed across the steering wheel.
The last explosion ended in darkness.
I must be dreaming, thought Shadow, alone in the darkness. I think I just died. He remembered hearing and believing, as a child, that if you died in your dreams, you would die in real life. He did not feel dead. He opened his eyes, experimentally.
There was a woman in the little sitting room, standing against the window, with her back to him. His heart missed a half-beat, and he said, ""Laura?""
She turned, framed by the moonlight. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""I did not mean to wake you."" She had a soft, Eastern European accent. ""I will go.""
""No, it's okay,"" said Shadow. ""You didn't wake me. I had a dream.""
""Yes,"" she said. ""You were crying out, and moaning. Part of me wanted to wake you, but I thought, no, I should leave him.""
Her hair was pale and colorless in the moon's thin light. She wore a thin white cotton nightgown, with a high, lace neck, and a hem that swept the ground. Shadow sat up, entirely awake. ""You are Zorya Polu..."" He hesitated. ""The sister who was asleep.""
""I am Zorya Polunochnaya, yes. And you are called Shadow, yes? That was what Zorya Vechernyaya told me, when I woke.""
""Yes. What were you looking at, out there?""
She looked at him, then she beckoned him to join her by the window. She turned her back while he pulled on his jeans. He walked over to her. It seemed a long walk, for such a small room.
He could not tell her age. Her skin was unlined, her eyes were dark, her lashes were long, her hair was to her waist, and white. The moonlight drained colors into ghosts of themselves. She was taller than either of her sisters.
She pointed up into the night sky. ""I was looking at that,"" she said, pointing to the Big Dipper. ""See?""
""Ursa Major,"" he said. ""The Great Bear.""
""That is one way of looking at it,"" she said. ""But it is not the way from where I come from. I am going to sit on the roof. Would you like to come with me?""
""I guess,"" said Shadow.
""Is good,"" she said.
She lifted the window and clambered, barefoot, out onto the fire escape. A freezing wind blew through the window. Something was bothering Shadow, but he did not know what it was; he hesitated, then pulled on his sweater, socks, and shoes and followed her out onto the rusting fire escape. She was waiting for him. His breath steamed in the chilly air. He watched her bare feet pad up the icy metal steps, and followed her up to the roof.
The wind gusted cold, flattening her nightgown against her body, and Shadow became uncomfortably aware that Zorya Polunochnaya was wearing nothing at all underneath.
""You don't mind the cold?"" he said, as they reached the top of the fire escape, and the wind whipped his words away.
""Sorry?""
She bent her face close to his. Her breath was sweet.
""I said, doesn't the cold bother you?""
In reply, she held up a finger: Wait. She stepped, lightly, over the side of the building and onto the flat roof. Shadow stepped over a little more clumsily, and followed her across the roof, to the shadow of the water-tower. There was a wooden bench waiting for them there, and she sat down on it, and he sat down beside her.
The water-tower acted as a windbreak, for which Shadow was grateful. The lights of the city smudged the sky with yellow, swallowing half the stars he had been able to see from the open country. Still, he could see the Big Dipper and the North Star, and he found the three stars of Orion's belt, which allowed him to see Orion, which he always saw as a man running to kick a football-
""No,"" she said. ""The cold does not bother me. This time is my time: I could no more feel uncomfortable in the night than a fish could feel uncomfortable in the deep water.""
""You must like the night,"" said Shadow, wishing that he had said something wiser, more profound.
""My sisters are of their times. Zorya Utrennyaya is of the dawn. In the old country she would wake to open the gates, and let our father drive his-um, I forget the word, like a car but with horses?""
""Chariot?""
""His chariot. Our father would ride it out. And Zorya Vechernyaya, she would open the gates for him at dusk, when he returned to us.""
""And you?""
She paused. Her lips were full, but very pale. ""I never saw our father. I was asleep.""
""Is it a medical condition?""
She did not answer. The shrug, if she shrugged, was imperceptible. ""So. You wanted to know what I was looking at.""
""The Big Dipper.""
She raised an arm to point to it, and the wind flattened her nightgown against her body. Her nipples, every goose-bump on the areolae, were visible momentarily, dark against the white cotton. Shadow shivered.
""Odin's Wain, they call it. And the Great Bear. Where we come from, we believe that is a, a thing, a, not a god, but like a god, a bad thing, chained up in those stars. If it escapes, it will eat the whole of everything. And there are three sisters who must watch the sky, all the day, all the night. If he escapes, the thing in the stars, the world is over. Pf!, like that.""
""And people believe that?""
""They did. A long time ago.""
""And you were looking to see if you could see the monster in the stars?""
""Something like that. Yes.""
He smiled. If it were not for the cold, he decided, he would have thought he was dreaming. Everything felt so much like a dream.
""Can I ask how old you are? Your sisters seem so much older.""
She nodded her head. ""I am the youngest. Zorya Utrennyaya was born in the morning, and Zorya Vechernyaya was born in the evening, and I was born at midnight. I am the midnight sister: Zorya Polunochnaya. Are you married?""
""My wife is dead. She died last week in a car accident. It was her funeral yesterday.""
""I'm so sorry.""
""She came to see me last night."" It was not hard to say, in the darkness and the moonlight; it was not as unthinkable as it was by daylight.
""Did you ask her what she wanted?""
""No. Not really.""
""Perhaps you should. It is the wisest thing to ask the dead. Sometimes they will tell you. Zorya Vechernyaya tells me that you played checkers with Czernobog.""
""Yes. He won the right to knock in my skull with a sledge.""
""In the old days, they would take people up to the top of the mountains. To the high places. They would smash the back of their skulls with a rock. For Czernobog.""
Shadow glanced about. No, they were alone on the roof.
Zorya Polunochnaya laughed. ""Silly, he is not here. And you won a game also. He may not strike his blow until this is all over. He said he would not. And you will know. Like the cows he killed. They always know, first. Otherwise, what is the point?""
""I feel,"" Shadow told her, ""like I'm in a world with its own sense of logic. Its own rules. Like when you're in a dream, and you know there are rules you mustn't break, but you don't know what they are or what they mean. I have no idea what we're talking about, or what happened today, or pretty much anything since I got out of jail. I'm just going along with it, you know?""
""I know,"" she said. She held his hand, with a hand that was icy cold. ""You were given protection once, but you lost it already. You gave it away. You had the sun in your hand. And that is life itself. All I can give you is much weaker protection. The daughter, not the father. But all helps. Yes?"" Her white hair blew about her face in the chilly wind, and Shadow knew that it was time to go back inside.
""Do I have to fight you? Or play checkers?"" he asked.
""You do not even have to kiss me,"" she told him. ""Just take the moon.""
""How?""
""Take the moon.""
""I don't understand.""
""Watch,"" said Zorya Polunochnaya. She raised her left hand and held it in front of the moon, so that her forefinger and thumb seemed to be grasping it. Then, in one smooth movement, she plucked at it. For a moment, it looked like she had taken the moon from the sky, but then Shadow saw that the moon shone still, and Zorya Polunochnaya opened her hand to display a silver Liberty-head dollar resting between finger and thumb.
""That was beautifully done,"" said Shadow. ""I didn't see you palm it. And I don't know how you did that last bit.""
""I did not palm it,"" she said. ""I took it. And now I give it to you, to keep safe. Here. Don't give this one away.""
She placed it in his right hand and closed his fingers around it. The coin was cold in his hand. Zorya Polunochnaya leaned forward, and closed his eyes with her fingers, and kissed him, lightly, once upon each eyelid.
  
Shadow awoke on the sofa, fully dressed. A narrow shaft of sunlight streamed in through the window, making the dust motes dance.
He got out of bed, and walked over to the window. The room seemed much smaller in the daylight.
The thing that had been troubling him since last night came into focus as he looked out and down and across the street. There was no fire escape outside this window: no balcony, no rusting metal steps.
Still, held tight in the palm of his hand, bright and shiny as the day it had been minted, was a 1922 Liberty-head silver dollar.
""Oh. You're up,"" said Wednesday, putting his head around the door. ""That's good. You want coffee? We're going to rob a bank.""

Coming to America 1721 
The important thing to understand about American history, wrote Mr. Ibis, in his leather-bound journal, is that it is fictional, a charcoal-sketched simplicity for the children, or the easily bored. For the most part it is uninspected, unimagined, unthought, a representation of the thing, and not the thing itself. It is a fine fiction, he continued, pausing for a moment to dip his pen in the inkwell and collect his thoughts, that America was founded by pilgrims, seeking the freedom to believe as they wished, that they came to the Americas, spread and bred and filled the empty land.
In truth, the American colonies were as much a dumping ground as an escape, a forgetting place. In the days where you could be hanged in London from Tyburn's triple-crowned tree for the theft of twelve pennies, the Americas became a symbol of clemency, of a second chance. But the conditions of transportation were such that, for some, it was easier to take the leap from the leafless and dance on nothing until the dancing was done. Transportation it was called: for five years, for ten years, for life. That was the sentence.
You were sold to a captain, and would ride in his ship, crowded tight as a slaver's, to the colonies or to the West Indies; off the boat the captain would sell you on as an indentured servant to one who would take the cost of your skin out in your labor until the years of your indenture were done. But at least you were not waiting to hang in an English prison (for in those days prisons were places where you stayed until you were freed, transported, or hanged: you were not sentenced there for a term), and you were free to make the best of your new world. You were also free to bribe a sea captain to return you to England before the terms of your transportation were over and done. People did. And if the authorities caught you returning from transportation-if an old enemy, or an old friend with a score to settle, saw you and peached on you-then you were hanged without a blink.
I am reminded, he continued, after a short pause, during which he refilled the inkwell on his desk from the bottle of umber ink from the closet, and dipped his pen once more, of the life of Essie Tregowan, who came from a chilly little cliff-top village in Cornwall, in the Southwest of England, where her family had lived from time out of mind. Her father was a fisherman, and it was rumored that he was one of the wreckers-those who would hang their lamps high on the dangerous coast when the storm winds raged, luring ships onto the rocks, for the goods on shipboard. Essie's mother was in service as a cook at the squire's house, and, at the age of twelve, Essie began to work there, in the scullery. She was a thin little thing, with wide brown eyes and dark brown hair; and she was not a hard worker but was forever slipping off and away to listen to stories and tales, if there was anyone who would tell them: tales of the piskies and the spriggans, of the black dogs of the moors and the seal-women of the Channel. And, though the squire laughed at such things, the kitchen-folk always put out a china saucer of the creamiest milk at night, put it outside the kitchen door, for the piskies.
Several years passed, and Essie was no longer a thin little thing: now she curved and billowed like the swell of the green sea, and her brown eyes laughed, and her chestnut hair tossed and curled. Essie's eyes lighted on Bartholomew, the squire's eighteen-year-old son, home from Rugby, and she went at night to the standing stone on the edge of the woodland, and she put some bread that Bartholomew had been eating but had left unfinished on the stone, wrapped in a cut strand of her own hair. And on the very next day Bartholomew came and talked to her, and looked on her approvingly with his own eyes, the dangerous blue of a sky when a storm is coming, while she was cleaning out the grate in his bedroom.
He had such dangerous eyes, said Essie Tregowan.
Soon enough Bartholomew went up to Oxford, and, when Essie's condition became apparent, she was dismissed. But the babe was stillborn, and, as a favor to Essie's mother, who was a very fine cook, the squire's wife prevailed upon her husband to return the former maiden to her former position in the scullery.
Even so, Essie's love for Bartholomew had turned to hatred for his family, and within the year she took for her new beau a man from a neighboring village, with a bad reputation, who went by the name of Josiah Horner. And one night, when the family slept, Essie arose in the night and unbolted the side door, to let her lover in. He rifled the house while the family slept on.
Suspicion immediately fell upon someone in the house, for it was apparent that someone must have opened the door (which the squire's wife distinctly remembered having bolted herself) and someone must have known where the squire kept his silver plate, and the drawer in which he kept his coins and his promissory notes. Still, Essie, by resolutely denying everything, was convicted of nothing until Master Josiah Horner was caught, in a chandler's in Exeter, passing one of the squire's notes. The squire identified it as his, and Horner and Essie went to trial.
Horner was convicted at the local assizes, and was, as the slang of the time so cruelly and so casually had it, turned off, but the judge took pity on Essie, because of her age or her chestnut hair, and he sentenced her to seven years' transportation. She was to be transported on a ship called the Neptune, under the command of one Captain Clarke. So Essie went to the Carolinas; and on the way she conceived an alliance with the selfsame captain, and prevailed upon him to return her to England with him, as his wife, and to take her to his mother's house in London, where no man knew her. The journey back, when the human cargo had been exchanged for cotton and tobacco, was a peaceful time, and a happy one, for the captain and his new bride, who were as two lovebirds or courting butterflies, unable to cease from touching each other or giving each other little gifts and endearments.
When they reached London, Captain Clarke lodged Essie with his mother, who treated her in all ways as her son's new wife. Eight weeks later, the Neptune set sail again, and the pretty young bride with the chestnut hair waved her husband goodbye from dockside. Then she returned to her mother-in-law's house, where, the old woman being absent, Essie helped herself to a length of silk, several gold coins, and a silver pot in which the old woman kept her buttons, and pocketing these things Essie vanished into the stews of London.
Over the following two years Essie became an accomplished shop-lifter, her wide skirts capable of concealing a multitude of sins, consisting chiefly of stolen bolts of silk and lace, and she lived life to the full. Essie gave thanks for her escapes from her vicissitudes to all the creatures that she had been told of as a child, to the piskies (whose influence, she was certain, extended as far as London), and she would put a wooden bowl of milk on a window-ledge each night, although her friends laughed at her; but she had the last laugh, as her friends got the pox or the clap and Essie remained in the peak of health.
She was a year shy of her twentieth birthday when fate dealt her an ill-blow: she sat in the Crossed Forks Inn off Fleet Street, in Bell Yard, when she saw a young man enter and seat himself near the fireplace, fresh down from the University. ""Oho! A pigeon ripe for the plucking,"" thinks Essie to herself, and she sits next to him, and tells him what a fine young man he is, and with one hand she begins to stroke his knee, while her other hand, more carefully, goes in search of his pocket-watch. And then he looked her full in the face, and her heart leapt and sank as eyes the dangerous blue of the summer sky before a storm gazed back into hers, and Master Bartholomew said her name.
She was taken to Newgate and charged with returning from transportation. Found guilty, Essie shocked no one by pleading her belly, although the town matrons, who assessed such claims (which were usually spurious), were surprised when they were forced to agree that Essie was indeed with child; although who the father was, Essie declined to say.
Her sentence of death was once more commuted to transportation, this time for life.
She rode out this time on the Sea-Maiden. There were two hundred transportees on that ship, packed into the hold like so many fat hogs on their way to market. Fluxes and fevers ran rampant; there was scarcely room to sit, let alone to lie down; a woman died in childbirth in the back of the hold, and, the people being pushed in too tightly to pass her body forward, she and the infant were forced out of a small porthole in the back, directly into the choppy gray sea. Essie was eight months gone, and it was a wonder she kept the baby, but keep it she did.
In her life ever after she would have nightmares of her time in that hold, and she would wake up screaming with the taste and stench of the place in her throat.
The Sea-Maiden landed at Norfolk in Virginia, and Essie's indenture was bought by a ""small planter,"" a tobacco farmer named John Richardson, for his wife had died of the childbirth fever a week after giving birth to his daughter, and he had need of a wet-nurse and a maid of all work upon his smallholding.
So Essie's baby boy, whom she called Anthony, after, she said, her late husband his father (knowing there was none there to contradict her, and perhaps she had known an Anthony once), sucked at Essie's breast alongside of Phyllida Richardson, and her employer's child always got first suck, so she grew into a healthy child, tall and strong, while Essie's son grew weak and rickety on what was left.
And along with the milk, the children as they grew drank Essie's tales: of the knockers and the blue-caps who live down the mines; of the Bucca, the tricksiest spirit of the land, much more dangerous than the red-headed, snub-nosed piskies, for whom the first fish of the catch was always left upon the shingle, and for whom a fresh-baked loaf of bread was left in the field, at reaping time, to ensure a fine harvest; she told them of the apple-tree men-old apple trees who talked when they had a mind, and who needed to be placated with the first cider of the crop, which was poured onto their roots as the year turned, if they were to give you a fine crop for the next year. She told them, in her mellifluous Cornish drawl, which trees they should be wary of, in the old rhyme:

Elm, he do brood
And Oak, he do hate,
But the willow-man goes walking,
If you stays out late.
 
She told them all these things, and they believed, because she believed.
The farm prospered, and Essie Tregowan placed a china saucer of milk outside the back door, each night, for the piskies. And after eight months John Richardson came a-knocking quietly on Essie's bedroom door, and asked her for favors of the kind a woman shows a man, and Essie told him how shocked and hurt she was, a poor widow-woman, and an indentured servant no better than a slave, to be asked to prostitute herself for a man whom she had had so much respect for-and an indentured servant could not marry, so how he could even think to torment an indentured transportee girl so she could not bring herself to think-and her nut-brown eyes filled with tears, such that Richardson found himself apologizing to her, and the upshot of it was that John Richardson wound up, in that corridor, of that hot summer's night, going down on one knee to Essie Tregowan and proposing an end to her indenture and offering his hand in marriage. Now, although she accepted him, she would not sleep a night with him until it was legal, whereupon she moved from the little room in the attic to the master bedroom in the front of the house; and if some of Farmer Richardson's friends and their wives cut him when next they saw him in town, many more of them were of the opinion that the new Mistress Richardson was a damn fine-looking woman, and that Johnnie Richardson had done quite well for himself.
Within a year, she was delivered of another child, another boy, but as blond as his father and his half-sister, and they named him John, after his father.
The three children went to the local church to hear the traveling preacher on Sundays, and they went to the little school to learn their letters and their numbers with the children of the other small farmers; while Essie also made sure they knew the mysteries of the piskies, which were the most important mysteries there were: red-headed men, with eyes and clothes as green as a river, with turned-up noses, funny, squinting men who would, if they got a mind to, turn you and twist you and lead you out of your way, unless you had salt in your pocket, or a little bread. When the children went off to school, they each of them carried a little salt in one pocket, a little bread in the other, the old symbols of life and the earth, to make sure they came safely home once more, and they always did.
The children grew in the lush Virginia hills, grew tall and strong (although Anthony, her first son, was always weaker, paler, more prone to disease and bad airs) and the Richardsons were happy; and Essie loved her husband as best she could. They had been married a decade when John Richardson developed a toothache so bad it made him fall from his horse. They took him to the nearest town, where his tooth was pulled; but it was too late, and the blood-poisoning carried him off, black-faced and groaning, and they buried him beneath his favorite willow tree.
The widow Richardson was left the farm to manage until Richardson's two children were of age: she managed the indentured servants and the slaves, and brought in the tobacco crop, year in, year out; she poured cider on the roots of the apple trees on New Year's Eve, and placed a loaf of new-baked bread in the fields at harvest-time, and she always left a saucer of milk at the back door. The farm flourished, and the widow Richardson gained a reputation as a hard bargainer, but one whose crop was always good, and who never sold shoddy for better merchadise.
So all went well for another ten years; but after that was a bad year, for Anthony, her son, slew Johnnie, his half-brother, in a furious quarrel over the future of the farm and the disposition of Phyllida's hand; and some said he had not meant to kill his brother, and that it was a foolish blow that struck too deep, and some said otherwise. Anthony fled, leaving Essie to bury her youngest son beside his father. Now, some said Anthony fled to Boston, and some said he went south, to Florida, and his mother was of the opinion that he had taken ship to England, to enlist in George's army and fight the rebel Scots. But with both sons gone the farm was an empty place, and a sad one, and Phyllida pined and plained as if her heart had been broken, while nothing that her stepmother could say or do would put a smile back on her lips again.
But heartbroken or not, they needed a man about the farm, and so Phyllida married Harry Soames, a ship's carpenter by profession, who had tired of the sea and who dreamed of a life on land on a farm like the Lincolnshire farm upon which he had grown up. And although the Richardsons' farm was little enough like that, Harry Soames found correspondences enough to make him happy. Five children were born to Phyllida and Harry, three of whom lived.
The widow Richardson missed her sons, and she missed her husband, although he was now little more than a memory of a fair man who treated her kindly. Phyllida's children would come to Essie for tales, and she would tell them of the Black Dog of the Moors, and of Raw-Head and Bloody-Bones, or the Apple Tree Man, but they were not interested; they only wanted tales of Jack-Jack up the Beanstalk, or Jack Giant-killer, or Jack and his Cat and the King. She loved those children as if they were her own flesh and blood, although sometimes she would call them by the names of those long dead.
It was May, and she took her chair out into the kitchen garden, to pick peas and to shuck them in the sunlight, for even in the lush heat of Virginia the cold had entered her bones as the frost had entered her hair, and a little warmth was a fine thing.
As the widow Richardson shucked the peas with her old hands, she got to thinking about how fine it would be to walk once more on the moors and the salty cliffs of her native Cornwall, and she thought of sitting on the shingle as a little girl, waiting for her father's boat to return from the gray seas. Her hands, blue-knuckled and clumsy, opened the pea-pods, forced the full peas into an earthenware bowl, and dropped the empty pea-pods onto her aproned lap. And then she found herself remembering, as she had not remembered for a long time, a life well lost: how she had twitched purses and filched silks with her clever fingers; and now she remembers the warden of Newgate telling her that it would be a good twelve weeks before her case would be heard, and that she could escape the gallows if she could plead her belly, and what a pretty thing she was-and how she had turned to the wall and bravely lifted her skirts, hating herself and hating him, but knowing he was right; and the feel of the life, quickening inside her, that meant that she could cheat death for a little longer...
""Essie Tregowan?"" said the stranger.
The widow Richardson looked up, shading her eyes in the May sunshine. ""Do I know you?"" she asked. She had not heard him approach.
The man was dressed all in green: dusty green trews, green jacket, and a dark green coat. His hair was a carroty red, and he grinned at her all lopsided. There was something about the man that made her happy to look at him, and something else that whispered of danger. ""You might say that you know me,"" he said.
He squinted down at her, and she squinted right back up at him, searching his moon-face for a clue to his identity. He looked as young as one of her own grandchildren, yet he had called her by her old name, and there was a burr in his voice she knew from her childhood, from the rocks and the moors of her home.
""You're a Cornishman?"" she asked.
""That I am, a Cousin Jack,"" said the red-haired man. ""Or rather, that I was, but now I'm here in this new world, where nobody puts out ale or milk for an honest fellow, or a loaf of bread come harvest time.""
The old woman steadied the bowl of peas upon her lap. ""If you're who I think you are,"" she said, ""then I've no quarrel with you."" In the house, she could hear Phyllida grumbling to the housekeeper.
""Nor I with you,"" said the red-haired fellow, a little sadly, ""although it was you that brought me here, you and a few like you, into this land with no time for magic and no place for piskies and such folk.""
""You've done me many a good turn,"" she said.
""Good and ill,"" said the squinting stranger. ""We're like the wind. We blows both ways.""
Essie nodded.
""Will you take my hand, Essie Tregowan?"" And he reached out a hand to her. Freckled it was, and although Essie's eyesight was going she could see each orange hair on the back of his hand, glowing golden in the afternoon sunlight. She bit her lip. Then, hesitantly, she placed her blue-knotted hand in his.
She was still warm when they found her, although the life had fled her body and only half the peas were shelled.

People are in the dark, they don't know what to do
I had a little lantern, oh but it got blown out too.
I'm reaching out my hand. I hope you are too.
I just want to be in the dark with you.
-GREG BROWN, ""IN THE DARK WITH YOU"" 
They changed cars at five in the morning, in Minneapolis, in the airport's long-term parking lot. They drove to the top floor, where the parking building was open to the sky.
Shadow took the orange uniform and the handcuffs and leg hobbles, put them in the brown paper bag that had briefly held his possessions, folded the whole thing up and dropped it into a parking lot garbage can. They had been waiting for ten minutes when a barrel-chested young man came out of an airport door and walked over to them. He was eating a packet of Burger King french fries. Shadow recognized him immediately: he had sat in the back of the car when they had left the House on the Rock, and hummed so deeply the car had vibrated. He now sported a white-streaked winter beard he had not had when they had met at the House on the Rock. It made him look older.
The man wiped the grease from his hands onto his sweater, extended one huge hand to Shadow. ""I heard of the all-father's death,"" he said. ""They will pay, and they will pay dearly.""
""Wednesday was your father?"" asked Shadow.
""He was the all-father,"" said the man. His deep voice caught in his throat. ""You tell them, tell them all, that when we are needed my people will be there.""
Czernobog picked at a flake of tobacco between his teeth and spat it out onto the frozen slush. ""And how many of you is that? Ten? Twenty?""
The barrel-chested man's beard bristled. ""And aren't ten of us worth a hundred of them? Who would stand against even one of my folk, in a battle? But there are more of us than that, at the edges of the cities. There are a few in the mountains. Some in the Catskills, a few living in the carny towns in Florida. They keep their axes sharp. They will come if I call them.""
""You do that, Elvis,"" said Mr. Nancy. Shadow thought he said Elvis, anyway, but he couldn't be sure. Nancy had exchanged the deputy's uniform for a thick brown cardigan, corduroy trousers, and brown loafers. ""You call them. It's what the old bastard would have wanted.""
""They betrayed him. They killed him. I laughed at Wednesday, but I was wrong. None of us are safe any longer,"" said the man who might have been named Elvis. ""But you can rely on us."" He gently patted Shadow on the back and almost sent him sprawling. It was like being gently patted on the back by a wrecking ball.
Czernobog had been looking around the parking lot. Now he said, ""You will pardon me asking, but our new vehicle is which?""
The barrel-chested man pointed. ""There she is,"" he said.
Czernobog snorted. ""That?""
It was a 1970 VW bus. There was a rainbow decal in the rear window.
""It's a fine vehicle. And it's the last thing that they'll be expecting you to be driving. The last thing they'll be looking for.""
Czernobog walked around the vehicle. Then he started to cough, a lung-rumbling, old-man, five-in-the-morning, smoker's cough. He hawked, and spat, and put his hand to his chest, massaging away the pain. ""Yes. The last car they will suspect. So what happens when the police pull us over, looking for the hippies, and the dope? Eh? We are not here to ride the magic bus. We are to blend in.""
The bearded man unlocked the door of the bus. ""So they take a look at you, they see you aren't hippies, they wave you goodbye. It's the perfect disguise. And it's all I could find at no notice.""
Czernobog seemed to be ready to argue it further, but Mr. Nancy intervened smoothly. ""Elvis, you come through for us. We are very grateful. Now, that car needs to get back to Chicago.""
""We'll leave it in Bloomington,"" said the bearded man. ""The wolves will take care of it. Don't give it another thought."" He turned back to Shadow. ""Again, you have my sympathy and I share your pain. Good luck. And if the vigil falls to you, my admiration, and my sympathy."" He squeezed Shadow's hand in sympathy and in friendship with his own catcher's-mitt fist. It hurt. ""You tell his corpse when you see it. Tell him that Alviss son of Vindalf will keep the faith.""
The VW bus smelled of patchouli, of old incense and rolling tobacco. There was a faded pink carpet glued to the floor and to the walls.
""Who was that?"" asked Shadow, as he drove them down the ramp, grinding the gears.
""Just like he said, Alviss son of Vindalf. He's the king of the dwarfs. The biggest, mightiest, greatest of all the dwarf folk.""
""But he's not a dwarf,"" pointed out Shadow. ""He's what, five eight? Five nine?""
""Which makes him a giant among dwarfs,"" said Czernobog from behind him. ""Tallest dwarf in America.""
""What was that about the vigil?"" asked Shadow.
The two old men said nothing. Shadow glanced to his right. Mr. Nancy was staring out of the window.
""Well? He was talking about a vigil. You heard him.""
Czernobog spoke up from the back seat. ""You will not have to do it,"" he said.
""Do what?""
""The vigil. He talks too much. All the dwarfs talk and talk and talk. And sing. All the time, sing, sing, sing. Is nothing to think of. Better you put it out of your mind.""
  
They drove south, keeping off the freeways (""We must assume,"" said Mr. Nancy, ""that they are in enemy hands. Or that they are perhaps enemy hands in their own right""). Driving south was like driving forward in time. The snows erased, slowly, and were completely gone by the following morning when the bus reached Kentucky. Winter was already over in Kentucky, and spring was on its way. Shadow began to wonder if there were some kind of equation to explain it-perhaps every fifty miles he drove south he was driving a day into the future.
He would have mentioned his idea to his passengers, but Mr. Nancy was asleep in the passenger seat in the front, while Czernobog snored unceasingly in the back.
Time seemed a flexible construct at that moment, an illusion he was imagining as he drove. He found himself becoming painfully aware of birds and animals: he saw the crows on the side of the road, or in the bus's path, picking at roadkill; flights of birds wheeled across the skies in patterns that almost made sense; cats stared at them from front lawns and fence-posts.
Czernobog snorted and woke, sitting up slowly. ""I dreamed a strange dream,"" he said. ""I dreamed that I am truly Bielebog. That forever the world imagines that there are two of us, the light god and the dark, but that now we are both old, I find it was only me all the time, giving them gifts, taking my gifts away."" He broke the filter from a Lucky Strike, put it between his lips and lit it with his lighter.
Shadow wound down his window.
""Aren't you worried about lung cancer?"" he said.
""I am cancer,"" said Czernobog. ""I do not frighten myself."" He chuckled, and then the chuckle became a wheeze and the wheeze turned into a cough.
Nancy spoke. ""Folk like us don't get cancer. We don't get arteriosclerosis or Parkinson's disease or syphilis. We're kind of hard to kill.""
""They killed Wednesday,"" said Shadow.
He pulled over for gas, and then parked next door at a restaurant, for an early breakfast. As they entered, the payphone in the entrance began to jangle. They walked past it without answering it, and it stopped ringing.
They gave their orders to an elderly woman with a worried smile, who had been sitting reading a paperback copy of What My Heart Meant by Jenny Kerton. The telephone began to ring once more. The woman sighed, then walked back and over to the phone, picked it up, said, ""Yes."" Then she looked back at the room, said, ""Yep. Looks like they are. You just hold the line now,"" and walked over to Mr. Nancy.
""It's for you,"" she said.
""Okay,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""Now, ma'am, you make sure those fries are real crisp now. Think burnt."" He walked over to the payphone.
""This is he,"" he said.
""And what makes you think I'm dumb enough to trust you?"" he said.
""I can find it,"" he said. ""I know where it is.""
""Yes,"" he said. ""We want it. You know we want it. And I know you want to get rid of it. So don't give me any shit.""
He put down the telephone, came back to the table.
""Who was it?"" asked Shadow.
""Didn't say.""
""What did they want?""
""They were offerin' us a truce, while they hand over the body.""
""They lie,"" said Czernobog. ""They want to lure us in, and then they will kill us. What they did to Wednesday. Is what I always used to do,"" he added, with gloomy pride. ""Promise them anything, but do what you will.""
""It's on neutral territory,"" said Nancy. ""Truly neutral.""
Czernobog chuckled. It sounded like a metal ball rattling in a dry skull. ""I used to say that also. Come to a neutral place, I would say, and then in the night we would rise up and kill them all. Those were the good days.""
Mr. Nancy shrugged. He crunched down on his dark brown french fries, grinned his approval. ""Mm-mm. These are fine fries,"" he said.
""We can't trust those people,"" said Shadow.
""Listen, I'm older than you and I'm smarter than you and I'm better lookin' than you,"" said Mr. Nancy, thumping the bottom of the ketchup bottle, blobbing ketchup over his burnt fries. ""I can get more pussy in an afternoon than you'll get in a year. I can dance like an angel, fight like a cornered bear, plan better than a fox, sing like a nightingale...""
""And your point here is...?""
Nancy's brown eyes gazed into Shadow's. ""And they need to get rid of the body as much as we need to take it.""
Czernobog said, ""There is no such neutral place.""
""There's one,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""It's the center.""
Czernobog shook his head abruptly. ""No. They would not meet us there. They can do nothing to us, there. It is a bad place for all of us.""
""That's just why they've proposed to make the handover at the center.""
Czernobog seemed to think about this for a while. And then he said, ""Perhaps.""
""When we get back on the road,"" said Shadow, ""you can drive. I need to sleep.""
  
Determining the exact center of anything can be problematic at best. With living things-people, for example, or continents-the problem becomes one of intangibles: What is the center of a man? What is the center of a dream? And in the case of the continental United States, should one count Alaska when one attempts to find the center? Or Hawaii?
As the twentieth century began, they made a huge model of the USA, the lower forty-eight states, out of cardboard, and to find the center they balanced it on a pin, until they found the single place it balanced.
Near as anyone could figure it out, the exact center of the continental United States was several miles from Lebanon, in Smith County, Kansas, on Johnny Grib's hog farm. By the 1930s, the people of Lebanon were all ready to put a monument up in the middle of the hog farm, but Johnny Grib said that he didn't want millions of tourists coming in and tramping all over and upsetting the hogs, and the locals figured he had a point, so they put the monument to the geographical center of the United States two miles north of the town. They built a park, and a stone monument to put in the park, and put a brass plaque to go on the monument to tell you that you were indeed looking at the exact geographic center of the United States of America. They blacktopped the road from the town to the little park, and, certain of the influx of tourists just waiting to come to Lebanon, they even built a motel by the monument. They brought in a little mobile chapel as well, and took off the wheels. Then they waited for the tourists and the holidaymakers to come: all the people who wanted to tell the world they'd been at the center of America, and marveled, and prayed.
The tourists did not come. Nobody came.
It's a sad little park, now, with a mobile chapel in it a little bigger than an ice-fishing hut that wouldn't fit a small funeral party, and a motel whose windows look like dead eyes.
""Which is why,"" concluded Mr. Nancy, as they drove into Humansville, Missouri (pop. 1,084), ""the exact center of America is a tiny run-down park, an empty church, a pile of stones, and a derelict motel.""
""Hog farm,"" said Czernobog. ""You just said that the real center of America was a hog farm.""
""This isn't about what is,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""It's about what people think is. It's all imaginary anyway. That's why it's important. People only fight over imaginary things.""
""My kind of people?"" asked Shadow. ""Or your kind of people?""
Nancy said nothing. Czernobog made a noise that might have been a chuckle, might have been a snort.
Shadow tried to get comfortable in the back of the bus. He had slept a little, but only a little. He had a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach. Worse than the feeling he had had in prison, worse than the feeling he had had back when Laura had come to him and told him about the robbery. This was bad. The back of his neck prickled, he felt sick and, several times, in waves, he felt scared.
Mr. Nancy pulled over in Humansville, parked outside a supermarket. Mr. Nancy went inside, and Shadow followed him in. Czernobog waited in the parking lot, stretching his legs, smoking his cigarette.
There was a young fair-haired man, little more than a boy, restocking the breakfast cereal shelves.
""Hey,"" said Mr. Nancy.
""Hey,"" said the young man. ""It's true, isn't it? They killed him?""
""Yes,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""They killed him.""
The young man banged several boxes of Cap'n Crunch down on the shelf. ""They think they can crush us like cockroaches,"" he said. He had an eruption of acne across one cheek and over his forehead. He had a silver bracelet high on one forearm. ""We don't crush that easy, do we?""
""No,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""We don't.""
""I'll be there, sir,"" said the young man, his pale blue eyes blazing.
""I know you will, Gwydion,"" said Mr. Nancy.
Mr. Nancy bought several large bottles of RC Cola, a six-pack of toilet paper, a pack of evil-looking black cigarillos, a bunch of bananas and a pack of Doublemint chewing gum. ""He's a good boy. Came over in the seventh century. Welsh.""
The bus meandered first to the west and then to the north. Spring faded back into the dead end of winter. Kansas was the cheerless gray of lonesome clouds, empty windows and lost hearts. Shadow had become adept at hunting for radio stations, negotiating between Mr. Nancy, who liked talk radio and dance music, and Czernobog, who favored classical music, the gloomier the better, leavened with the more extreme evangelical religious stations. For himself, Shadow liked oldies stations.
Toward the end of the afternoon they stopped, at Czernobog's request, on the outskirts of Cherryvale, Kansas (pop. 2,464). Czernobog led them to a meadow outside the town. There were still traces of snow in the shadows of the trees, and the grass was the color of dirt.
""Wait here,"" said Czernobog.
He walked, alone, to the center of the meadow. He stood there, in the winds of the end of February, for some time. At first he hung his head, then he began gesticulating.
""He looks like he's talking to someone,"" said Shadow.
""Ghosts,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""They worshiped him here, over a hundred years ago. They made blood-sacrifice to him, libations spilled with the hammer. After a time, the townsfolk figured out why so many of the strangers who passed through the town didn't ever come back. This was where they hid some of the bodies.""
Czernobog came back from the middle of the field. His moustache seemed darker now, and there were streaks of black in his gray hair. He smiled, showing his iron tooth. ""I feel good, now. Ahh. Some things linger, and blood lingers longest.""
They walked back across the meadow to where they had parked the VW bus. Czernobog lit a cigarette, but did not cough. ""They did it with the hammer,"" he said. ""Grimnir, he would talk of the gallows and the spear, but for me, it is one thing..."" He reached out a nicotine-colored finger and tapped it, hard, in the center of Shadow's forehead.
""Please don't do that,"" said Shadow, politely.
""Please don't do that,"" mimicked Czernobog. ""One day I will take my hammer and do much worse than that to you, my friend, remember?""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""But if you tap my head again, I'll break your hand.""
Czernobog snorted. Then he said, ""They should be grateful, the people here. There was such power raised. Even thirty years after they forced my people into hiding, this land, this very land, gave us the greatest movie star of all time. She was the greatest there ever was.""
""Judy Garland?"" asked Shadow.
Czernobog shook his head curtly.
""He's talking about Louise Brooks,"" said Mr. Nancy.
Shadow decided not to ask who Louise Brooks was. Instead he said, ""So, look, when Wednesday went to talk to them, he did it under a truce.""
""Yes.""
""And now we're going to get Wednesday's body from them, as a truce.""
""Yes.""
""And we know that they want me dead or out of the way.""
""They want all of us dead,"" said Nancy.
""So what I don't get is, why do we think they'll play fair this time, when they didn't for Wednesday?""
""That,"" said Czernobog, overenunciating each word, as he would for a deaf foreign idiot child, ""is why we are meeting at the center. Is..."" He frowned. ""What is the word for it? The opposite of sacred?""
""Profane,"" said Shadow, without thinking.
""No,"" said Czernobog. ""I mean, when a place is less sacred than any other place. Of negative sacredness. Places where they can build no temples. Places where people will not come, and will leave as soon as they can. Places where gods only walk if they are forced to.""
""I don't know,"" said Shadow. ""I don't think there is a word for it.""
""All of America has it, a little,"" said Czernobog. ""That is why we are not welcome here. But the center,"" said Czernobog. ""The center is worst. Is like a minefield. We all tread too carefully there to dare break the truce.""
""I told you all this already,"" said Mr. Nancy.
""Whatever,"" said Shadow.
They had reached the bus. Czernobog patted Shadow's upper arm. ""You don't worry,"" he said, with gloomy reassurance. ""Nobody else is going to kill you. Nobody but me.""
  
Shadow found the center of America at evening that same day, before it was fully dark. It was on a slight hill to the northwest of Lebanon. He drove around the little hillside park, past the tiny mobile chapel and the stone monument, and when Shadow saw the one-story 1950s motel at the edge of the park his heart sank. There was a huge black car parked in front of it-a Humvee, which looked like a jeep reflected in a fun-house mirror, as squat and pointless and ugly as an armored car. There were no lights on in the building
They parked beside the motel, and as they did so, a man in a chauffeur's uniform and cap walked out of the motel and was illuminated by the headlights of the bus. He touched his cap to them, politely, got into the Humvee, and drove off.
""Big car, tiny dick,"" said Mr. Nancy.
""Do you think they'll even have beds here?"" asked Shadow. ""It's been days since I slept in a bed. This place looks like it's just waiting to be demolished.""
""It's owned by hunters from Texas,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""Come up here once a year. Damned if I know what they're huntin'. It stops the place being condemned and destroyed.""
They climbed out of the bus. Waiting for them in front of the motel was a woman Shadow did not recognize. She was perfectly made-up, perfectly coiffed. She reminded him of every newscaster he'd ever seen on morning television sitting in a studio that didn't really resemble a living room, smiling at the good morning crowd.
""Lovely to see you,"" she said. ""Now, you must be Czernobog. I've heard a lot about you. And you're Anansi, always up to mischief, eh? You jolly old man. And you, you must be Shadow. You've certainly led us a merry chase, haven't you?"" A hand took his, pressed it firmly, looked him straight in the eye. ""I'm Media. Good to meet you. I hope we can get this evening's business done as pleasantly as possible.""
The main doors opened. ""Somehow, Toto,"" said the fat kid Shadow had last seen sitting in a limo, ""I don't believe we're in Kansas any more.""
""We're in Kansas,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""I think we must have driven through most of it today. Damn but this country is flat.""
""This place has no lights, no power, and no hot water,"" said the fat kid. ""And, no offense, you people really need the hot water. You just smell like you've been in that bus for a week.""
""I don't think there's any need to go there,"" said the woman, smoothly. ""We're all friends here. Come on in. We'll show you to your rooms. We took the first four rooms. Your late friend is in the fifth. All the ones beyond room five are empty-you can take your pick. I'm afraid it's not the Four Seasons, but then, what is?""
She opened the door to the motel lobby for them. It smelled of mildew, of damp and dust and of decay.
There was a man sitting in the lobby, in the near darkness. ""You people hungry?"" he asked.
""I can always eat,"" said Mr. Nancy.
""Driver's gone out for a sack of hamburgers,"" said the man. ""He'll be back soon."" He looked up. It was too dark to see faces, but he said, ""Big guy. You're Shadow, huh? The asshole who killed Woody and Stone?""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""That was someone else. And I know who you are."" He did. He had been inside the man's head. ""You're Town. Have you slept with Wood's widow yet?""
Mr. Town fell off his chair. In a movie, it would have been funny; in real life it was simply clumsy. He stood up quickly, came toward Shadow. Shadow looked down at him, and said, ""Don't start anything you're not prepared to finish.""
Mr. Nancy rested his hand on Shadow's upper arm. ""Truce, remember?"" he said. ""We're at the center.""
Mr. Town turned away, leaned over to the counter and picked up three keys. ""You're down at the end of the hall,"" he said. ""Here.""
He handed the keys to Mr. Nancy and walked away, into the shadows of the corridor. They heard a motel room door open, and they heard it slam.
Mr. Nancy passed a key to Shadow, another to Czernobog. ""Is there a flashlight on the bus?"" asked Shadow.
""No,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""But it's just dark. You mustn't be afraid of the dark.""
""I'm not,"" said Shadow. ""I'm afraid of the people in the dark.""
""Dark is good,"" said Czernobog. He seemed to have no difficulty seeing where he was going, leading them down the darkened corridor, putting the keys into the locks without fumbling. ""I will be in room ten,"" he told them. And then he said, ""Media. I think I have heard of her. Isn't she the one who killed her children?""
""Different woman,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""Same deal.""
Mr. Nancy was in room eight, and Shadow opposite the two of them, in room nine. The room smelled damp, and dusty, and deserted. There was a bed-frame in there, with a mattress on it, but no sheets. A little light entered the room from the gloaming outside the window. Shadow sat down on the mattress, pulled off his shoes, and stretched out at full length. He had driven too much in the last few days.
Perhaps he slept.
  
He was walking.
A cold wind tugged at his clothes. The tiny snowflakes were little more than a crystalline dust which gusted and flurried in the wind.
There were trees, bare of leaves in the winter. There were high hills on each side of him. It was late on a winter's afternoon: the sky and the snow had attained the same deep shade of purple. Somewhere ahead of him-in this light, distances were impossible to judge-the flames of a bonfire flickered, yellow and orange.
A gray wolf padded through the snow before him.
Shadow stopped. The wolf stopped also, and turned, and waited. One of its eyes glinted yellowish-green. Shadow shrugged and walked toward the flames and the wolf ambled ahead of him.
The bonfire burned in the middle of a grove of trees. There must have been a hundred trees, planted in two rows. There were shapes hanging from the trees. At the end of the rows was a building that looked a little like an overturned boat. It was carved of wood, and it crawled with wooden creatures and wooden faces-dragons, gryphons, trolls and boars-all of them dancing in the flickering light of the fire.
The bonfire was so high, and burning so hard, that Shadow could barely approach it. The wolf seemed unfazed, and it padded around the crackling fire.
He waited for it to return, but in place of the wolf a man walked back around the fire. He was leaning on a tall stick.
""You are in Uppsala, in Sweden,"" said the man, in a familiar, gravelly voice. ""About a thousand years ago.""
""Wednesday?"" said Shadow.
The man who might have been Wednesday continued to talk, as if Shadow was not there. ""First every year, then, later, when the rot set in, and they became lax, every nine years, they would sacrifice here. A sacrifice of nines. Each day, for nine days, they would hang nine animals from trees in the grove. One of those animals was always a man.""
He strode away from the firelight, toward the trees, and Shadow followed him. As he approached the trees the shapes that hung from them resolved: legs and eyes and tongues and heads. Shadow shook his head: there was something about seeing a bull hanging by its neck from a tree that was darkly sad, and at the same time surreal enough almost to be funny. Shadow passed a hanging stag, a wolfhound, a brown bear, and a chestnut horse with a white mane, little bigger than a pony. The dog was still alive: every few seconds it would kick spasmodically, and it was making a strained whimpering noise, as it dangled from the rope.
The man he was following took his long stick, which Shadow realized now, as it moved, was actually a spear, and he slashed at the dog's stomach with it, in one knife-like cut downward. Steaming entrails tumbled onto the snow. ""I dedicate this death to Odin,"" said the man, formally.
""It is only a gesture,"" he said, turning back to Shadow. ""But gestures mean everything. The death of one dog symbolizes the death of all dogs. Nine men they gave to me, but they stood for all the men, all the blood, all the power. It just wasn't enough. One day, the blood stopped flowing. Belief without blood only takes us so far. The blood must flow.""
""I saw you die,"" said Shadow.
""In the god business,"" said the figure-and now Shadow was certain it was Wednesday, nobody else had that rasp, that deep cynical joy in words, ""it's not the death that matters. It's the opportunity for resurrection. And when the blood flows..."" He gestured at the animals, at the people, hanging from the trees.
Shadow could not decide whether the dead humans they walked past were more or less horrifying than the animals: at least the humans had known the fate they were going to. There was a deep, boozy smell about the men that suggested that they had been allowed to anaesthetize themselves on their way to the gallows, while the animals would simply have been lynched, hauled up alive and terrified. The faces of the men looked so young: none of them was older than twenty.
""Who am I?"" asked Shadow.
""You are a diversion,"" said the man. ""You were an opportunity. You gave the whole affair an air of credibility I would have been hard put to deliver solo. Although both of us are committed enough to the affair to die for it. Eh?""
""Who are you?"" asked Shadow.
""The hardest part is simply surviving,"" said the man. The bonfire-and Shadow realized with a strange horror that it truly was a bone-fire: ribcages and fire-eyed skulls stared and stuck and jutted from the flames, sputtering trace-element colors into the night, greens and yellows and blues-was flaring and crackling and burning hotly. ""Three days on the tree, three days in the underworld, three days to find my way back.""
The flames sputtered and flared too brightly for Shadow to look at directly. He looked down into the darkness beneath the trees.
There was no fire, no snow. There were no trees, no hanged bodies, no bloody spear.
  
A knock on the door-and now there was moonlight coming in the window. Shadow sat up with a start. ""Dinner's served,"" said Media's voice.
Shadow put his shoes back on, walked over to the door, went out into the corridor. Someone had found some candles, and a dim yellow light illuminated the reception hall. The driver of the Humvee came in through the swing doors holding a cardboard tray and a paper sack. He wore a long black coat and a peaked chauffeur's cap.
""Sorry about the delay,"" he said, hoarsely. ""I got everybody the same: a couple of burgers, large fries, large Coke, and apple pie. I'll eat mine out in the car."" He put the food down, then walked back outside. The smell of fast food filled the lobby. Shadow took the paper bag and passed out the food, the napkins, the packets of ketchup.
They ate in silence while the candles flickered and the burning wax hissed.
Shadow noticed that Town was glaring at him. He turned his chair a little, so his back was to the wall. Media ate her burger with a napkin poised by her lips to remove crumbs.
""Oh. Great. These burgers are nearly cold,"" said the fat kid. He was still wearing his shades, which Shadow thought pointless and foolish, given the darkness of the room.
""Sorry about that. The guy had to drive a way to find them,"" said Town. ""The nearest McDonald's is in Nebraska.""
They finished their lukewarm hamburgers and cold fries. The fat kid bit into his single-person apple pie, and the filling spurted down his chin. Unexpectedly, the filling was still hot. ""Ow,"" he said. He wiped at it with his hand, licking his fingers to get them clean. ""That stuff burns!"" he said. ""Those pies are a class action suit waiting to fucking happen.""
Shadow realized he wanted to hit the kid. He'd wanted to hit him since the kid had his goons hurt him in the limo, after Laura's funeral. He knew it was not a wise thing to be thinking, not here, not now. ""Can't we just take Wednesday's body and get out of here?"" he asked.
""Midnight,"" said Mr. Nancy and the fat kid, at the same time.
""These things must be done according to the rules,"" said Czernobog. ""All things have rules.""
""Yeah,"" said Shadow. ""But nobody tells me what they are. You keep talking about the goddamn rules, I don't even know what game you people are playing.""
""It's like breaking the street date,"" said Media, brightly. ""You know. When things are allowed to be on sale.""
Town said, ""I think the whole thing's a crock of shit. But if their rules make them happy, then my agency is happy and everybody's happy."" He slurped his Coke. ""Roll on midnight. You take the body, you go away. We're all lovey-fucking-dovey and we wave you goodbye. And then we can get on with hunting you down like the rats you are.""
""Hey,"" said the fat kid to Shadow. ""Reminds me. I told you to tell your boss he was history. Did you ever tell him?""
""I told him,"" said Shadow. ""And you know what he said to me? He said to tell the little snot, if ever I saw him again, to remember that today's future is tomorrow's yesterday."" Wednesday had never said any such thing, but Shadow delivered it as Wednesday would have done. These people seemed to like clichés. The black sunglasses reflected the flickering candle-flames back at him, like eyes.
The fat kid said, ""This place is such a fucking dump. No power. Out of wireless range. I mean, when you got to be wired, you're already back in the Stone Age."" He sucked the last of his Coke through the straw, dropped the cup on the table and walked away down the corridor.
Shadow reached over and placed the fat kid's garbage back into the paper sack. ""I'm going to see the center of America,"" he announced. He got up and walked outside, into the night. Mr. Nancy followed him. They strolled together, across the little park, saying nothing until they reached the stone monument. The wind gusted at them, fitfully, first from one direction, then from another. ""So,"" he said. ""Now what?""
The half-moon hung pale in the dark sky.
""Now,"" said Nancy, ""you should go back to your room. Lock the door. You try to get some more sleep. At midnight they give us the body. And then we get the hell out of here. The center is not a stable place for anybody.""
""If you say so.""
Mr. Nancy inhaled on his cigarillo. ""This should never have happened,"" he said. ""None of this should have happened. Our kind of people, we are..."" he waved the cigarillo about, as if using it to hunt for a word, then stabbing forward with it, ""...exclusive. We're not social. Not even me. Not even Bacchus. Not for long. We walk by ourselves or we stay in our own little groups. We do not play well with others. We like to be adored and respected and worshiped-me, I like them to be tellin' tales about me, tales showing my cleverness. It's a fault, I know, but it's the way I am. We like to be big. Now, in these shabby days, we are small. The new gods rise and fall and rise again. But this is not a country that tolerates gods for long. Brahma creates, Vishnu preserves, Shiva destroys, and the ground is clear for Brahma to create once more.""
""So what are you saying?"" asked Shadow. ""The fighting's over, now? The battle's done?""
Mr. Nancy snorted. ""Are you out of your mind? They killed Wednesday. They killed him and they bragged about it. They spread the word. They've showed it on every channel to those with eyes to see it. No, Shadow. It's only just begun.""
He bent down at the foot of the stone monument, stubbed out his cigarillo on the earth, and left it there, like an offering.
""You used to make jokes,"" said Shadow. ""You don't any more.""
""It's hard to find the jokes these days. Wednesday's dead. Are you comin' inside?""
""Soon.""
Nancy walked away, toward the motel. Shadow reached out his hand and touched the monument's stones. He dragged his big fingers across the cold brass plate. Then he turned and walked over to the tiny white church, walked through the open doorway, into the darkness. He sat down in the nearest pew and closed his eyes and lowered his head, and thought about Laura, and about Wednesday, and about being alive.
There was a click from behind him, and a scuff of shoe against earth. Shadow sat up, and turned. Someone stood just outside the open doorway, a dark shape against the stars. Moonlight glinted from something metal.
""You going to shoot me?"" asked Shadow.
""Jesus-I wish,"" said Mr. Town. ""It's only for self-defense. So, you're praying? Have they got you thinking that they're gods? They aren't gods.""
""I wasn't praying,"" said Shadow. ""Just thinking.""
""The way I figure it,"" said Town, ""they're mutations. Evolutionary experiments. A little hypnotic ability, a little hocus-pocus, and they can make people believe anything. Nothing to write home about. That's all. They die like men, after all.""
""They always did,"" said Shadow. He got up, and Town took a step back. Shadow walked out of the little chapel, and Mr. Town kept his distance. ""Hey,"" Shadow said. ""Do you know who Louise Brooks was?""
""Friend of yours?""
""Nope. She was a movie star from south of here.""
Town paused. ""Maybe she changed her name, and became Liz Taylor or Sharon Stone or someone,"" he suggested, helpfully.
""Maybe."" Shadow started to walk back to the motel. Town kept pace with him.
""You should be back in prison,"" said Mr. Town. ""You should be on fucking death row.""
""I didn't kill your associates,"" said Shadow. ""But I'll tell you something a guy once told me, back when I was in prison. Something I've never forgotten.""
""And that is?""
""There was only one guy in the whole Bible Jesus ever personally promised a place with him in Paradise. Not Peter, not Paul, not any of those guys. He was a convicted thief, being executed. So don't knock the guys on death row. Maybe they know something you don't.""
The driver stood by the Humvee. ""G'night, gentlemen,"" he said, as they passed.
""Night,"" said Mr. Town. And then he said, to Shadow, ""I personally don't give a fuck about any of this. What I do, is what Mr. World says. It's easier that way.""
Shadow walked down the corridor to room nine.
He unlocked the door, went inside. He said, ""Sorry. I thought this was my room.""
""It is,"" said Media. ""I was waiting for you."" He could see her hair in the moonlight, and her pale face. She was sitting on his bed, primly.
""I'll find another room.""
""I won't be here for long,"" she said. ""I just thought it might be an appropriate time to make you an offer.""
""Okay. Make the offer.""
""Relax,"" she said. There was a smile in her voice. ""You have such a stick up your butt. Look, Wednesday's dead. You don't owe anyone anything. Throw in with us. Time to Come Over to the Winning Team.""
Shadow said nothing.
""We can make you famous, Shadow. We can give you power over what people believe and say and wear and dream. You want to be the next Cary Grant? We can make that happen. We can make you the next Beatles.""
""I think I preferred it when you were offering to show me Lucy's tits,"" said Shadow. ""If that was you.""
""Ah,"" she said.
""I need my room back. Good night.""
""And then of course,"" she said, not moving, as if he had not spoken, ""we can turn it all around. We can make it bad for you. You could be a bad joke forever, Shadow. Or you could be remembered as a monster. You could be remembered forever, but as a Manson, a Hitler...how would you like that?""
""I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm kind of tired,"" said Shadow. ""I'd be grateful if you'd leave now.""
""I offered you the world,"" she said. ""When you're dying in a gutter, you remember that.""
""I'll make a point of it,"" he said.
After she had gone her perfume lingered. He lay on the bare mattress and thought about Laura, but whatever he thought about-Laura playing Frisbee, Laura eating a root-beer float without a spoon, Laura giggling, showing off the exotic underwear she had bought when she attended a travel agents' convention in Anaheim-always morphed, in his mind, into Laura sucking Robbie's cock as a truck slammed them off the road and into oblivion. And then he heard her words, and they hurt every time.
You're not dead, said Laura in her quiet voice, in his head. But I'm not sure that you're alive, either.
There was a knock. Shadow got up and opened the door. It was the fat kid. ""Those hamburgers,"" he said. ""They were just icky. Can you believe it? Fifty miles from McDonald's. I didn't think there was anywhere in the world that was fifty miles from McDonald's.""
""This place is turning into Grand Central Station,"" said Shadow. ""Okay, so I guess you're here to offer me the freedom of the Internet if I come over to your side of the fence. Right?""
The fat kid was shivering. ""No. You're already dead meat,"" he said. ""You-you're a fucking illuminated gothic black-letter manuscript. You couldn't be hypertext if you tried. I'm...I'm synaptic, while, while you're synoptic..."" He smelled strange, Shadow realized. There was a guy in the cell across the way, whose name Shadow had never known. He had taken off all his clothes in the middle of the day and told everyone that he had been sent to take them away, the truly good ones, like him, in a silver spaceship to a perfect place. That had been the last time Shadow had seen him. The fat kid smelled like that guy.
""Are you here for a reason?""
""Just wanted to talk,"" said the fat kid. There was a whine in his voice. ""It's creepy in my room. That's all. It's creepy in there. Fifty miles to a McDonald's, can you believe that? Maybe I could stay in here with you.""
""What about your friends from the limo? The ones who hit me? Shouldn't you ask them to stay with you?""
""The children wouldn't operate out here. We're in a dead zone.""
Shadow said, ""It's a while until midnight, and it's longer to dawn. I think maybe you need rest. I know I do.""
The fat kid said nothing for a moment, then he nodded, and walked out of the room.
Shadow closed his door, and locked it with the key. He lay back on the mattress.
After a few moments the noise began. It took him a few moments to figure out what it had to be, then he unlocked his door and walked out into the hallway. It was the fat kid, now back in his own room. It sounded like he was throwing something huge against the walls of the room. From the sounds, Shadow guessed that what he was throwing was himself. ""It's just me!"" he was sobbing. Or perhaps, ""It's just meat."" Shadow could not tell.
""Quiet!"" came a bellow from Czernobog's room, down the hall.
Shadow walked down to the lobby and out of the motel. He was tired.
The driver still stood beside the Humvee, a dark shape in a peaked cap.
""Couldn't sleep, sir?"" he asked.
""No,"" said Shadow.
""Cigarette, sir?""
""No, thank you.""
""You don't mind if I do?""
""Go right ahead.""
The driver used a Bic disposable lighter, and it was in the yellow light of the flame that Shadow saw the man's face, actually saw it for the first time, and recognized him, and began to understand.
Shadow knew that thin face. He knew that there would be close-cropped orange hair beneath the black driver's cap, cut close to the scalp like the embers of a fire. He knew that when the man's lips smiled they would crease into a network of rough scars.
""You're looking good, big guy,"" said the driver.
""Low Key?"" Shadow stared at his old cellmate warily.
Prison friendships are good things: they get you through bad places and through dark times. But a prison friendship ends at the prison gates, and a prison friend who reappears in your life is at best a mixed blessing.
""Jesus. Low Key Lyesmith,"" said Shadow, and then he heard what he was saying and he understood. ""Loki,"" he said. ""Loki Lie-Smith.""
""You're slow,"" said Loki, ""but you get there in the end."" And his lips twisted into a crooked smile and embers danced in the shadows of his eyes.
  
They sat in Shadow's room in the abandoned motel, sitting on the bed, at opposite ends of the mattress. The sounds from the fat kid's room had pretty much stopped.
""You lied to me,"" said Shadow.
""It's one of the things I'm good at,"" said Loki. ""But you were lucky we were inside together. You would never have survived your first year without me.""
""You couldn't have walked out if you wanted?""
""It's easier just to do the time. You got to understand the god thing. It's not magic. Not exactly. It's about focus. It's about being you, but the you that people believe in. It's about being the concentrated, magnified essence of you. It's about becoming thunder, or the power of a running horse, or wisdom. You take all the belief, all the prayers, and they become a kind of certainty, something that lets you become bigger, cooler, more than human. You crystallize."" He paused. ""And then one day they forget about you, and they don't believe in you, and they don't sacrifice, and they don't care, and the next thing you know you're running a three-card monte game on the corner of Broadway and Forty-third.""
""Why were you in my cell?""
""Coincidence. Pure and simple. That was where they put me. You don't believe me? It's true.""
""And now you're a driver?""
""I do other stuff too.""
""Driving for the opposition.""
""If you want to call them that. It depends where you're standing. The way I figure it, I'm driving for the winning team.""
""But you and Wednesday, you were from the same, you're both-""
""Norse pantheon. We're both from the Norse pantheon. Is that what you're trying to say?""
""Yeah.""
""So?""
Shadow hesitated. ""You must have been friends. Once.""
""No. We were never friends. I'm not sorry he's dead. He was just holding the rest of us back. With him gone, the rest of them are going to have to face up to the facts: it's change or die, evolve or perish. I'm all for evolution-it's the old change-or-die game. He's dead. War's over.""
Shadow looked at him, puzzled. ""You aren't that stupid,"" he said. ""You were always so sharp. Wednesday's death isn't going to end anything. It's just pushed all of the ones who were on the fence over the edge.""
""Mixing metaphors, Shadow. Bad habit.""
""Whatever,"" said Shadow. ""It's still true. Jesus. His death did in an instant what he'd spent the last few months trying to do. It united them. It gave them something to believe in.""
""Perhaps."" Loki shrugged. ""As far as I know, the thinking on this side of the fence was that with the troublemaker out of the way, the trouble would also be gone. It's not any of my business, though. I just drive.""
""So tell me,"" said Shadow, ""why does everyone care about me? They act like I'm important. Why does it matter what I do.""
""You're an investment,"" said Loki. ""You were important to us because you were important to Wednesday. As for the why of it...I don't think any of us know. He did. He's dead. Just another one of life's little mysteries.""
""I'm tired of mysteries.""
""Yeah? I think they add a kind of zest to the world. Like salt in a stew.""
""So you're their driver. You drive for all of them?""
""Whoever needs me,"" said Loki. ""It's a living.""
He raised his wristwatch to his face, pressed a button: the dial glowed a gentle blue, which illuminated his face, giving it a haunting, haunted appearance. ""Five to midnight. Time,"" said Loki. ""Time to light the candles. Say a few words about the dearly departed. Do the formalities. You coming?""
Shadow took a deep breath. ""I'm coming,"" he said.
They walked down the dark motel corridor. ""I bought some candles for this, but there were plenty of old ones around too,"" said Loki. ""Old stumps and stubs and candle-ends in the rooms, and in a box in a closet. I don't think I missed any. And I got a box of matches. You start lighting candles with a lighter, the end gets too hot.""
They reached room five.
""You want to come in?"" asked Loki.
Shadow didn't want to enter that room. ""Okay,"" he said. They went in.
Loki took a box of matches from his pocket, and thumb-nailed a match into flame. The momentary flare hurt Shadow's eyes. A candlewick flickered and caught. And another. Loki lit a new match, and continued to light candles: they were on the windowsills and on the headboard of the bed and on the sink in the corner of the room. They showed him the room by candlelight.
The bed had been hauled from its position against the wall into the middle of the motel room, leaving a few feet of space between the bed and the wall on each side. There were sheets draped over the bed, old motel sheets, moth-holed and stained, which Loki must have found in a closet somewhere. On top of the sheets lay Wednesday, perfectly still.
He was fully dressed, in the pale suit he had been wearing when he was shot. The right side of his face was untouched, perfect, unmarred by blood. The left side of his face was a ragged mess, and the left shoulder and front of the suit was spattered with dark spots, a pointillist mess. His hands were at his sides. The expression on that wreck of a face was far from peaceful: it looked hurt-a soul-hurt, a real down deep hurt, filled with hatred and anger and raw craziness. And, on some level, it looked satisfied.
Shadow imagined Mr. Jacquel's practiced hands smoothing that hatred and pain away, rebuilding a face for Wednesday with mortician's wax and make-up, giving him a final peace and dignity that even death had denied him.
Still, the body seemed no smaller in death. It had not shrunk. And it still smelled faintly of Jack Daniel's.
The wind from the plains was rising: he could hear it howling around the old motel at the exact imaginary center of America. The candles on the windowsill guttered and flickered.
He could hear footsteps in the hallway. Someone knocked on a door, called, ""Hurry up please, it's time,"" and they began to shuffle in, heads lowered.
Town came in first, followed by Media and Mr. Nancy and Czernobog. Last of all came the fat kid: he had fresh red bruises on his face, and his lips were moving all the time, as if he were reciting some words to himself, but he was making no sound. Shadow found himself feeling sorry for him.
Informally, without a word being spoken, they ranged themselves about the body, each an arm's length away from the next. The atmosphere in the room was religious-deeply religious, in a way that Shadow had never previously experienced. There was no sound but the howling of the wind and the crackling of the candles.
""We are come together, here in this godless place,"" said Loki, ""to pass on the body of this individual to those who will dispose of it properly according to the rites. If anyone would like to say something, say it now.""
""Not me,"" said Town. ""I never properly met the guy. And this whole thing makes me feel uncomfortable.""
Czernobog said, ""These actions will have consequences. You know that? This can only be the start of it all.""
The fat kid started to giggle, a high-pitched, girlish noise. He said, ""Okay. Okay I've got it."" And then, all on one note, he recited:

""Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the center cannot hold...""
 
and then he broke off, his brow creasing. He said, ""Shit. I used to know the whole thing,"" and he rubbed his temples and made a face and was quiet.
And then they were all looking at Shadow. The wind was screaming now. He didn't know what to say. He said, ""This whole thing is pitiful. Half of you killed him or had a hand in his death. Now you're giving us his body. Great. He was an irascible old fuck but I drank his mead and I'm still working for him. That's all.""
Media said, ""In a world where people die every day, I think the important thing to remember is that for each moment of sorrow we get when people leave this world there's a corresponding moment of joy when a new baby comes into this world. That first wail is-well, it's magic, isn't it? Perhaps it's a hard thing to say, but joy and sorrow are like milk and cookies. That's how well they go together. I think we should all take a moment to meditate on that.""
And Mr. Nancy cleared his throat and said, ""So. I got to say it, because nobody else here will. We are at the center of this place: a land that has no time for gods, and here at the center it has less time for us than anywhere. It is a no-man's land, a place of truce, and we observe our truces, here. We have no choice. So. You give us the body of our friend. We accept it. You will pay for this, murder for murder, blood for blood.""
Town said, ""Whatever. You could save yourselves a lot of time and effort by going back to your homes and shooting yourselves in the heads. Cut out the middleman.""
""Fuck you,"" said Czernobog. ""Fuck you and fuck your mother and fuck the fucking horse you fucking rode in on. You will not even die in battle. No warrior will taste your blood. No one alive will take your life. You will die a soft, poor death. You will die with a kiss on your lips and a lie in your heart.""
""Leave it, old man,"" said Town.
""The blood-dimmed tide is loose,"" said the fat kid. ""I think that comes next.""
The wind howled.
""Okay,"" said Loki. ""He's yours. We're done. Take the old bastard away.""
He made a gesture with his fingers, and Town, Media and the fat kid left the room. He smiled at Shadow. ""Call no man happy, huh, kid?"" he said. And then he, too, walked away.
""What happens now?"" asked Shadow.
""Now we wrap him up,"" said Anansi. ""And we take him away from here.""
They wrapped the body in the motel sheets, wrapped it well in its impromptu shroud, so there was no body to be seen, and they could carry it. The two old men walked to each end of the body, but Shadow said, ""Let me see something,"" and he bent his knees and slipped his arms around the white-sheeted figure, pushed him up and over his shoulder. He straightened his knees, until he was standing, more or less easily. ""Okay,"" he said. ""I've got him. Let's put him into the back of the car.""
Czernobog looked as if he were about to argue, but he closed his mouth. He spat on his forefinger and thumb and began to snuff the candles between his fingertips. Shadow could hear them fizz as he walked from the darkening room.
Wednesday was heavy, but Shadow could cope, if he walked steadily. He had no choice. Wednesday's words were in his head with every step he took along the corridor, and he could taste the sour-sweetness of mead in the back of his throat. You work for me. You protect me. You help me. You transport me from place to place. You investigate, from time to time-go places and ask questions for me. You run errands. In an emergency, but only in an emergency, you hurt people who need to be hurt. In the unlikely event of my death, you will hold my vigil...
A deal was a deal, and this one was in his blood and in his bones.
Mr. Nancy opened the motel lobby door for him, then hurried over and opened the back of the bus. The other four were already standing by their Humvee, watching them as if they could not wait to be off. Loki had put his driver's cap back on. The cold wind whipped at the sheets, tugged at Shadow as he walked.
He placed Wednesday down as gently as he could in the back of the bus.
Someone tapped him on the shoulder. He turned. Town stood there with his hand out. He was holding something.
""Here,"" said Mr. Town, ""Mister World wanted you to have this."" It was a glass eye. There was a hairline crack down the middle of it, and a tiny chip gone from the front. ""We found it in the Masonic hall, when we were cleaning up. Keep it for luck. God knows you'll need it.""
Shadow closed his hand around the eye. He wished he could come back with something smart and sharp and clever, but Town was already back at the Humvee, and climbing up into the car; and Shadow still couldn't think of anything clever to say.
  
Czernobog was the last person out of the motel. As he locked the building he watched the Humvee pull out of the park and head off down the blacktop. He put the key to the motel beneath a rock by the lobby door, and he shook his head. ""I should have eaten his heart,"" he said to Shadow, conversationally. ""Not just cursed his death. He needs to be taught respect."" He climbed into the back of the bus.
""You ride shotgun,"" said Mr. Nancy to Shadow. ""I'll drive a while.""
He drove east.
  
Dawn found them in Prince ton, Missouri. Shadow had not slept yet.
Nancy said, ""Anywhere you want us to drop you? If I were you, I'd rustle up some ID and head for Canada. Or Mexico.""
""I'm sticking with you guys,"" said Shadow. ""It's what Wednesday would have wanted.""
""You aren't working for him any more. He's dead. Once we drop his body off, you are free to go.""
""And do what?""
""Keep out of the way, while the war is on. Like I say, you should leave the country,"" said Nancy. He flipped his turn signal, and took a left.
""Hide yourself, for a little time,"" said Czernobog. ""Then, when this is over, you will come back to me, and I will finish the whole thing. With my hammer.""
Shadow said, ""Where are we taking the body?""
""Virginia. There's a tree,"" said Nancy.
""A world tree,"" said Czernobog with gloomy satisfaction. ""We had one in my part of the world. But ours grew under the world, not above it.""
""We put him at the foot of the tree,"" said Nancy. ""We leave him there. We let you go. We drive south. There's a battle. Blood is shed. Many die. The world changes, a little.""
""You don't want me at your battle? I'm pretty big. I'm good in a fight.""
Nancy turned his head to Shadow and smiled-the first real smile Shadow had seen on Mr. Nancy's face since he had rescued Shadow from the Lumber County Jail. ""Most of this battle will be fought in a place you cannot go, and you cannot touch.""
""In the hearts and the minds of the people,"" said Czernobog. ""Like at the big roundabout.""
""Huh?""
""The carousel,"" said Mr. Nancy.
""Oh,"" said Shadow. ""Backstage. I got it. Like the desert with all the bones in it.""
Mr. Nancy raised his head. ""Backstage. Yes. Every time I figure you don't have enough sense to bring guts to a bear, you surprise me. That's right. Backstage. That's where the real battle will happen. Everything else will just be flash and thunder.""
""Tell me about the vigil,"" said Shadow.
""Someone has to stay with the body. It's a tradition. One of our people will do it.""
""He wanted me to do it.""
""No,"" said Czernobog. ""It will kill you. Bad, bad, bad idea.""
""Yeah? It'll kill me? To stay with his body?""
""It's what happens when the all-father dies,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""It wouldn't be true for me. When I die, I just want them to plant me somewhere warm. And then when pretty women walk over my grave I would grab their ankles, like in that movie.""
""I never saw that movie,"" said Czernobog.
""Of course you did. It's right at the end. It's the high school movie. All the children going to the prom.""
Czernobog shook his head.
Shadow said, ""The film's called Carrie, Mister Czernobog. Okay, one of you tell me about the vigil.""
Nancy said, ""You tell him. I'm drivin'.""
""I never heard of no film called Carrie. You tell him.""
Nancy said, ""The person on the vigil-gets tied to the tree. Just like Wednesday was. And then they hang there for nine days and nine nights. No food, no water. All alone. At the end they cut the person down, and if they lived...well, it could happen. And Wednesday will have had his vigil.""
Czernobog said, ""Maybe Alviss will send us one of his people. A dwarf could survive it.""
""I'll do it,"" said Shadow.
""No,"" said Mr. Nancy.
""Yes,"" said Shadow.
The two old men were silent. Then Nancy said, ""Why?""
""Because it's the kind of thing a living person would do,"" said Shadow.
""You are crazy,"" said Czernobog.
""Maybe. But I'm going to hold Wednesday's vigil.""
When they stopped for gas Czernobog announced he felt sick, and wanted to ride in the front. Shadow didn't mind moving to the back of the bus. He could stretch out more, and sleep.
They drove on in silence. Shadow felt that he'd done something very big and very strange, and he wasn't certain exactly what it was.
""Hey. Czernobog,"" said Mr. Nancy, after a while. ""You check out the technical boy back at the motel? He was not happy. He's been screwin' with something that screwed him right back. That's the biggest trouble with the new kids-they figure they know everythin', and you can't teach them nothin' but the hard way.""
""Good,"" said Czernobog.
Shadow was stretched out full length on the seat in the back. He felt like two people, or more than two. There was part of him that felt gently exhilarated: he had done something. He had moved. It wouldn't have mattered if he hadn't wanted to live, but he did want to live, and that made all the difference. He hoped he would live through this, but he was willing to die, if that was what it took to be alive. And, for a moment he thought that the whole thing was funny, just the funniest thing in the world; and he wondered if Laura would appreciate the joke.
There was another part of him-maybe it was Mike Ainsel, he thought, vanished off into nothing at the press of a button in the Lakeside Police Department-who was still trying to figure it all out, trying to see the big picture.
""Hidden Indians,"" he said out loud.
""What?"" came Czernobog's irritated croak from the front seat.
""The pictures you'd get to color in as kids. 'Can you see the hidden Indians in this picture? There are ten Indians in this picture, can you find them all?' And at first glance you could only see the waterfall and the rocks and the trees, then you see that if you just tip the picture on its side that shadow is an Indian..."" He yawned.
""Sleep,"" suggested Czernobog.
""But the big picture,"" said Shadow. Then he slept, and dreamed of hidden Indians.
  
The tree was in Virginia. It was a long way away from anywhere, on the back of an old farm. To get to the farm they had had to drive for almost an hour south from Blacksburg, to drive roads with names like Pennywinkle Branch and Rooster Spur. They got turned around twice and Mr. Nancy and Czernobog both lost their tempers with Shadow and with each other.
They stopped to get directions at a tiny general store, set at the bottom of the hill in the place where the road forked. An old man came out of the back of the store and stared at them: he wore OshKosh B'gosh denim overalls and nothing else, not even shoes. Czernobog bought a pickled hog's foot from the huge jar of hogs' feet on the counter, and went outside to eat it on the deck, while Nancy and the man in the overalls took turns drawing each other maps on the back of napkins, marking off turnings and local landmarks.
They set off once more, with Mr. Nancy driving, and they were there in ten minutes. A sign on the gate said ASH.
Shadow got out of the bus, and opened the gate. The bus drove through, jolting through the meadowland. Shadow closed the gate. He walked a little behind the bus, stretching his legs, jogging when the bus got too far in front of him. Enjoying the sensation of moving his body.
He had lost all sense of time on the drive from Kansas. Had they been driving for two days? Three days? He did not know.
The body in the back of the bus did not seem to be rotting. He could smell it-a faint odor of Jack Daniel's, overlaid with something that might have been sour honey. But the smell was not unpleasant. From time to time he would take out the glass eye from his pocket and look at it: it was shattered deep inside, fractured from what he imagined was the impact of a bullet, but apart from a chip to one side of the iris the surface was unmarred. Shadow would run it through his hands, palming it, rolling it, pushing it along with his fingers. It was a ghastly souvenir, but oddly comforting: and he suspected that it would have amused Wednesday to know that his eye had wound up in Shadow's pocket.
The farmhouse was dark and shut up. The meadows were overgrown and seemed abandoned. The building's roof was crumbling at the back; it was covered in black plastic sheeting. They jolted over a ridge and Shadow saw the tree.
It was silver-gray and it was higher than the farmhouse. It was the most beautiful tree Shadow had ever seen: spectral and yet utterly real and almost perfectly symmetrical. It also looked instantly familiar: he wondered if he had dreamed it, then realized that no, he had seen it before, or a representation of it, many times. It was Wednesday's silver tiepin.
The VW bus jolted and bumped across the meadow, and came to a stop about twenty feet from the trunk of the tree.
There were three women standing by the tree. At first glance Shadow thought that they were the Zorya, but he realized in moments that he was mistaken. They were three women he did not know. They looked tired and bored, as if they had been standing there for a long time. Each of them held a wooden ladder. The biggest one of them also carried a brown sack. They looked like a set of Russian dolls: a tall one-she was Shadow's height, or even taller-a middle-sized one, and a woman so short and hunched that at first glance Shadow wrongly supposed her to be a child. Still, they looked so much alike-something in the forehead, or the eyes, or the set of the chin-that Shadow was certain that the women must be sisters.
The smallest of the women dropped to a curtsy when the bus drew up. The other two just stared. They were sharing a cigarette, and they smoked it down to the filter before one of them stubbed it out against a root.
Czernobog opened the back of the bus and the biggest of the women pushed past him, and, easily as if it were a sack of flour, she lifted Wednesday's body out of the back and carried it to the tree. She laid it in front of the tree, put it down about ten feet from the trunk. She and her sisters unwrapped Wednesday's body. He looked worse by daylight than he had by candlelight in the motel room, and after one quick glance Shadow looked away. The women arranged his clothes, tidied his suit, then placed him at the corner of the sheet, and wound it around him once more.
Then the women came over to Shadow.
-You are the one? the biggest of them asked.
-The one who will mourn the all-father? asked the middle-sized one.
-You have chosen to take the vigil? asked the smallest.
Shadow nodded. Afterward, he was unable to remember whether he had actually heard their voices. Perhaps he had simply understood what they had meant from their looks and their eyes.
Mr. Nancy, who had gone back to the house to use the bathroom, came walking back to the tree. He was smoking a cigarillo. He looked thoughtful.
""Shadow,"" he called. ""You really don't have to do this. We can find somebody more suited. You ain't ready for this.""
""I'm doing it,"" said Shadow, simply.
""You don't have to,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""You don't know what you're lettin' yourself in for.""
""It doesn't matter,"" said Shadow.
""And if you die?"" asked Mr. Nancy. ""If it kills you?""
""Then,"" said Shadow, ""it kills me.""
Mr. Nancy flicked his cigarillo into the meadow, angrily. ""I said you had shit for brains, and you still have shit for brains. Can't see when somebody's tryin' to give you an out?""
""I'm sorry,"" said Shadow. He didn't say anything else. Nancy walked back to the bus.
Czernobog walked over to Shadow. He did not look pleased. ""You must come through this alive,"" he said. ""Come through this safely for me."" And then he tapped his knuckle gently against Shadow's forehead and said, ""Bam!"" He squeezed Shadow's shoulder, patted his arm, and walked back to the bus.
The biggest woman, whose name seemed to be Urtha or Urder-Shadow could not repeat it back to her to her satisfaction-told him, in pantomime, to take off his clothes.
""All of them?""
The big woman shrugged. Shadow stripped to his briefs and T-shirt. The women propped the ladders against the tree. One of the ladders-it was painted by hand, with little flowers and leaves twining up the struts-they pointed out to him.
He climbed the nine steps. Then, at their urging, he stepped onto a low branch.
The middle woman tipped out the contents of the sack onto the meadow-grass. It was filled with a tangle of thin ropes, brown with age and dirt, and the woman began to sort them out into lengths, and to lay them carefully on the ground beside Wednesday's body.
They climbed their own ladders now, and they began to knot the ropes, intricate and elegant knots, and they wrapped the ropes first about the tree, and then about Shadow. Unembarrassed, like midwives or nurses or those who lay out corpses, they removed his T-shirt and briefs, then they bound him, never tightly, but firmly and finally. He was amazed at how comfortably the ropes and the knots bore his weight. The ropes went under his arms, between his legs, around his waist, his ankles, his chest, binding him to the tree.
The final rope was tied, loosely, about his neck. It was initially uncomfortable, but his weight was well distributed and none of the ropes cut his flesh.
His feet were five feet above the ground. The tree was leafless and huge, its branches black against the gray sky, its bark a smooth silvery gray.
They took the ladders away. There was a moment of panic as he dropped a few inches, as all his weight was taken by the ropes. He made no sound.
He was entirely naked by that point.
The women placed the body, wrapped in its motel-sheet shroud, at the foot of the tree, and they left him there.
They left him there alone.

Madam Life's a piece in bloom
Death goes dogging everywhere:
She's the tenant of the room,
He's the ruffian on the stair.
-W. E. HENLEY, ""MADAM LIFE'S A PIECE IN BLOOM"" 
Only Zorya Utrennyaya was awake to say goodbye to them, that Saturday morning. She took Wednesday's forty-five dollars and insisted on writing him out a receipt for it in wide, looping handwriting, on the back of an expired soft-drink coupon. She looked quite doll-like in the morning light, with her old face carefully made-up and her golden hair piled high upon her head.
Wednesday kissed her hand. ""Thank you for your hospitality, dear lady,"" he said. ""You and your lovely sisters remain as radiant as the sky itself.""
""You are a bad old man,"" she told him, and shook a finger at him. Then she hugged him. ""Keep safe,"" she told him. ""I would not like to hear that you were gone for good.""
""It would distress me equally, my dear.""
She shook hands with Shadow. ""Zorya Polunochnaya thinks very highly of you,"" she said. ""I also.""
""Thank you,"" said Shadow. ""Thanks for the dinner.""
She raised an eyebrow at him. ""You liked? You must come again.""
Wednesday and Shadow walked down the stairs. Shadow put his hands in his jacket pockets. The silver dollar was cold in his hand. It was bigger and heavier than any coins he'd used so far. He classic-palmed it, let his hand hang by his side naturally, then straightened his hand as the coin slipped down to a front-palm position. It felt natural there, held between his forefinger and his little finger by the slightest of pressure.
""Smoothly done,"" said Wednesday.
""I'm just learning,"" said Shadow. ""I can do a lot of the technical stuff. The hardest part is making people look at the wrong hand.""
""Is that so?""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""It's called misdirection."" He slipped his middle fingers under the coin, pushing it into a back palm, and fumbled his grip on it, ever-so-slightly. The coin dropped from his hand to the stairwell with a clatter and bounced down half a flight of stairs. Wednesday reached down and picked it up.
""You cannot afford to be careless with people's gifts,"" said Wednesday. ""Something like this, you need to hang on to it. Don't go throwing it about."" He examined the coin, looking first at the eagle side, then at the face of Liberty on the obverse. ""Ah, Lady Liberty. Beautiful, is she not?"" He tossed the coin to Shadow, who picked it from the air, did a slide vanish-seeming to drop it into his left hand while actually keeping it in his right-and then appeared to pocket it with his left hand. The coin sat in the palm of his right hand, in plain view. It felt comforting there.
""Lady Liberty,"" said Wednesday. ""Like so many of the gods that Americans hold dear, a foreigner. In this case, a Frenchwoman, although, in deference to American sensibilities, the French covered up her magnificent bosom on that statue they presented to New York. Liberty,"" he continued, wrinkling his nose at the used condom that lay on the bottom flight of steps, toeing it to the side of the stairs with distaste. ""Someone could slip on that. Break their necks,"" he muttered, interrupting himself. ""Like a banana peel, only with bad taste and irony thrown in."" He pushed open the door, and the sunlight hit them. The world outside was colder than it had looked from indoors: Shadow wondered if there was more snow to come. ""Liberty,"" boomed Wednesday, as they walked to his car, ""is a bitch who must be bedded on a mattress of corpses.""
""Yeah?"" said Shadow.
""Quoting,"" said Wednesday. ""Quoting someone French. That's who they have a statue to, in their New York harbor: a bitch, who liked to be fucked on the refuse from the tumbril. Hold your torch as high as you want to, m'dear, there's still rats in your dress and cold jism dripping down your leg."" He unlocked the car, and pointed Shadow to the passenger seat.
""I think she's beautiful,"" said Shadow, holding the coin up close. Liberty's silver face reminded him a little of Zorya Polunochnaya.
""That,"" said Wednesday, driving off, ""is the eternal folly of man. To be chasing after the sweet flesh, without realizing that it is simply a pretty cover for the bones. Worm food. At night, you're rubbing yourself against worm food. No offense meant.""
Shadow had never seen Wednesday quite so expansive. His new boss, he decided, went through phases of extroversion followed by periods of intense quiet. ""So you aren't American?"" asked Shadow.
""Nobody's American,"" said Wednesday. ""Not originally. That's my point."" He checked his watch. ""We still have several hours to kill before the banks close. Good job last night with Czernobog, by the way. I would have closed him on coming eventually, but you enlisted him more wholeheartedly than ever I could have.""
""Only because he gets to kill me afterward.""
""Not necessarily. As you yourself so wisely pointed out, he's old, and the killing stroke might merely leave you, well, paralyzed for life, say. A hopeless invalid. So you have much to look forward to, should Mister Czernobog survive the coming difficulties.""
""And there is some question about this?"" said Shadow, echoing Wednesday's manner, then hating himself for it.
""Fuck yes,"" said Wednesday. He pulled up in the parking lot of a bank. ""This,"" he said, ""is the bank I shall be robbing. They don't close for another few hours. Let's go in and say hello.""
He gestured to Shadow. Reluctantly, Shadow got out of the car and followed Wednesday in. If the old man was going to do something stupid, Shadow could see no reason why his face should be on the camera; but curiosity pulled him in and he walked into the bank. He looked down at the floor, rubbed his nose with his hand, doing his best to keep his face hidden.
""Deposit forms, ma'am?"" said Wednesday to the lone teller.
""Over there.""
""Very good. And if I were to need to make a night deposit...?""
""Same forms."" She smiled at him. ""You know where the night deposit slot is, hon? Left out the main door, it's on the wall.""
""My thanks.""
Wednesday picked up several deposit forms. He grinned a goodbye at the teller, and he and Shadow walked out.
Wednesday stood there on the sidewalk for a moment, scratching his beard meditatively. Then he walked over to the ATM machine, and to the night safe, set in the side of the wall, and inspected them. He led Shadow across the road to the supermarket, where he bought a chocolate fudge Popsicle for himself, and a cup of hot chocolate for Shadow. There was a payphone set in the wall of the entryway, as you went in, below a notice board with rooms to rent, and puppies and kittens in need of good homes. Wednesday wrote down the telephone number of the payphone. They crossed the road once more. ""What we need,"" said Wednesday, suddenly, ""is snow. A good, driving, irritating snow. Think 'snow' for me, will you?""
""Huh?""
""Concentrate on making those clouds-the ones over there, in the west-making them bigger and darker. Think gray skies and driving winds coming down from the arctic. Think snow.""
""I don't think it will do any good.""
""Nonsense. If nothing else, it will keep your mind occupied,"" said Wednesday, unlocking the car. ""Kinko's next. Hurry up.""
Snow, thought Shadow, in the passenger seat, sipping his hot chocolate. Huge, dizzying, clumps and clusters of snow falling through the air, patches of white against an iron-gray sky, snow that touches your tongue with cold and winter, that kisses your face with its hesitant touch before freezing you to death. Twelve cotton-candy inches of snow, creating a fairy-tale world, making everything unrecognizably beautiful...
Wednesday was talking to him.
""I'm sorry?"" said Shadow.
""I said we're here,"" said Wednesday. ""You were somewhere else.""
""I was thinking about snow,"" said Shadow.
In Kinko's, Wednesday set about photocopying the deposit slips from the bank. He had the clerk instant-print him two sets of ten business cards. Shadow's head had begun to ache, and there was an uncomfortable feeling between his shoulder blades; he wondered if he had slept on it wrong, if it was an awkward legacy of the night before's sofa.
Wednesday sat at the computer terminal, composing a letter, and, with the clerk's help, making several large-sized signs.
Snow, thought Shadow. High in the atmosphere, perfect, tiny crystals that form about a minute piece of dust, each a lace-like work of unique, six-sided fractal art. And the snow crystals clump together into flakes as they fall, covering Chicago in their white plenty, inch upon inch...
""Here,"" said Wednesday. He handed Shadow a cup of Kinko's coffee, a half-dissolved lump of non-dairy creamer powder floating on the top. ""I think that's enough, don't you?""
""Enough what?""
""Enough snow. Don't want to immobilize the city, do we?""
The sky was a uniform battleship gray. Snow was coming. Yes.
""I didn't really do that?"" said Shadow. ""I mean, I didn't. Did I?""
""Drink the coffee,"" said Wednesday. ""It's foul stuff, but it will ease the headache."" Then he said, ""Good work.""
Wednesday paid the Kinko's clerk, and he carried his signs and letters and cards outside to the car. He opened the trunk of his car, put the papers in a large black metal case of the kind carried by payroll guards, and closed the trunk. He passed Shadow a business card.
""Who,"" said Shadow, ""is A. Haddock, Director of Security, A1 Security Services?""
""You are.""
""A. Haddock?""
""Yes.""
""What does the A stand for?""
""Alfredo? Alphonse? Augustine? Ambrose? Your call entirely.""
""Oh. I see.""
""I'm James O'Gorman,"" said Wednesday. ""Jimmy to my friends. See? I've got a card too.""
They got back in the car. Wednesday said, ""If you can think 'A. Haddock' as well as you thought 'snow,' we should have plenty of lovely money with which to wine and dine my friends of tonight.""
""And if we're in jail by this evening?""
""Then my friends will just have to make do without us.""
""I'm not going back to prison.""
""You won't be.""
""I thought we had agreed that I wouldn't be doing anything illegal.""
""You aren't. Possibly aiding and abetting, a little conspiracy to commit, followed of course by receiving stolen money, but trust me, you'll come out of this smelling like a rose.""
""Is that before or after your elderly Slavic Charles Atlas crushes my skull with one blow?""
""His eyesight's going,"" said Wednesday reassuringly. ""He'll probably miss you entirely. Now, we still have a little time to kill-the bank closes at midday on Saturdays, after all. Would you like lunch?""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""I'm starving.""
""I know just the place,"" said Wednesday. He hummed as he drove, some cheerful song that Shadow could not identify. Snowflakes began to fall, just as Shadow had imagined them, and he felt strangely proud. He knew, rationally, that he had nothing to do with the snow, just as he knew the silver dollar he carried in his pocket was not, and never had been, the moon. But still...
They stopped outside a large shed-like building. A sign said that the All-U-Can-Eat lunch buffet was $4.99. ""I love this place,"" said Wednesday.
""Good food?"" asked Shadow.
""Not particularly,"" said Wednesday. ""But the ambience is unmissable.""
The ambience that Wednesday loved, it turned out, once lunch had been eaten-Shadow had the fried chicken, and enjoyed it-was the business that took up the rear of the shed: it was, the hanging flag across the center of the room announced, a Bankrupt and Liquidated Stock Clearance Depot.
Wednesday went out to the car, and reappeared with a small suitcase, which he took into the men's room. Shadow figured he'd learn soon enough what Wednesday was up to, whether he wanted to or not, and so he prowled the liquidation aisles, staring at the things for sale: boxes of coffee ""for use in airline filters only,"" Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle toys and Xena: Warrior Princess harem dolls, teddy bears that played patriotic tunes on the xylophone when plugged in, and other teddy bears that played seasonal songs on the xylophone when plugged in, cans of processed meat, galoshes and sundry overshoes, marshmallows, Bill Clinton presidential wristwatches, artificial miniature Christmas trees, salt and pepper shakers in the shapes of animals, body parts, fruit and nuns, and, Shadow's favorite, a ""just add real carrot"" snowman kit, with plastic coal eyes, a corncob pipe, and a plastic hat.
Shadow thought about how you made the moon seem to come out of the sky and become a silver dollar, and what made a woman get out of her grave and walk across town to talk to you.
""Isn't it a wonderful place?"" asked Wednesday when he came out of the men's room. His hands were still wet, and he was drying them off on a handkerchief. ""They're out of paper towels in there,"" he said. He had changed his clothes. He was now wearing a dark blue jacket, with matching trousers, a blue knit tie, a thick blue sweater, a white shirt, and black shoes. He looked like a security guard, and Shadow said so.
""What can I possibly say to that, young man,"" said Wednesday, picking up a box of floating plastic aquarium fish (""They'll never fade-and you'll never have to feed them!!""), ""other than to congratulate you on your perspicacity. How about Arthur Haddock? Arthur's a good name.""
""Too mundane.""
""Well, you'll think of something. There. Let us return to town. We should be in perfect time for our bank robbery, and then I shall have a little spending money.""
""Most people,"" said Shadow, ""would simply take it from the ATM.""
""Which is, oddly enough, more or less exactly what I was planning to do.""
Wednesday parked the car in the supermarket lot across the street from the bank. From the trunk of the car Wednesday brought out the metal case and a clipboard, and a pair of handcuffs. He handcuffed the case to his left wrist. He attached the other end of the cuff to the metal case's handle. The snow continued to fall. Then he put a peaked blue cap on, and Velcroed a patch to the breast pocket of his jacket. A1 SECURITY was written on the cap and the patch. He put the deposit slips on his clipboard. Then he slouched. He looked like a retired beat cop, and appeared somehow to have gained himself a paunch.
""Now,"" he said, ""you do a little shopping in the food store, then hang out by the phone. If anyone asks, you're waiting for a call from your girlfriend, whose car has broken down.""
""So why's she calling me there?""
""How the hell should you know?""
Wednesday put on a pair of faded pink earmuffs. He closed the trunk. Snowflakes settled on his dark blue cap, and on his earmuffs.
""How do I look?"" he asked.
""Ludicrous,"" said Shadow.
""Ludicrous?""
""Or goofy, maybe,"" said Shadow.
""Mm. Goofy and ludicrous. That's good."" Wednesday smiled. The earmuffs made him appear, at the same time, reassuring, amusing, and, ultimately, loveable. He strode across the street and walked along the block to the bank building, while Shadow walked into the supermarket hall and watched.
Wednesday taped a large red OUT OF ORDER notice to the ATM. He put a red ribbon across the night deposit slot, and he taped a photocopied sign up above it. Shadow read it with amusement.
FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE, it said, WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE ONGOING IMPROVEMENT'S. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE TEMPORARY INCONVENIENCE.
Then Wednesday turned around and faced the street. He looked cold and put-upon.
A young woman came over to use the ATM. Wednesday shook his head, explained that it was out of order. She cursed, apologized for cursing, and ran off.
A car drew up, and a man got out holding a small gray sack and a key. Shadow watched as Wednesday apologized to the man, then made him sign the clipboard, checked his deposit slip, painstakingly wrote him out a receipt and puzzled over which copy to keep, and, finally, opened his big black metal case and put the man's sack inside.
The man shivered in the snow, stamping his feet, waiting for the old security guard to be done with this administrative nonsense, so he could leave his takings and get out of the cold and be on his way, then he took his receipt and got back into his warm car and drove off.
Wednesday walked across the street carrying the metal case, and bought himself a coffee at the supermarket.
""Afternoon, young man,"" he said, with an avuncular chuckle, as he passed Shadow. ""Cold enough for you?""
He walked back across the street, and took gray sacks and envelopes from people coming to deposit their earnings or their takings on this Saturday afternoon, a fine old security man in his funny pink earmuffs.
Shadow bought some things to read-Turkey Hunting, People, and because the cover picture of Bigfoot was so endearing, the Weekly World News-and stared out of the window.
""Anything I can do to help?"" asked a middle-aged black man with a white moustache. He seemed to be the manager.
""Thanks, man, but no. I'm waiting for a phone call. My girlfriend's car broke down.""
""Probably the battery,"" said the man. ""People forget those things only last three, maybe four years. It's not like they cost a fortune.""
""Tell me about it,"" said Shadow.
""Hang in there, big guy,"" said the manager, and he went back into the supermarket.
The snow had turned the street scene into the interior of a snowglobe, perfect in all its details.
Shadow watched, impressed. Unable to hear the conversations across the street, he felt it was like watching a fine silent movie performance, all pantomime and expression: the old security guard was gruff, earnest-a little bumbling perhaps, but enormously well-meaning. Everyone who gave him their money walked away a little happier from having met him.
And then the cops drew up outside the bank, and Shadow's heart sank. Wednesday tipped his cap to them and ambled over to the police car. He said his hellos and shook hands through the open window, and nodded, then hunted through his pockets until he found a business card and a letter, and passed them through the window of the car. Then he sipped his coffee.
The telephone rang. Shadow picked up the hand piece and did his best to sound bored. ""A1 Security Services,"" he said.
""Can I speak to A. Haddock?"" asked the cop across the street.
""This is Andy Haddock speaking,"" said Shadow.
""Yeah, Mr. Haddock, this is the police,"" said the cop in the car across the street. ""You've got a man at the First Illinois Bank on the corner of Market and Second.""
""Uh, yeah. That's right. Jimmy O'Gorman. And what seems to be the problem, officer? Jim behaving himself? He's not been drinking?""
""No problem, sir. Your man is just fine, sir. Just wanted to make certain everything was in order.""
""You tell Jim that if he's caught drinking again, officer, he's fired. You got that? Out of a job. Out on his ass. We have zero tolerance at A1 Security.""
""I really don't think it's really my place to tell him that, sir. He's doing a fine job. We're just concerned because something like this really ought to be done by two personnel. It's risky, having one unarmed guard dealing with such large amounts of money.""
""Tell me about it. Or more to the point, you tell those cheapskates down at the First Illinois about it. These are my men I'm putting on the line, officer. Good men. Men like you."" Shadow found himself warming to this identity. He could feel himself becoming Andy Haddock, chewed cheap cigar in his ashtray, a stack of paperwork to get to this Saturday afternoon, a home in Schaumburg and a mistress in a little apartment on Lake Shore Drive. ""Y'know, you sound like a bright young man, officer, uh...""
""Myerson.""
""Officer Myerson. You need a little weekend work, or you wind up leaving the force, any reason, you give us a call. We always need good men. You got my card?""
""Yes, sir.""
""You hang on to it,"" said Andy Haddock. ""You call me.""
The police car drove off, and Wednesday shuffled back through the snow to deal with the small line of people who were waiting to give him their money.
""She okay?"" asked the manager, putting his head around the door. ""Your girlfriend?""
""It was the battery,"" said Shadow. ""Now I just got to wait.""
""Women,"" said the manager. ""I hope yours is worth waiting for.""
Winter darkness descended, the afternoon slowly graying into night. Lights went on. More people gave Wednesday their money. Suddenly, as if at some signal Shadow could not see, Wednesday walked over to the wall, removed the OUT OF ORDER signs, and trudged across the slushy road, heading for the car park. Shadow waited a minute, then followed him.
Wednesday was sitting in the back of the car. He had opened the metal case and was methodically laying everything he had been given out on the back seat in neat piles.
""Drive,"" he said. ""We're heading for the First Illinois Bank over on State Street.""
""Repeat performance?"" asked Shadow. ""Isn't that kind of pushing your luck?""
""Not at all,"" said Wednesday. ""We're going to do a little banking.""
While Shadow drove, Wednesday sat in the back seat and removed the bills from the deposit bags in handfuls, leaving the checks and the credit card slips, and taking the cash from some, although not all, of the envelopes. He dropped the cash back into the metal case. Shadow pulled up outside the bank, stopping the car about fifty yards down the road, well out of camera range. Wednesday got out of the car, and pushed the envelopes through the night deposit slot. Then he opened the night safe, and dropped in the gray bags. He closed it again.
He climbed into the passenger seat. ""You're heading for I-90,"" said Wednesday. ""Follow the signs west for Madison.""
Shadow began to drive.
Wednesday looked back at the bank they were leaving. ""There, my boy,"" he said, cheerfully, ""that will confuse everything. Now, to get the really big money, you need to do that at about 4:30 on a Sunday morning, when the clubs and the bars drop off their Saturday night's takings. Hit the right bank, the right guy making the drop off-they tend to pick them big and honest, and sometimes have a couple of bouncers accompany them, but they aren't necessarily smart-and you can walk away with a quarter of a million dollars for an evening's work.""
""If it's that easy,"" said Shadow, ""how come everybody doesn't do it?""
""It's not an entirely risk-free occupation,"" said Wednesday, ""especially not at 4:30 in the morning.""
""You mean the cops are more suspicious at 4:30 in the morning?""
""Not at all. But the bouncers are. And things can get awkward.""
He flicked through a sheaf of fifties, added a smaller stack of twenties, weighed them in his hand, then passed them over to Shadow. ""Here,"" he said. ""Your first week's wages.""
Shadow pocketed the money without counting it. ""So, that's what you do?"" he asked. ""To make money?""
""Rarely. Only when a great deal of cash is needed fast. On the whole, I make my money from people who never know they've been taken, and who never complain, and who will frequently line up to be taken when I come back that way again.""
""That Sweeney guy said you were a hustler.""
""He was right. But that is the least of what I am. And the least of what I need you for, Shadow.""
  
Snow spun through their headlights and into the windshield as they drove through the darkness. The effect was almost hypnotic.
""This is the only country in the world,"" said Wednesday, into the stillness, ""that worries about what it is.""
""What?""
""The rest of them know what they are. No one ever needs to go searching for the heart of Norway. Or looks for the soul of Mozambique. They know what they are.""
""And...?""
""Just thinking out loud.""
""So you've been to lots of other countries, then?""
Wednesday said nothing. Shadow glanced at him. ""No,"" said Wednesday, with a sigh. ""No. I never have.""
They stopped for gas, and Wednesday went into the restroom in his security guard jacket with his suitcase, and came out in a crisp, pale suit, brown shoes, and a knee-length brown coat that looked like it might be Italian.
""So when we get to Madison, what then?""
""Take Highway 14 west to Spring Green. We'll be meeting everyone at a place called the House on the Rock. You been there?""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""But I've seen the signs.""
The signs for the House on the Rock were all around that part of the world: oblique, ambiguous signs all across Illinois and Minnesota and Wisconsin, probably as far away as Iowa, Shadow suspected, signs alerting you to the existence of the House on the Rock. Shadow had seen the signs, and wondered about them. Did the House balance perilously upon the Rock? What was so interesting about the Rock? About the House? He had given it a passing thought, but then forgotten it. Shadow was not in the habit of visiting roadside attractions.
They drove past the capitol dome of Madison, another perfect snowglobe scene in the falling snow, and then they were off the interstate, and driving down country roads. After almost an hour of driving through towns with names like Black Earth, they turned down a narrow driveway, past several enormous, snow-dusted flowerpots entwined with lizard-like dragons. The tree-lined parking lot was almost empty.
""They'll be closing soon,"" said Wednesday.
""So what is this place?"" asked Shadow, as they walked through the parking lot toward a low, unimpressive wooden building.
""This is a roadside attraction,"" said Wednesday. ""One of the finest. Which means it is a place of power.""
""Come again?""
""It's perfectly simple,"" said Wednesday. ""In other countries, over the years, people recognized the places of power. Sometimes it would be a natural formation, sometimes it would just be a place that was, somehow, special. They knew that something important was happening there, that there was some focusing point, some channel, some window to the Immanent. And so they would build temples, or cathedrals, or erect stone circles, or...well, you get the idea.""
""There are churches all across the States, though,"" said Shadow.
""In every town. Sometimes on every block. And about as significant, in this context, as dentists' offices. No, in the USA, people still get the call, or some of them, and they feel themselves being called to from the transcendent void, and they respond to it by building a model out of beer bottles of somewhere they've never visited, or by erecting a gigantic bat-house in some part of the country that bats have traditionally declined to visit. Roadside attractions: people feel themselves being pulled to places where, in other parts of the world, they would recognize that part of themselves that is truly transcendent, and buy a hot dog and walk around, feeling satisfied on a level they cannot truly describe, and profoundly dissatisfied on a level beneath that.""
""You have some pretty whacked-out theories,"" said Shadow.
""Nothing theoretical about it, young man,"" said Wednesday. ""You should have figured that out by now.""
There was only one ticket window open. ""We stop selling tickets in half an hour,"" said the girl. ""It takes at least two hours to walk around, you see.""
Wednesday paid for their tickets in cash.
""Where's the rock?"" asked Shadow.
""Under the house,"" said Wednesday.
""Where's the house?""
Wednesday put his finger to his lips, and they walked forward. Farther in, a player piano was playing something that was intended to have been Ravel's ""Bolero."" The place seemed to be a geometrically reconfigured 1960s bachelor pad, with open stonework, pile carpeting, and magnificently ugly mushroom-shaped stained glass lampshades. Up a winding staircase was another room, filled with knickknacks.
""They say this was built by Frank Lloyd Wright's evil twin,"" said Wednesday. ""Frank Lloyd Wrong."" He chuckled at his joke.
""I saw that on a T-shirt,"" said Shadow.
Up and down more stairs, and now they were in a long, long room, made of glass, that protruded, needlelike, out over the leafless black-and-white countryside hundreds of feet below them. Shadow stood and watched the snow tumble and spin.
""This is the House on the Rock?"" he asked, puzzled.
""More or less. This is the Infinity Room, part of the actual house, although a late addition. But no, my young friend, we have not scratched the tiniest surface of what the house has to offer.""
""So according to your theory,"" said Shadow, ""Walt Disney World would be the holiest place in America.""
Wednesday frowned, and stroked his beard. ""Walt Disney bought some orange groves in the middle of Florida and built a tourist town on them. No magic there of any kind, although I think there might be something real in the original Disneyland. There may be some power there, although twisted, and hard to access. There's definitely nothing out of the ordinary about Disney World. But some parts of Florida are filled with real magic. You just have to keep your eyes open. Ah, for the mermaids of Weeki Wachee...Follow me, this way.""
Everywhere was the sound of music: jangling, awkward music, ever-so-slightly off the beat and out of time. Wednesday took a five-dollar bill and put it into a change machine, receiving a handful of brass-colored metal coins in return. He tossed one to Shadow, who caught it, and, realizing that a small boy was watching him, held it up between forefinger and thumb and vanished it. The small boy ran over to his mother, who was inspecting one of the ubiquitous Santa Clauses-OVER 6000 ON DISPLAY! the signs said-and he tugged urgently at the hem of her coat.
Shadow followed Wednesday outside briefly, and then followed the signs to the Streets of Yesterday.
""Forty years ago Alex Jordan-his face is on the token you have palmed in your right hand, Shadow-began to build a house on a high jut of rock in a field he did not own, and even he could not have told you why. And people came to see him build it-the curious, and the puzzled, and those who were neither and who could not honestly have told you why they came. So he did what any sensible American male of his generation would do: he began to charge them money-nothing much. A nickel each, perhaps. Or a quarter. And he continued building, and the people kept coming.
""So he took those quarters and nickels and made something even bigger and stranger. He built these warehouses on the land beneath the house, and filled them with things for people to see, and then the people came to see them. Millions of people come here every year.""
""Why?""
But Wednesday simply smiled, and they walked into the dimly lit, tree-lined Streets of Yesterday. Prim-lipped Victorian china dolls stared in profusion through dusty store windows, like so many props from respectable horror films. Cobblestones under their feet, the darkness of a roof above their heads, jangling mechanical music in the background. They passed a glass box of broken puppets, and an overgrown golden music box in a glass case. They passed the dentist's and the drugstore (RESTORE POTENCY! USE O'LEARY'S MAGNETICAL BELT!).
At the end of the street was a large glass box with a female mannequin inside it, dressed as a gypsy fortune-teller.
""Now,"" boomed Wednesday, over the mechanical music, ""at the start of any quest or enterprise it behooves us to consult the Norns. So let us designate this Sybil our Urd, eh?"" He dropped a brass-colored House on the Rock coin into the slot. With jagged, mechanical motions, the gypsy lifted her arm and lowered it once more. A slip of paper chunked out of the slot.
Wednesday took it, read it, grunted, folded it up, and put it in his pocket.
""Aren't you going to show it to me? I'll show you mine,"" said Shadow.
""A man's fortune is his own affair,"" said Wednesday, stiffly. ""I would not ask to see yours.""
Shadow put his own coin in the slot. He took his slip of paper. He read it.
  
EVERY ENDING IS A NEW BEGINNING.
YOUR LUCKY NUMBER IS NONE.
YOUR LUCKY COLOR IS DEAD.
Motto: LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.
  
Shadow made a face. He folded the fortune up and put it in his inside pocket.
They went further in, down a red corridor, past rooms filled with empty chairs upon which rested violins and violas and cellos which played themselves, or seemed to, when fed a coin. Keys depressed, cymbals crashed, pipes blew compressed air into clarinets and oboes. Shadow observed, with a wry amusement, that the bows of the stringed instruments, played by mechanical arms, never actually touched the strings, which were often loose or missing. He wondered whether all the sounds he heard were made by wind and percussion, or whether there were tapes as well.
They had walked for what felt like several miles when they came to a room called the Mikado, one wall of which was a nineteenth-century pseudo-Oriental nightmare, in which beetle-browed mechanical drummers banged cymbals and drums while staring out from their dragon-encrusted lair. Currently, they were majestically torturing Saint-Saëns's ""Danse Macabre.""
Czernobog sat on a bench in the wall facing the Mikado machine, tapping out the time with his fingers. Pipes fluted, bells jangled.
Wednesday sat next to him. Shadow decided to remain standing. Czernobog extended his left hand, shook Wednesday's, shook Shadow's. ""Well met,"" he said. Then he sat back, apparently enjoying the music.
The ""Danse Macabre"" came to a tempestuous and discordant end. That all the artificial instruments were ever-so-slightly out of tune added to the otherworldliness of the place. A new piece began.
""How was your bank robbery?"" asked Czernobog. ""It went well?"" He stood, reluctant to leave the Mikado and its thundering, jangling music.
""Slick as a snake in a barrel of butter,"" said Wednesday.
""I get a pension from the slaughterhouse,"" said Czernobog. ""I do not ask for more.""
""It won't last forever,"" said Wednesday. ""Nothing does.""
More corridors, more musical machines. Shadow became aware that they were not following the path through the rooms intended for tourists, but seemed to be following a different route of Wednesday's own devising. They were going down a slope, and Shadow, confused, wondered if they had already been that way.
Czernobog grasped Shadow's arm. ""Quickly, come here,"" he said, pulling him over to a large glass box by a wall. It contained a diorama of a tramp asleep in a churchyard in front of a church door. THE DRUNKARD'S DREAM said the label, which explained that it was a nineteenth-century penny-in-the-slot machine, originally from an English railway station. The coin slot had been modified to take the brass House on the Rock coins.
""Put in the money,"" said Czernobog.
""Why?"" asked Shadow.
""You must see. I show you.""
Shadow inserted his coin. The drunk in the graveyard raised his bottle to his lips. One of the gravestones flipped over, revealing a grasping corpse; a headstone turned around, flowers replaced by a grinning skull. A wraith appeared on the right of the church, while on the left of the church something with a half-glimpsed pointed, unsettlingly bird-like face, a pale, Boschian nightmare, glided smoothly from a headstone into the shadows and was gone. Then the church door opened, a priest came out, and the ghosts, haunts, and corpses vanished, and only the priest and the drunk were left alone in the graveyard. The priest looked down at the drunk disdainfully, and backed through the open door, which closed behind him, leaving the drunk on his own.
The clockwork story was deeply unsettling. Much more unsettling, thought Shadow, than clockwork has any right to be.
""You know why I show that to you?"" asked Czernobog.
""No.""
""That is the world as it is. That is the real world. It is there, in that box.""
They wandered through a blood-colored room filled with old theatrical organs, huge organ pipes, and what appeared to be enormous copper brewing vats, liberated from a brewery.
""Where are we going?"" asked Shadow.
""The carousel,"" said Czernobog.
""But we've passed signs to the carousel a dozen times already.""
""He goes his way. We travel a spiral. The quickest way is sometimes the longest.""
Shadow's feet were beginning to hurt, and he found this sentiment to be extremely unlikely.
A mechanical machine played ""Octopus's Garden"" in a room that went up for many stories, the center of which was filled entirely with a replica of a great black whale-like beast, with a life-sized replica of a boat in its vast fiberglass mouth. They passed on from there to a Travel Hall, where they saw the car covered with tiles, and the functioning Rube Goldberg chicken device and the rusting Burma Shave ads on the wall.

Life is Hard
It's Toil and Trouble
Keep your Jawline
Free from Stubble

read one, and

He undertook to overtake
The road was on a bend
From now on the Undertaker

and they were at the bottom of a ramp now, with an ice-cream shop in front of them. It was nominally open, but the girl washing down the surfaces had a closed look on her face, so they walked past it into the pizzeria-cafeteria, empty but for an elderly black man wearing a bright check suit and canary-yellow gloves. He was a small man, the kind of little old man who looked as if the passing of the years had shrunk him, eating an enormous, many-scooped ice-cream sundae, drinking a supersized mug of coffee. A black cigarillo was burning in the ashtray in front of him.
""Three coffees,"" said Wednesday to Shadow. He went to the restroom.
Shadow bought the coffees and took them over to Czernobog, who was sitting with the old black man, and was smoking a cigarette surreptitiously, as if he were scared of being caught. The other man, happily toying with his sundae, mostly ignored his cigarillo, but as Shadow approached he picked it up, inhaled deeply, and blew two smoke rings-first one large one, then another, smaller one, which passed neatly through the first-and he grinned, as if he were astonishingly pleased with himself.
""Shadow, this is Mister Nancy,"" said Czernobog.
The old man got to his feet, and thrust out his yellow-gloved right hand. ""Good to meet you,"" he said with a dazzling smile. ""I know who you must be. You're working for the old one-eye bastard, aren't you?"" There was a faint twang in his voice, a hint of a patois that might have been West Indian.
""I work for Mister Wednesday,"" said Shadow. ""Yes. Please, sit down.""
Czernobog inhaled on his cigarette.
""I think,"" he pronounced, gloomily, ""that our kind, we like the cigarettes so much because they remind us of the offerings that once they burned for us, the smoke rising up as they sought our approval or our favor.""
""They never gave me nothin' like that,"" said Nancy. ""Best I could hope for was a pile of fruit to eat, maybe curry goat, something slow and cold and tall to drink, and a big old high-titty woman to keep me company."" He grinned white teeth, and winked at Shadow.
""These days,"" said Czernobog, his expression unchanged, ""we have nothing.""
""Well, I don't get anywhere near as much fruit as I used to,"" said Mr. Nancy, his eyes shining. ""But there still ain't nothing out there in the world for my money that can beat a big old high-titty woman. Some folk you talk to, they say it's the booty you got to inspect at first, but I'm here to tell you that it's the titties that still crank my engine on a cold morning."" Nancy began to laugh, a wheezing, rattling, good-natured laugh, and Shadow found himself liking the old man despite himself.
Wednesday returned from the restroom, and shook hands with Nancy. ""Shadow, you want something to eat? A slice of pizza? Or a sandwich?""
""I'm not hungry,"" said Shadow.
""Let me tell you somethin',"" said Mr. Nancy. ""It can be a long time between meals. Someone offers you food, you say yes. I'm no longer young as I was, but I can tell you this, you never say no to the opportunity to piss, to eat, or to get half an hour's shut-eye. You follow me?""
""Yes. But I'm really not hungry.""
""You're a big one,"" said Nancy, staring into Shadow's light-gray eyes with old eyes the color of mahogany, ""a tall drink of water, but I got to tell you, you don't look too bright. I got a son, stupid as a man who bought his stupid at a two-for-one sale, and you remind me of him.""
""If you don't mind, I'll take that as a compliment,"" said Shadow.
""Being called dumb as a man who slept late the mornin' they handed out brains?""
""Being compared to a member of your family.""
Mr. Nancy stubbed out his cigarillo, then he flicked an imaginary speck of ash off his yellow gloves. ""You may not be the worst choice old one-eye could have made, come to that."" He looked up at Wednesday. ""You got any idea how many of us there's goin' to be here tonight?""
""I sent the message out to everyone I could find,"" said Wednesday. ""Obviously not everyone is going to be able to come. And some of them,"" he said with a pointed look at Czernobog, ""might not want to. But I think we can confidently expect several dozen of us. And the word will travel.""
They made their way past a display of suits of armor (""Victorian fake,"" pronounced Wednesday as they passed the glassed-in display, ""modern fake, twelfth-century helm on a seventeenth-century reproduction, fifteenth-century left gauntlet..."") and then Wednesday pushed through an exit door, circled them around the outside of the building (""I can't be doin' with all these ins and outs,"" said Nancy, ""I'm not as young as I used to be, and I come from warmer climes,"") along a covered walk-way, in through another exit door, and they were in the Carousel room.
Calliope music played: a Strauss waltz, stirring and occasionally discordant. The wall as they entered was hung with antique carousel horses, hundreds of them, some in need of a lick of paint, others in need of a good dusting; above them hung dozens of winged angels constructed rather obviously from female store window mannequins; some of them bared their sexless breasts; some had lost their wigs and stared baldly and blindly down from the darkness.
And then there was the Carousel.
A sign proclaimed it was the largest in the world, said how much it weighed, how many thousand light bulbs were to be found in the chandeliers that hung from it in gothic profusion, and forbade anyone from climbing on it or from riding on the animals.
And such animals! Shadow stared, impressed in spite of himself, at the hundreds of full-sized creatures who circled on the platform of the carousel. Real creatures, imaginary creatures, and transformations of the two: each creature was different-he saw mermaid and merman, centaur and unicorn, elephants (one huge, one tiny), bulldog, frog and phoenix, zebra, tiger, manticore and basilisk, swans pulling a carriage, a white ox, a fox, twin walruses, even a sea serpent, all of them brightly colored and more than real: each rode the platform as the waltz came to an end and a new waltz began. The carousel did not even slow down.
""What's it for?"" asked Shadow. ""I mean, okay, world's biggest, hundreds of animals, thousands of light bulbs, and it goes around all the time, and no one ever rides it.""
""It's not there to be ridden, not by people,"" said Wednesday. ""It's there to be admired. It's there to be.""
""Like a prayer wheel goin' round and round,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""Accumulating power.""
""So where are we meeting everyone?"" asked Shadow. ""I thought you said that we were meeting them here. But the place is empty.""
Wednesday grinned his scary grin. ""Shadow,"" he said. ""You're asking too many questions. You're paid not to ask questions.""
""Sorry.""
""Now, stand over here and help us up,"" said Wednesday, and he walked over to the platform on one side, with a description of the Carousel on it, and a warning that the Carousel was not to be ridden.
Shadow thought of saying something, but instead he helped them, one by one, up onto the ledge. Wednesday seemed profoundly heavy, Czernobog climbed up himself, only using Shadow's shoulder to steady himself, Nancy seemed to weigh nothing at all. Each of the old men climbed out onto the ledge, and then, with a step and a hop, they walked out onto the circling Carousel platform.
""Well?"" barked Wednesday. ""Aren't you coming?""
Shadow, not without a certain amount of hesitation, and a hasty look around for any House on the Rock personnel who might be watching, swung himself up onto the ledge beside the World's Largest Carousel. Shadow was puzzled to realize that he was far more concerned with breaking the rules by climbing onto the Carousel than he had been aiding and abetting this afternoon's bank robbery.
Each of the old men selected a mount. Wednesday climbed onto a golden wolf. Czernobog climbed onto an armored centaur, its face hidden by a metal helmet. Nancy, chuckling, slithered up onto the back of an enormous, leaping lion, captured by the sculptor mid-roar. He patted the side of the lion. The Strauss waltz carried them around, majestically.
Wednesday was smiling, and Nancy was laughing delightedly, an old man's cackle, and even the dour Czernobog seemed to be enjoying himself. Shadow felt as if a weight were suddenly lifted from his back: three old men were enjoying themselves, riding the world's biggest carousel. So what if they did all get thrown out of the place? Wasn't it worth it, worth anything, to say that you had ridden on the World's Largest Carousel? Wasn't it worth it to have traveled on one of those glorious monsters?
Shadow inspected a bulldog, and a mer-creature, and an elephant with a golden howdah, and then he climbed on the back of a creature with an eagle's head and the body of a tiger, and held on tight.
The rhythm of the ""Blue Danube"" waltz rippled and rang and sang in his head, the lights of a thousand chandeliers glinted and prismed, and for a heartbeat Shadow was a child again, and all it took to make him happy was to ride the Carousel: he stayed perfectly still, riding his eagle-tiger at the center of everything, and the world revolved around him.
Shadow heard himself laugh, over the sound of the music. He was happy. It was as if the last thirty-six hours had never happened, as if the last three years had not happened, as if his life had evaporated into the daydream of a small child, riding the carousel in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, on his first trip back to the States, a marathon journey by ship and by car, his mother standing there, watching him proudly, and himself sucking his melting Popsicle, holding on tightly, hoping that the music would never stop, the carousel would never slow, the ride would never end. He was going around and around and around again...
Then the lights went out, and Shadow saw the gods.
AG_ch6	AG	American Gods	6	7752	42196	CHAPTER SIX 

Wide open and unguarded stand our gates,
And through them passes a wild motley throng.
Men from Volga and Tartar steppes.
Featureless figures from the Hoang-ho,
Malayan, Scythian, Teuton, Kelt and Slav,
Flying the Old World's poverty and scorn;
These bringing with them unknown gods and rites,
Those tiger passions here to stretch their claws,
In street and alley what strange tongues are these,
Accents of menace in our ear,
Voices that once the Tower of Babel knew. 
-THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH, ""UNGUARDED GATES,"" 1882 
One moment Shadow was riding the World's Largest Carousel, holding on to his eagle-headed tiger, and then the red and white lights of the Carousel stretched and shivered and went out, and he was falling through an ocean of stars, while the mechanical waltz was replaced by a pounding rhythmic roll and crash, as of cymbals or the breakers on the shores of a far ocean.
The only light was starlight, but it illuminated everything with a cold clarity. Beneath him his mount stretched, and padded, its warm fur under his left hand, its feathers beneath his right.
""It's a good ride, isn't it?"" The voice came from behind him, in its ears and in his mind.
Shadow turned, slowly, streaming images of himself as he moved, frozen moments, each him captured in a fraction of a second, every tiny movement lasting for an infinite period. The images that reached his mind made no sense: it was like seeing the world through the multifaceted jeweled eyes of a dragonfly, but each facet saw something completely different, and he was unable to combine the things he was seeing, or thought he was seeing, into a whole that made any sense.
He was looking at Mr. Nancy, an old black man with a pencil moustache, in his check sports jacket and his lemon-yellow gloves, riding a carousel lion as it rose and lowered, high in the air; and, at the same time, in the same place, he saw a jeweled spider as high as a horse, its eyes an emerald nebula, strutting, staring down at him; and simultaneously he was looking at an extraordinarily tall man with teak-colored skin and three sets of arms, wearing a flowing ostrich-feather headdress, his face painted with red stripes, riding an irritated golden lion, two of his six hands holding on tightly to the beast's mane; and he was also seeing a young black boy, dressed in rags, his left foot all swollen and crawling with black flies; and last of all, and behind all these things, Shadow was looking at a tiny brown spider, hiding under a withered ochre leaf.
Shadow saw all these things, and he knew they were the same thing.
""If you don't close your mouth,"" said the many things that were Mr. Nancy, ""somethin's goin' to fly in there.""
Shadow closed his mouth and swallowed, hard.
There was a wooden hall on a hill, a mile or so from them. They were trotting toward the hall, their mounts' hooves and feet padding noiselessly on the dry sand at the sea's edge.
Czernobog trotted up on his centaur. He tapped the human arm of his mount. ""None of this is truly happening,"" he said to Shadow. He sounded miserable. ""Is all in your head. Best not to think of it.""
Shadow saw a gray-haired old east-European immigrant, with a shabby raincoat and one iron-colored tooth, true. But he also saw a squat black thing, darker than the darkness that surrounded them, its eyes two burning coals; and he saw a prince, with long flowing black hair, and long black moustaches, blood on his hands and his face, riding, naked but for a bearskin over his shoulder, on a creature half-man, half-beast, its face and torso blue-tattooed with swirls and spirals.
""Who are you?"" asked Shadow. ""What are you?""
Their mounts padded along the shore. Waves broke and crashed implacably on the night beach.
Wednesday guided his wolf-now a huge and charcoal-gray beast with green eyes-over to Shadow. Shadow's mount caracoled away from it, and Shadow stroked its neck and told it not to be afraid. Its tiger tail swished, aggressively. It occurred to Shadow that there was another wolf, a twin to the one that Wednesday was riding, keeping pace with them in the sand dunes, just a moment out of sight.
""Do you know me, Shadow?"" said Wednesday. He rode his wolf with his head high. His right eye glittered and flashed, his left eye was dull. He wore a cloak, with a deep, monk-like cowl, and his face stared out at them from the shadows. ""I told you I would tell you my names. This is what they call me. I am called Glad-of-War, Grim, Raider, and Third. I am One-eyed. I am called Highest, and True-Guesser. I am Grimnir, and I am the Hooded One. I am All-Father, and I am Gondlir Wand-bearer. I have as many names as there are winds, as many titles as there are ways to die. My ravens are Huginn and Muninn: Thought and Memory; my wolves are Freki and Geri; my horse is the gallows."" Two ghostly-gray ravens, like transparent skins of birds, landed on Wednesday's shoulders, pushed their beaks into the side of Wednesday's head as if tasting his mind, and flapped out into the world once more.
What should I believe? thought Shadow, and the voice came back to him from somewhere deep beneath the world, in a bass rumble: Believe everything.
""Odin?"" said Shadow, and the wind whipped the word from his lips.
""Odin,"" whispered Wednesday, and the crash of the breakers on the beach of skulls was not loud enough to drown that whisper. ""Odin,"" said Wednesday, tasting the sound of the words in his mouth. ""Odin,"" said Wednesday, his voice a triumphant shout that echoed from horizon to horizon. His name swelled and grew and filled the world like the pounding of blood in Shadow's ears.
And then, as in a dream, they were no longer riding toward a distant hall. They were already there, and their mounts were tied in the shelter beside the hall.
The hall was huge but primitive. The roof was thatched, the walls were wooden. There was a fire burning in the center of the hall, and the smoke stung Shadow's eyes.
""We should have done this in my mind, not in his,"" muttered Mr. Nancy to Shadow. ""It would have been warmer there.""
""We're in his mind?""
""More or less. This is Valaskjalf. It's his old hall.""
Shadow was relieved to see that Nancy was now once more an old man wearing yellow gloves, although his shadow shook and shivered and changed in the flames of the fire, and what it changed into was not always entirely human.
There were wooden benches against the walls, and, sitting on them or standing beside them, perhaps ten people. They kept their distance from each other: a mixed lot, who included a dark-skinned, matronly woman in a red sari, several shabby-looking businessmen, and others, too close to the fire for Shadow to be able to make them out.
""Where are they?"" whispered Wednesday fiercely, to Nancy. ""Well? Where are they? There should be scores of us here. Dozens!""
""You did all the inviting,"" said Nancy. ""I think it's a wonder you got as many here as you did. You think I should tell a story, to start things off?""
Wednesday shook his head. ""Out of the question.""
""They don't look very friendly,"" said Nancy. ""A story's a good way of gettin' someone on your side. And you don't have a bard to sing to them.""
""No stories,"" said Wednesday. ""Not now. Later, there will be time for stories. Not now.""
""No stories. Right. I'll just be the warm-up man."" And Mr. Nancy strode out into the firelight with an easy smile.
""I know what you are all thinking,"" he said. ""You are thinking, what is Compé Anansi doing, coming out to talk to you all, when the All-Father called you all here, just like he called me here? Well, you know, sometimes people need reminding of things. I look around when I come in, and I thought, Where's the rest of us? But then I thought, just because we are few and they are many, we are weak, and they are powerful, it does not mean that we are lost.
""You know, one time I saw Tiger down at the waterhole: he had the biggest testicles of any animal, and the sharpest claws, and two front teeth as long as knives and as sharp as blades. And I said to him, 'Brother Tiger, you go for a swim, I'll look after your balls for you.' He was so proud of his balls. So he got into the waterhole for a swim, and I put his balls on, and left him my own little spider-balls. And then, you know what I did? I ran away, fast as my legs would take me.
""I didn't stop till I got to the next town. And I saw Old Monkey there. 'You lookin' mighty fine, Anansi,' said Old Monkey. I said to him, 'You know what they all singin' in the town over there?' 'What are they singin'?' he asks me. 'They singin' the funniest song,' I told him. Then I did a dance, and I sings,

Tiger's balls, yeah,
I ate Tiger's balls
Now ain't nobody gonna stop me ever at all
Nobody put me up against the big black wall
Cos I ate that Tiger's testimonials
I ate Tiger's balls.
 
""Old Monkey he laughs fit to bust, holding his side and shakin', and stampin', then he starts singin', 'Tiger's Balls, I ate tiger's balls,' snappin' his fingers, spinnin' around on his two feet. 'That's a fine song,' he says, 'I'm going to sing it to all my friends.' 'You do that,' I tell him, and I head back to the watering hole.
""There's Tiger, down by the watering hole, walking up and down, with his tail switchin' and swishin' and his ears and the fur on his neck up as far as they can go, and he's snappin' at every insect comes by with his huge old saber-teeth, and his eyes flashin' orange fire. He looks mean and scary and big, but danglin' between his legs, there's the littlest balls in the littlest blackest most wrinkledy ball-sack you ever did see.
""'Hey, Anansi,' he says, when he sees me. 'You were supposed to be guarding my balls while I went swimming. But when I got out of the swimming hole, there was nothing on the side of the bank but these little black shriveled-up good-for-nothing spider balls I'm wearing.'
""'I done my best,' I tells him, 'but it was those monkeys, they come by and eat your balls all up, and when I tell them off, then they pulled off my own little balls. And I was so ashamed I ran away.'
""'You a liar, Anansi,' says Tiger. 'I'm going to eat your liver.' But then he hears the monkeys coming from their town to the watering hole. A dozen happy monkeys, boppin' down the path, clickin' their fingers and singin' as loud as they could sing,

Tiger's balls, yeah,
I ate Tiger's balls
Now ain't nobody gonna stop me ever at all
Nobody put me up against the big black wall
Cos I ate that Tiger's testimonials
I ate Tiger's balls.
 
""And Tiger, he growls, and he roars and he's off into the forest after them, and the monkeys screech and head for the highest trees. And I scratch my nice new big balls, and damn they felt good hangin' between my skinny legs, and I walk on home. And even today, Tiger keeps chasin' monkeys. So you all remember: just because you're small, doesn't mean you got no power.""
Mr. Nancy smiled, and bowed his head, and spread his hands, accepting the applause and laughter like a pro, and then he turned and walked back to where Shadow and Czernobog were standing.
""I thought I said no stories,"" said Wednesday.
""You call that a story?"" said Nancy. ""I barely cleared my throat. Just warmed them up for you. Go knock them dead.""
Wednesday walked out into the firelight, a big old man with a glass eye in a brown suit and an old Armani coat. He stood there, looking at the people on the wooden benches, saying nothing for longer than Shadow could believe someone could comfortably say nothing. And, finally, he spoke.
""You know me,"" he said. ""You all know me. Some of you have no cause to love me, and I'm not sure I can blame you for that, but love me or not, you know me.""
There was a rustling, a stir among the people on the benches.
""I've been here longer than most of you. Like the rest of you, I figured we could get by on what we got. Not enough to make us happy, but enough to keep going.
""That may not be the case any more. There's a storm coming, and it's not a storm of our making.""
He paused. Now he stepped forward, and folded his arms across his chest.
""When the people came to America they brought us with them. They brought me, and Loki and Thor, Anansi and the Lion-God, Leprechauns and Cluracans and Banshees, Kubera and Frau Holle and Ashtaroth, and they brought you. We rode here in their minds, and we took root. We traveled with the settlers to the new lands across the ocean.
""The land is vast. Soon enough, our people abandoned us, remembered us only as creatures of the old land, as things that had not come with them to the new. Our true believers passed on, or stopped believing, and we were left, lost and scared and dispossessed, to get by on what little smidgens of worship or belief we could find. And to get by as best we could.
""So that's what we've done, gotten by, out on the edges of things, where no one was watching us too closely.
""We have, let us face it and admit it, little influence. We prey on them, and we take from them, and we get by; we strip and we whore and we drink too much; we pump gas and we steal and we cheat and we exist in the cracks at the edges of society. Old gods, here in this new land without gods.""
Wednesday paused. He looked from one to another of his listeners, grave and statesmanlike. They stared back at him impassively, their faces masklike and unreadable. Wednesday cleared his throat, and he spat, hard, into the fire. It flared and flamed, illuminating the inside of the hall.
""Now, as all of you will have had reason aplenty to discover for yourselves, there are new gods growing in America, clinging to growing knots of belief: gods of credit-card and freeway, of internet and telephone, of radio and hospital and television, gods of plastic and of beeper and of neon. Proud gods, fat and foolish creatures, puffed up with their own newness and importance.
""They are aware of us, and they fear us, and they hate us,"" said Odin. ""You are fooling yourselves if you believe otherwise. They will destroy us, if they can. It is time for us to band together. It is time for us to act.""
The old woman in the red sari stepped into the firelight. On her forehead was a small dark blue jewel. She said, ""You called us here for this nonsense?"" And then she snorted, a snort of mingled amusement and irritation.
Wednesday's brows lowered. ""I called you here, yes. But this is sense, Mama-ji, not nonsense. Even a child could see that.""
""So I am a child, am I?"" She wagged a finger at him. ""I was old in Kalighat before you were dreamed of, you foolish man. I am a child? Then I am a child, for there is nothing in your foolish talk to see.""
Again, a moment of double-vision: Shadow saw the old woman, her dark face pinched with age and disapproval, but behind her he saw something huge, a naked woman with skin as black as a new leather jacket, and lips and tongue the bright red of arterial blood. Around her neck were skulls, and her many hands held knives, and swords, and severed heads.
""I did not call you a child, Mama-ji,"" said Wednesday, peaceably. ""But it seems self-evident-""
""The only thing that seems self-evident,"" said the old woman, pointing (as behind her, through her, above her, a black finger, sharp-taloned, pointed in echo), ""is your own desire for glory. We've lived in peace in this country for a long time. Some of us do better than others, I agree. I do well. Back in India, there is an incarnation of me who does much better, but so be it. I am not envious. I've watched the new ones rise, and I've watched them fall again."" Her hand fell to her side. Shadow saw that the others were looking at her, a mixture of expressions-respect, amusement, embarrassment-in their eyes. ""They worshiped the railroads here, only a blink of an eye ago. And now the iron gods are as forgotten as the emerald hunters...""
""Make your point, Mama-ji,"" said Wednesday.
""My point?"" Her nostrils flared. The corners of her mouth turned down. ""I-and I am obviously only a child-say that we wait. We do nothing. We don't know that they mean us harm.""
""And will you still counsel waiting when they come in the night and they kill you, or they take you away?""
Her expression was disdainful and amused: it was all in the lips and the eyebrows and the set of the nose. ""If they try such a thing,"" she said, ""they will find me hard to catch, and harder still to kill.""
A squat young man sitting on the bench behind her harrumphed for attention, then said, with a booming voice, ""All-Father, my people are comfortable. We make the best of what we have. If this war of yours goes against us, we could lose everything.""
Wednesday said, ""You have already lost everything. I am offering you the chance to take something back.""
The fire blazed high as he spoke, illuminating the faces of the audience.
I don't really believe, Shadow thought. I don't believe any of this. Maybe I'm still fifteen. Mom's still alive and I haven't even met Laura yet. Everything that's happened so far has been some kind of especially vivid dream. And yet he could not believe that either. All we have to believe with is our senses: the tools we use to perceive the world, our sight, our touch, our memory. If they lie to us, then nothing can be trusted. And even if we do not believe, then still we cannot travel in any other way than the road our senses show us; and we must walk that road to the end.
Then the fire burned out, and there was darkness in Valaskjalf, Odin's Hall.
""Now what?"" whispered Shadow.
""Now we go back to the Carousel room,"" muttered Mr. Nancy, ""and old One-Eye buys us all dinner, greases some palms, kisses some babies, and no one says the G-word any more.""
""G-word?""
""Gods. What were you doin' the day they handed out brains, boy, anyway?""
""Someone was telling a story about stealing a tiger's balls, and I had to stop and find out how it ended.""
Mr. Nancy chuckled.
""But nothing was resolved. Nobody agreed to anything.""
""He's working them slowly. He'll land 'em one at a time. You'll see. They'll come around in the end.""
Shadow could feel that a wind was coming up from somewhere, stirring his hair, touching his face, pulling at him.
They were standing in the room of the biggest Carousel in the world, listening to ""The Emperor Waltz.""
There was a group of people, tourists by the look of them, talking with Wednesday over at the other side of the room, by the wall covered with all the wooden carousel horses: as many people as there had been shadowy figures in Wednesday's Hall. ""Through here,"" boomed Wednesday, and he led them through the only exit, formed to look like the gaping mouth of a huge monster, its sharp teeth ready to rend them all to slivers. He moved among them like a politician, cajoling, encouraging, smiling, gently disagreeing, pacifying.
""Did that happen?"" asked Shadow.
""Did what happen, shit-for-brains?"" asked Mr. Nancy.
""The hall. The fire. Tiger balls. Riding the Carousel.""
""Heck, nobody's allowed to ride the Carousel. Didn't you see the signs? Now hush.""
The monster's mouth led to the Organ Room, which puzzled Shadow-hadn't they already come through that way? It was no less strange the second time. Wednesday led them all up some stairs, past life-sized models of the four horsemen of the apocalypse hanging from the ceiling, and they followed the signs to an early exit.
Shadow and Nancy brought up the rear. And then they were out of the House on the Rock, walking past the gift store and heading back into the parking lot.
""Pity we had to leave before the end,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""I was kind of hoping to see the biggest artificial orchestra in the whole world.""
""I've seen it,"" said Czernobog. ""It's not so much.""
  
The restaurant was a big and barn-like structure, ten minutes up the road. Wednesday had told each of his guests that tonight's dinner was on him, and had organized rides to the restaurant for any of them that didn't have their own transportation.
Shadow wondered how they had gotten to the House on the Rock without their own transportation, and how they were going to get away again, but he said nothing. It seemed the smartest thing to say.
Shadow had a carful of Wednesday's guests to ferry to the restaurant: the woman in the red sari sat in the front seat beside him. There were two men in the back seat: a peculiar-looking young man whose name Shadow had not properly caught, but thought might be Elvis, and another man, in a dark suit, who Shadow could not remember.
He had stood beside the man as he got into the car, had opened and closed the door for him, and was unable to remember anything about him. He turned around in the driver's seat and looked at him, carefully noting his face, his hair, his clothes, making certain he would know him if he met him again, and turned back to start the car, to find that the man had slipped from his mind. An impression of wealth was left behind, but nothing more.
I'm tired, thought Shadow. He glanced to his right and snuck a glance at the Indian woman. He noted the tiny silver necklace of skulls that circled her neck, her charm bracelet of heads and hands that jangled, like tiny bells, when she moved. There was a dark blue jewel on her forehead. She smelled of spices, of cardamom and nutmeg and flowers. Her hair was pepper-and-salt, and she smiled when she saw him look at her.
""You call me Mama-ji,"" she said.
""I am Shadow, Mama-ji,"" said Shadow.
""And what do you think of your employer's plans, Mister Shadow?""
He slowed, as a large black truck sped past, overtaking them with a spray of slush. ""I don't ask, he don't tell,"" he said.
""If you ask me, he wants a last stand. He wants us to go out in a blaze of glory. That's what he wants. And we are old enough, or stupid enough, that maybe some of us will say yes.""
""It's not my job to ask questions, Mama-ji,"" said Shadow. The inside of the car filled with her tinkling laughter.
The man in the back seat-not the peculiar-looking young man, the other one-said something, and Shadow replied to him, but a moment later he was damned if he could remember what had been said.
The peculiar-looking young man had said nothing, but now he started to hum to himself, a deep, melodic, bass humming that made the interior of the car vibrate and rattle and buzz.
The peculiar-looking man was of average height, but of an odd shape: Shadow had heard of men who were barrel-chested before, but had no image to accompany the metaphor. This man was barrel-chested, and he had legs like, yes, like tree-trunks, and hands like, exactly, ham-hocks. He wore a black parka with a hood, several sweaters, thick dungarees, and, incongruously, in the winter and with those clothes, a pair of white tennis shoes, which were the same size and shape as shoe boxes. His fingers resembled sausages, with flat, squared-off fingertips.
""That's some hum you got,"" said Shadow from the driver's seat.
""Sorry,"" said the peculiar young man, in a deep, deep voice, embarrassed. He stopped humming.
""No, I enjoyed it,"" said Shadow. ""Don't stop.""
The peculiar young man hesitated, then commenced to hum once more, his voice as deep and reverberant as before. This time there were words interspersed in the humming. ""Down down down,"" he sang, so deeply that the windows rattled. ""Down down down, down down, down down.""
Christmas lights were draped across the eaves of every house and building that they drove past. They ranged from discreet golden lights that dripped twinkles to giant displays of snowmen and teddy bears and multicolored stars.
Shadow pulled up at the restaurant and he let his passengers off by the front door, then he got back into the car. He would park it at the back of the parking lot. He wanted to make the short walk back to the restaurant on his own, in the cold, to clear his head.
He parked the car beside a black truck. He wondered if it was the same one that had sped past him earlier.
He closed the car door, and stood there in the parking lot, his breath steaming.
Inside the restaurant, Shadow could imagine Wednesday already sitting all his guests down around a big table, working the room. Shadow wondered whether he had really had Kali in the front of his car, wondered what he had been driving in the back...
""Hey, bud, you got a match?"" said a voice that was half-familiar, and Shadow turned to apologize and say no, he didn't have a match, but the gun barrel hit him over the left eye, and he started to fall. He put out an arm to steady himself as he went down. Someone pushed something soft into his mouth, to stop him crying out, and taped it into position: easy, practiced moves, like a butcher gutting a chicken.
Shadow tried to shout, to warn Wednesday, to warn them all, but nothing came out of his mouth but a muffled noise.
""The quarry are all inside,"" said the half-familiar voice. ""Everyone in position?"" A crackle of a voice, half-audible through a radio. ""Let's move in and round them all up.""
""What about the big guy?"" said another voice.
""Package him up, take him out,"" said the first voice.
They put a bag-like hood over Shadow's head, and bound his wrists and ankles with tape, and put him in the back of a truck, and drove him away.
  
There were no windows in the tiny room in which they had locked Shadow. There was a plastic chair, a lightweight folding table, and a bucket with a cover on it, which served Shadow as a makeshift toilet. There was also a six-foot-long strip of yellow foam on the floor, and a thin blanket with a long-since-crusted brown stain in the center: blood or shit or food, Shadow didn't know and didn't care to investigate. There was a naked bulb behind a metal grille high in the room, but no light switch that Shadow had been able to find. The light was always on. There was no door handle on his side of the door.
He was hungry.
The first thing he had done, when the spooks had pushed him into the room, after they'd ripped off the tape from his ankles and wrists and mouth and left him alone, was to walk around the room and inspect it, carefully. He tapped the walls. They sounded dully metallic. There was a small ventilation grid at the top of the room. The door was soundly locked.
He was bleeding above the left eyebrow in a slow ooze. His head ached.
The floor was uncarpeted. He tapped it. It was made of the same metal as the walls.
He took the top off the bucket, pissed in it, and covered it once more. According to his watch only four hours had passed since the raid on the restaurant.
His wallet was gone, but they had left him his coins.
He sat on the chair, at the card-table. The table was covered with a cigarette-burned green baize. Shadow practiced appearing to push coins through the table. Then he took two quarters and made up a Pointless Coin Trick.
He concealed a quarter in his right palm, and openly displayed the other quarter in his left hand, between finger and thumb. Then he appeared to take the quarter from his left hand, while actually letting it drop back into his left hand. He opened his right hand to display the quarter that had been there all along.
The thing about coin manipulation was that it took all Shadow's head to do it; or rather, he could not do it if he was angry or upset, so the action of practicing an illusion, even one with no possible use on its own-consider, he had expended an enormous amount of effort and skill to make it appear that he had moved a quarter from one hand to the other, something that it takes no skill whatever to do for real-calmed him, cleared his mind of turmoil and fear.
He began a trick even more pointless: a one-handed half-dollar-to-penny transformation, but with his two quarters. Each of the coins was alternately concealed and revealed as the trick progressed: he began with one quarter visible, held between the tips of his forefingers, the other hidden horizontally in the fork of his thumb, a Downs palm. He raised his hand to his mouth and blew on the coin, while slipping the visible quarter onto the tip of his third finger and pushing it into a classic palm, as the first two fingers took the hidden quarter out of the Downs palm and presented it. The effect was that he displayed a quarter in his hand, raised it to his mouth, blew on it, and lowered it again, displaying the same quarter all the while.
He did it over and over and over again.
He wondered if they were going to kill him, and his hand trembled, just a little, and one of the quarters dropped from his fingertip onto the stained green baize of the card table.
And then, because he just couldn't do it any more, he put the coins away, and took out the Liberty-head dollar that Zorya Polunochnaya had given him, and held on to it tightly, and waited.
  
At three in the morning, by his watch, the spooks returned to interrogate him. Two men in dark suits, with dark hair and shiny black shoes. Spooks. One was square-jawed, wide-shouldered, great hair, looked like he had played football in high school, badly bitten fingernails, the other had a receding hairline, silver-rimmed round glasses, manicured nails. While they looked nothing alike, Shadow found himself suspecting that, on some level, possibly cellular, the two men were identical. They stood on each side of the card table, looking down at him.
""How long have you been working for Cargo, sir?"" asked one.
""I don't know what that is,"" said Shadow.
""He calls himself Wednesday. Grimm. Olfather. Old guy. You've been seen with him, sir.""
""I've been working for him for three days.""
""Don't lie to us, sir,"" said the spook with the glasses.
""Okay,"" said Shadow. ""I won't. But it's still three days.""
The clean-jawed spook reached down and twisted Shadow's ear between finger and thumb. He squeezed as he twisted. The pain was intense. ""We told you not to lie to us, sir,"" he said, mildly. Then he let go.
Each of the spooks had a gun-bulge under his jacket. Shadow did not hit the man back. He pretended he was back in prison. Do your own time, thought Shadow. Don't tell them anything they don't know already. Don't ask questions.
""These are dangerous people you're palling around with, sir,"" said the spook with glasses. ""You will be doing your country a service by turning state's evidence."" He smiled, sympathetically: I'm the good cop, said the smile.
""I see,"" said Shadow.
""And if you don't want to help us, sir,"" said the clean-jawed spook, ""you can see what we're like when we're not happy."" He hit Shadow in the stomach again, with his fist. It wasn't torture, Shadow thought, just punctuation: I'm the bad cop. He retched in pain.
""I would like to make you happy,"" said Shadow, as soon as he could speak.
""All we ask is your cooperation, sir.""
""Can I ask..."" gasped Shadow (Don't ask questions, he thought, but it was too late, the words were already spoken), ""can I ask who I'll be cooperating with?""
""You want us to tell you our names?"" asked the clean-jawed spook. ""You have to be out of your mind.""
""No, he's got a point,"" said the spook with glasses. ""It may make it easier for him to relate to us."" He looked at Shadow and smiled like a man advertising toothpaste. ""Hi. I'm Mister Stone, sir. My colleague is Mister Wood.""
""Actually,"" said Shadow, ""I meant, what agency are you with? CIA? FBI?""
Stone shook his head. ""Chee. It's not as easy as that, any more, sir. Things just aren't that simple.""
""The private sector,"" said Wood, ""the public sector. You know. There's a lot of interplay these days.""
""But I can assure you,"" said Stone, with another smiley smile, ""we are the good guys. Are you hungry, sir?"" He reached into a pocket of his jacket, pulled out a Snickers bar. ""Here. A gift.""
""Thanks,"" said Shadow. He unwrapped the Snickers bar and ate it.
""I guess you'd like something to drink with that. Coffee? Beer?""
""Water, please,"" said Shadow.
Stone walked to the door, knocked on it. He said something to the guard on the other side of the door, who nodded and returned a minute later with a polystyrene cup filled with cold water.
""CIA,"" said Wood. He shook his head, ruefully. ""Those bozos. Hey, Stone. I heard a new CIA joke. Okay: how can we be sure the CIA wasn't involved in the Kennedy assassination?""
""I don't know,"" said Stone. ""How can we be sure?""
""He's dead, isn't he?"" said Wood.
They both laughed.
""Feeling better now, sir?"" asked Stone.
""I guess.""
""So why don't you tell us what happened this evening, sir?""
""We did some tourist stuff. Went to the House on the Rock. Went out for some food. You know the rest.""
Stone sighed, heavily. Wood shook his head, as if disappointed, and kicked Shadow in the kneecap. The pain was excruciating. Then Wood pushed a fist slowly into Shadow's back, just above the right kidney, and he twisted his fist, and the pain was worse for Shadow than the pain in his knee.
I'm bigger than either of them, he thought. I can take them. But they were armed; and even if he-somehow-killed or subdued them both, he'd still be locked in the cell with them. (But he'd have a gun. He'd have two guns.) (No.)
Wood was keeping his hands away from Shadow's face. No marks. Nothing permanent: just fists and feet on his torso and knees. It hurt, and Shadow clutched the Liberty dollar tight in the palm of his hand, and waited for it to be over.
And after far too long a time the beating ended.
""We'll see you in a couple of hours, sir,"" said Stone. ""You know, Woody really hated to have to do that. We're reasonable men. Like I said, we are the good guys. You're on the wrong side. Meantime, why don't you try to get a little sleep?""
""You better start taking us seriously,"" said Wood.
""Woody's got a point there, sir,"" said Stone. ""Think about it.""
The door slammed closed behind them. Shadow wondered if they would turn out the light, but they didn't, and it blazed into the room like a cold eye. Shadow crawled across the floor to the yellow foam-rubber pad and climbed onto it, pulling the thin blanket over himself, and he closed his eyes, and he held on to nothing, and he held on to dreams.
Time passed.
He was fifteen again, and his mother was dying, and she was trying to tell him something very important, and he couldn't understand her. He moved in his sleep and a shaft of pain moved him from half-sleep to half-waking, and he winced.
Shadow shivered under the thin blanket. His right arm covered his eyes, blocking out the light of the bulb. He wondered whether Wednesday and the others were still at liberty, if they were even still alive. He hoped that they were.
The silver dollar remained cold in his left hand. He could feel it there, as it had been during the beating. He wondered idly why it did not warm to his body temperature. Half-asleep, now, and half-delirious, the coin, and the idea of Liberty, and the moon, and Zorya Polunochnaya somehow became intertwined in one woven beam of silver light that shone from the depths to the heavens, and he rode the silver beam up and away from the heartache and the fear, away from the pain and, blessedly, back into dreams...
From far away he could hear some kind of noise, but it was too late to think about it: he belonged to sleep now.
A half-thought: he hoped it was not people coming to wake him up, to hit him or to shout at him. And then, he noticed with pleasure, he was really asleep, and no longer cold.
  
Somebody somewhere was shouting for help, in his dream or out of it.
Shadow rolled over on the foam rubber, finding new places that hurt as he rolled, hoping that he had not woken fully and relieved to find sleep was enfolding him once more.
Someone was shaking his shoulder.
He wanted to ask them not to wake him, to let him sleep and leave him be, but it came out as a grunt.
""Puppy?"" said Laura. ""You have to wake up. Please wake up, hon.""
And there was a moment's gentle relief. He had had such a strange dream, of prisons and con-men and down-at-heel gods, and now Laura was waking him to tell him it was time for work, and perhaps there would be time enough before work to steal some coffee and a kiss, or more than a kiss; and he put out his hand to touch her.
Her flesh was cold as ice, and sticky.
Shadow opened his eyes.
""Where did all the blood come from?"" he asked.
""Other people,"" she said. ""It's not mine. I'm filled with formaldehyde, mixed with glycerin and lanolin.""
""Which other people?"" he asked.
""The guards,"" she said. ""It's okay. I killed them. You better move. I don't think I gave anyone a chance to raise the alarm. Take a coat from out there, or you'll freeze your butt off.""
""You killed them?""
She shrugged, and half-smiled, awkwardly. Her hands looked as if she had been finger-painting, composing a picture that had been executed solely in crimsons, and there were splashes and spatters on her face and clothes (the same blue suit in which she had been buried) that made Shadow think of Jackson Pollock, because it was less problematic to think of Jackson Pollock than to accept the alternative.
""It's easier to kill people, when you're dead yourself,"" she told him. ""I mean, it's not such a big deal. You're not so prejudiced any more.""
""It's still a big deal to me,"" said Shadow.
""You want to stay here until the morning crew comes?"" she said. ""You can if you like. I thought you'd like to get out of here.""
""They'll think I did it,"" he said, stupidly.
""Maybe,"" she said. ""Put on a coat, hon. You'll freeze.""
He walked out into the corridor. At the end of the corridor was a guardroom. In the guardroom were four dead men: three guards, and the man who had called himself Stone. His friend was nowhere to be seen. From the blood-colored skid-marks on the floor, two of them had been dragged into the guardroom, and dropped onto the floor.
Shadow's coat was hanging from the coat rack. His wallet was still in the inside pocket, apparently untouched. Laura pulled open a couple of cardboard boxes, filled with candy bars.
The guards, now he could see them properly, were wearing dark camouflage uniforms, but there were no official tags on them, nothing to say for whom they were working. They might have been weekend duck hunters, dressed for the shoot.
Laura reached out her cold hand, and squeezed Shadow's hand in hers. She had the gold coin he had given her around her neck, on a golden chain.
""That looks nice,"" he said.
""Thanks."" She smiled, prettily.
""What about the others?"" he asked. ""Wednesday, and the rest of them? Where are they?"" Laura passed him a handful of candy bars, and he filled his pockets with them.
""There wasn't anybody else here. A lot of empty cells, and one with you in it. Oh, and one of the men had gone into the cell down there to jack off with a magazine. He got such a shock.""
""You killed him while he was jerking himself off?""
She shrugged. ""I guess,"" she said, uncomfortably. ""I was worried they were hurting you. Someone has to watch out for you, and I told you I would, didn't I? Here, take these."" They were chemical hand-and footwarmers: thin pads-you broke the seal and they heated up to a little above body temperature and stayed that way for hours. Shadow pocketed them.
""Look out for me. Yes,"" he said, ""you did.""
She reached out a finger, stroked him above his left eyebrow. ""You're hurt,"" she said.
""I'm okay,"" he said.
He opened a metal door in the wall. It swung open slowly. There was a four-foot drop to the ground, and he swung himself down to what felt like gravel. He picked up Laura by the waist, swung her down, as he used to swing her, easily, without a second thought...
The moon came out from behind a thick cloud. It was low on the horizon, ready to set, but the light it cast onto the snow was enough to see by.
They had emerged from what turned out to be the black-painted metal car of a long freight train, parked or abandoned in a woodland siding. The series of cars went on as far as he could see, into the trees and away. Of course he had been on a train. He should have known.
""How the hell did you find me here?"" he asked his dead wife.
She shook her head slowly, amused. ""You shine like a beacon in a dark world,"" she told him. ""It wasn't that hard. Now,"" she told him, ""you need to go. Just go. Go as far and as fast as you can. Don't use your credit cards and you should be fine.""
""Where should I go?""
She pushed a hand through her matted hair, flicking it back out of her eyes. ""The road's that way,"" she told him. ""Do whatever you can. Steal a car if you have to. Go south.""
""Laura,"" he said, and hesitated. ""Do you know what's going on? Do you know who these people are? Who did you kill?""
""Yeah,"" she said. ""I think I know.""
""I owe you,"" said Shadow. ""I'd still be in there if it wasn't for you. I don't think they had anything good planned for me.""
""No,"" she said. ""I don't think they did.""
They walked away from the empty train cars. Shadow wondered about the other trains he'd seen, blank windowless metal cars which went on for mile after mile hooting their lonely way through the night. His fingers closed around the Liberty dollar in his pocket, and he remembered Zorya Polunochnaya, and the way she had looked at him in the moonlight. Did you ask her what she wanted?...It is the wisest thing to ask the dead. Sometimes they will tell you.
""Laura...What do you want?"" he asked.
""You really want to know?""
""Yes. Please.""
Laura looked up at him with dead blue eyes. ""I want to be alive again,"" she said. ""Not in this half-life. I want to be really alive. I want to feel my heart pumping in my chest again. I want to feel blood moving through me-hot, and salty, and real. It's weird, you don't think you can feel it, the blood, but believe me, when it stops flowing, you'll know."" She rubbed her eyes, smudging her face with red from the mess on her hands. ""Look, I don't know why this happened to me. But it's hard. You know why dead people only go out at night, puppy? Because it's easier to pass for real, in the dark. And I don't want to have to pass. I want to be alive.""
""I don't understand what you want me to do.""
""Make it happen, hon. You'll figure it out. I know you will.""
""Okay,"" he said. ""I'll try. And if I do figure it out, how do I find you?""
But she was gone, and there was nothing left in the woodland but a gentle gray in the sky to show him where east was, and on the bitter December wind a lonely wail that might have been the cry of the last night bird or the call of the first bird of dawn.
Shadow set his face to the south, and he began to walk.
AG_ch6	AG	American Gods	6	5136	27734	CHAPTER SIXTEEN 

I know it's crooked. But it's the only game in town.
-CANADA BILL JONES 
The tree was gone, and the world was gone, and the morning-gray sky above him was gone. The sky was now the color of midnight. There was a single cold star shining high above him, a blazing, twinkling light, and nothing else. He took a single step and almost tripped.
Shadow looked down. There were steps cut into the rock, going down, steps so huge that he could only imagine that giants had cut them and descended them a long time ago.
He clambered downward, half jumping, half vaulting from step to step. His body ached, but it was the ache of lack of use, not the tortured ache of a body that has hung on a tree until it was dead.
He observed, without surprise, that he was now fully dressed, in jeans and a white T-shirt. He was barefoot. He experienced a profound moment of déjà vu: this was what he had been wearing when he stood in Czernobog's apartment the night when Zorya Polunochnaya had come to him and told him about the constellation called Odin's Wain. She had taken the moon down from the sky for him.
He knew, suddenly, what would happen next. Zorya Polunochnaya would be there.
She was waiting for him at the bottom of the steps. There was no moon in the sky, but she was bathed in moonlight nonetheless: her white hair was moon-pale, and she wore the same lace-and-linen nightdress she had worn that night in Chicago.
She smiled when she saw him, and looked down, as if momentarily embarrassed. ""Hello,"" she said.
""Hi,"" said Shadow.
""How are you?""
""I don't know,"" he said. ""I think this is maybe another strange dream on the tree. I've been having crazy dreams since I got out of prison.""
Her face was silvered by the moonlight (but no moon hung in that plum-black sky, and now, at the foot of the steps, even the single star was lost to view) and she looked both solemn and vulnerable. She said, ""All your questions can be answered, if that is what you want. But once you learn your answers, you can never unlearn them. You have to understand that.""
""I got it,"" he said.
Beyond her, the path forked. He would have to decide which path to take, he knew that. But there was one thing he had to do first. He reached into the pocket of his jeans and was relieved when he felt the familiar weight of the coin at the bottom of the pocket. He eased it out, held it between finger and thumb: a 1922 Liberty dollar. ""This is yours,"" he said.
He remembered then that his clothes were really at the foot of the tree. The women had placed his clothes in the canvas sack from which they had taken the ropes, and tied the end of the sack, and the biggest of the women had placed a heavy rock on it to stop it from blowing away. And so he knew that, in reality, the Liberty dollar was in a pocket in that sack, beneath the rock. But still, it was heavy in his hand, at the entrance to the underworld.
She took it from his palm with her slim fingers.
""Thank you. It bought you your liberty twice,"" she said. ""And now it will light your way into dark places.""
She closed her hand around the dollar, then she reached up and placed it in the air, as high as she could reach. She let go of it. Shadow knew, then, that this was another dream, for instead of falling, the coin floated upward until it was a foot or so above Shadow's head. It was no longer a silver coin, though. Lady Liberty and her crown of spikes were gone. The face he saw on the coin was the indeterminate face of the moon in the summer sky, the face that was only visible until you stared at it, whereupon it would become dark seas and shapes on the moon's cratered surface, the pattern and the face replaced by shadows of pure randomness and chance.
Shadow could not decide whether he was looking at a moon the size of a dollar, a foot above his head; or whether he was looking at a moon the size of the Pacific Ocean, many thousands of miles away. Nor whether there was any difference between the two ideas. Perhaps it was all a matter of perspective. Perhaps it was all a matter of point of view.
He looked at the forking path ahead of him.
""Which path should I take?"" he asked. ""Which one is safe?""
""Take one, and you cannot take the other,"" she said. ""But neither path is safe. Which way would you walk-the way of hard truths or the way of fine lies?""
Shadow hesitated. ""Truths,"" he said. ""I've come too far for more lies.""
She looked sad. ""There will be a price,"" she said.
""I'll pay it. What's the price?""
""Your name,"" she said. ""Your real name. You will have to give it to me.""
""How?""
""Like this,"" she said. She reached a perfect hand toward his head. He felt her fingers brush his skin, then he felt them penetrate his skin, his skull, felt them push deep into his head. Something tickled, in his skull and all down his spine. She pulled her hand out of his head. A flame, like a candle-flame but burning with a clear magnesium-white luminance, was flickering on the tip of her forefinger.
""Is that my name?"" he asked.
She closed her hand, and the light was gone. ""It was,"" she said. She extended her hand, and pointed to the right-hand path. ""That way,"" she said. ""For now.""
Nameless, Shadow walked down the right-hand path in the moonlight. When he turned around to thank her, he saw nothing but darkness. It seemed to him that he was deep under the ground, but when he looked up into the darkness above him he still saw the tiny moon.
He turned a corner.
If this was the afterlife, he thought, it was a lot like the House on the Rock: part diorama, part nightmare.
He was looking at himself in prison blues, in the warden's office, as the warden told him that Laura had died in a car crash. He saw the expression on his own face-he looked like a man who had been abandoned by the world. It hurt him to see it, the nakedness and the fear. He hurried on, pushed through the warden's gray office, and found himself looking at the VCR repair store on the outskirts of Eagle Point. Three years ago. Yes.
Inside the store, he knew, he was beating the living crap out of Larry Powers and B. J. West, bruising his knuckles in the process: pretty soon he would walk out of there, carrying a brown supermarket bag filled with twenty-dollar bills. The money they could never prove he had taken: his share of the proceeds, and a little more, for they shouldn't have tried to rip him and Laura off like that. He was only the driver, but he had done his part, done everything that she had asked of him...
At the trial, nobody mentioned the bank robbery, although he was certain everybody wanted to. They couldn't prove a thing, as long as nobody was talking. And nobody was. The prosecutor was forced instead to stick to the bodily damage that Shadow had inflicted on Powers and West. He showed photographs of the two men on their arrival in the local hospital. Shadow barely defended himself in court; it was easier that way. Neither Powers nor West seemed able to remember what the fight had been about, but they each admitted that Shadow had been their assailant.
Nobody talked about the money.
Nobody even mentioned Laura, and that was all that Shadow had wanted.
Shadow wondered whether the path of comforting lies would have been a better one to walk. He walked away from that place, and followed the rock path down into what looked like a hospital room, a public hospital in Chicago, and he felt the bile rise in his throat. He stopped. He did not want to look. He did not want to keep walking.
In the hospital bed his mother was dying again, as she'd died when he was sixteen, and, yes, here he was, a large, clumsy sixteen-year-old with acne pocking his cream-and-coffee skin, sitting at her bedside, unable to look at her, reading a thick paperback book. Shadow wondered what the book was, and he walked around the hospital bed to inspect it more closely. He stood between the bed and the chair looking from the one to the other, the big boy hunched into his chair, his nose buried in Gravity's Rainbow, trying to escape from his mother's death into London during the blitz, the fictional madness of the book no escape and no excuse.
His mother's eyes were closed in a morphine peace: what she had thought was just another sickle-cell crisis, another bout of pain to be endured, had turned out, they had discovered, too late, to be lymphoma. There was a lemonish-gray tinge to her skin. She was in her early thirties, but she looked much older.
Shadow wanted to shake himself, the awkward boy that he once was, get him to hold her hand, talk to her, do something before she slipped away, as he knew that she would. But he could not touch himself, and he continued to read; and so his mother died while he sat in the chair next to her, reading a fat book.
After that he had more or less stopped reading. You could not trust fiction. What good were books, if they couldn't protect you from something like that?
Shadow walked away from the hospital room, down the winding corridor, deep into the bowels of the earth.
He sees his mother first and he cannot believe how young she is, not yet twenty-five he guesses, before her medical discharge and they're in their apartment, another embassy rental somewhere in Northern Europe, he looks around for something to give him a clue, and he's just a shrimp of a kid now, big pale-gray eyes and straight dark hair. They are arguing. Shadow knows without hearing the words what they're arguing about: it was the only thing they quarreled about, after all.
-Tell me about my father.
-He's dead. Don't ask about him.
-But who was he?
-Forget him. Dead and gone and you ain't missed nothing.
-I want to see a picture of him.
-I ain't got a picture, she'd say, and her voice would get quiet and fierce, and he knew that if he kept asking her questions she would shout, or even hit him, and he knew that he could not stop asking questions, so he turned away and walked on down the tunnel.
The path he followed twisted and wound and curled back on itself, and it put him in mind of snakeskins and intestines and of deep, deep tree roots. There was a pool to his left; he heard the drip, drip of water into it somewhere at the back of the tunnel, the falling water barely ruffling the mirrored surface of the pool. He dropped to his knees and drank, using his hand to bring the water to his lips. Then he walked on until he was standing in the floating disco-glitter patterns of a mirror-ball. It was like being in the exact center of the universe with all the stars and planets circling him, and he could not hear anything, not the music, nor the shouted conversations over the music, and now Shadow was staring at a woman who looked just like his mother never looked in all the years he knew her, she's little more than a child, after all...
And she is dancing.
Shadow found that he was completely unsurprised when he recognized the man who dances with her. He had not changed that much in thirty-three years.
She is drunk: Shadow could see that at a glance. She is not very drunk, but she is unused to drink, and in a week or so she will take a ship to Norway. They have been drinking margaritas, and she has salt on her lips and salt clinging to the back of her hand.
Wednesday is not wearing a suit and tie, but the pin in the shape of a silver tree he wears over the pocket of his shirt glitters and glints when the mirror-ball light catches it. He does not dance badly; they make a fine-looking couple, considering the difference in their ages. There is a lupine grace to his movements.
A slow dance. He pulls her close to him, and his paw-like hand curves around the seat of her skirt possessively, moving her closer to him. His other hand takes her chin, pushes it upward into his face, and the two of them kiss, there on the floor, as the glitter-ball lights circle them into the center of the universe.
Soon after, they leave. She sways against him, and he leads her from the dance hall. Shadow buries his head in his hands, and does not follow them, unable or unwilling to witness his own conception.
The mirror lights were gone, and now the only illumination came from the tiny moon that burned high above his head.
He walked on. At a bend in the path he stopped for a moment, to catch his breath.
He felt a hand run gently up his back, and gentle fingers ruffle the hair on the back of his head.
""Hello, hon,"" whispered a smoky female voice, over his shoulder.
""Hello,"" he said, turning to face her.
She had brown hair and brown skin and her eyes were the deep golden-amber of good honey. Her pupils were vertical slits. ""Do I know you?"" he asked, puzzled.
""Intimately,"" she said, and she smiled. ""I used to sleep on your bed. And my people have been keeping their eyes on you, for me."" She turned to the path ahead of him, pointed to the three ways he could go. ""Okay,"" she said. ""One way will make you wise. One way will make you whole. And one way will kill you.""
""I'm already dead, I think,"" said Shadow. ""I died on the tree.""
She made a moue. ""There's dead,"" she said, ""and there's dead, and there's dead. It's a relative thing."" Then she smiled again. ""I could make a joke about that, you know. Something about dead relatives.""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""It's okay.""
""So,"" she said. ""Which way do you want to go?""
""I don't know,"" he admitted.
She tipped her head on one side, a perfectly feline gesture. Suddenly, Shadow knew exactly who she was, and where he knew her from. He felt himself beginning to blush. ""If you trust me,"" said Bast, ""I can choose for you.""
""I trust you,"" he said, without hesitation.
""Do you want to know what it's going to cost you?""
""I've already lost my name,"" he told her.
""Names come and names go. Was it worth it?""
""Yes. Maybe. It wasn't easy. As revelations go, it was kind of personal.""
""All revelations are personal,"" she said. ""That's why all revelations are suspect.""
""I don't understand.""
""No,"" she said, ""you don't. I'll take your heart. We'll need it later,"" and she reached her hand deep inside his chest, and she pulled it out with something ruby and pulsing held between her sharp fingernails. It was the color of pigeon's blood, and it was made of pure light. Rhythmically it expanded and contracted.
She closed her hand, and it was gone.
""Take the middle way,"" she said.
Shadow hesitated. ""Are you really here?"" he asked.
She tipped her head on one side, regarded him gravely, said nothing at all.
""What are you?"" he asked. ""What are you people?""
She yawned, showing a perfect, dark-pink tongue. ""Think of us as symbols-we're the dream that humanity creates to make sense of the shadows on the cave wall. Now go on, keep moving. Your body is already growing cold. The fools are gathering on the mountain. The clock is ticking.""
Shadow nodded, and walked on.
The path was becoming slippery now. There was ice on the rock. Shadow stumbled and skidded as he walked down the rock path, toward the place where it divided, scraping his knuckles on a jut of rock at chest height. He edged forward as slowly as he could. The moon above him glittered through the ice-crystals in the air: there was a ring about the moon, a moonbow, diffusing the light. It was beautiful, but it made walking harder. The path was unreliable.
He reached the place where the path divided.
He looked at the first path with a feeling of recognition. It opened into a vast chamber, or a set of chambers, like a dark museum. He knew it already. He had been there once, although for several moments he was unable to remember where or when. He could hear the long echoes of tiny noises. He could hear the noise that the dust makes as it settles.
It was the place that he had dreamed of, that first night that Laura had come to him, in the motel, so long ago; the endless memorial hall to the gods that were forgotten, and the ones whose very existence had been lost.
He took a step backward.
He walked to the path on the far side, and looked ahead. There was a Disneyland quality to the corridor: black Plexiglas walls with lights set in them. The colored lights blinked and flashed in the illusion of order, for no particular reason, like the console lights on a television starship.
He could hear something there as well: a deep vibrating bass drone which Shadow could feel in the pit of his stomach.
He stopped and looked around. Neither way seemed right. Not any longer. He was done with paths. The middle way, the way the cat-woman had told him to walk, that was his way. He moved toward it.
The moon above him was beginning to fade: the edge of it was pinking and going into eclipse. The path was framed by a huge doorway.
There were no deals to make any more, no more bargains. There was nothing to do but enter. So Shadow walked through the doorway, in darkness. The air was warm, and it smelled of wet dust, like a city street after the summer's first rain.
He was not afraid.
Not any more. Fear had died on the tree, as Shadow had died. There was no fear left, no hatred, no pain. Nothing left but essence.
Something big splashed, quietly, in the distance, and the splash echoed into the vastness. He squinted, but could see nothing. It was too dark. And then, from the direction of the splashes, a ghost-light glimmered and the world took form: he was in a cavern, and in front of him, mirror-smooth, was water.
The splashing noises came closer and the light became brighter, and Shadow waited on the shore. Soon enough a low, flat boat came into sight, a flickering white lantern burning at its raised prow, another reflected in the glassy black water several feet below it. The boat was being poled by a tall figure, and the splashing noise Shadow had heard was the sound of the pole being lifted and moved as it pushed the craft across the waters of the underground lake.
""Hello there!"" called Shadow. Echoes of his words suddenly surrounded him: he could imagine that a whole chorus of people were welcoming him, and calling to him, and each of them had his voice.
The person poling the boat made no reply.
The boat's pilot was tall, and very thin. He-if it was a he-wore an unadorned white robe, and the pale head that topped it was so utterly inhuman that Shadow was certain that it had to be a mask of some sort: it was a bird's head, small on a long neck, its beak long and high. Shadow was certain he had seen it before, this ghostly, bird-like figure. He grasped at the memory and then, disappointed, realized that he was picturing the clockwork penny-in-the-slot machine in the House on the Rock, and the pale, bird-like, half-glimpsed figure that glided out from behind the crypt for the drunkard's soul.
Water dripped and echoed from the pole and the prow, and the ship's wake rippled the glassy waters. The boat was made of reeds, bound and tied.
The boat came close to the shore. The pilot leaned on its pole. Its head turned slowly, until it was facing Shadow. ""Hello,"" it said, without moving its long beak. The voice was male, and, like everything else in Shadow's afterlife so far, familiar. ""Come on board. You'll get your feet wet, I'm afraid, but there's not a thing can be done about that. These are old boats, and if I come in closer I could rip out the bottom.""
Shadow took off the shoes he had not been aware he was wearing, and stepped out into the water. It came halfway up his calves, and was, after the initial shock of wetness, surprisingly warm. He reached the boat, and the pilot put down a hand, and pulled him aboard. The reed boat rocked a little, and water splashed over the low sides of it, and then it steadied.
The pilot poled off away from the shore. Shadow stood there and watched, his pants-legs dripping.
""I know you,"" he said to the creature at the prow.
""You do indeed,"" said the boatman. The oil lamp which hung at the front of the boat burned more fitfully, and the smoke from the lamp made Shadow cough. ""You worked for me. I'm afraid we had to inter Lila Goodchild without you."" The voice was fussy and precise.
The smoke stung Shadow's eyes. He wiped the tears away with his hand, and, through the smoke, he thought he saw a tall man, in a suit, with gold-rimmed spectacles. The smoke cleared and the boatman was once more a half-human creature with the head of a river-bird.
""Mister Ibis?""
""Good to see you, Shadow,"" said the creature, with Mr. Ibis's voice. ""Do you know what a psychopomp is?""
Shadow thought he knew the word, but it had been a long time. He shook his head.
""It's a fancy term for an escort,"" said Mr. Ibis. ""We all have so many functions, so many ways of existing. In my own vision of myself, I am a scholar who lives quietly, and pens his little tales, and dreams about a past that may or may not ever have existed. And that is true, as far as it goes. But I am also, in one of my capacities, like so many of the people you have chosen to associate with, a psychopomp. I escort the living to the world of the dead.""
""I thought this was the world of the dead,"" said Shadow.
""No. Not per se. It's more of a preliminary.""
The boat slipped and slid across the mirror-surface of the underground pool. The bird-head of the creature at the prow stared ahead. And then Mr. Ibis said, without moving its beak, ""You people talk about the living and the dead as if they were two mutually exclusive categories. As if you cannot have a river that is also a road, or a song that is also a color.""
""You can't,"" said Shadow. ""Can you?"" The echoes whispered his words back at him from across the pool.
""What you have to remember,"" said Mr. Ibis, testily, ""is that life and death are different sides of the same coin. Like the heads and tails of a quarter.""
""And if I had a double-headed quarter?""
""You don't. They only belong to fools, and gods.""
Shadow had a frisson, then, as they crossed the dark water. He imagined he could see the faces of children staring up at him reproachfully from beneath the water's glassy surface: their faces were waterlogged and softened, their blind eyes clouded. There was no wind in that underground cavern to disturb the black surface of the lake.
""So I'm dead,"" said Shadow. He was getting used to the idea. ""Or I'm going to be dead.""
""We are on our way to the Hall of the Dead. I requested that I be the one to come for you.""
""Why?""
""I'm a psychopomp. I like you. You were a hard worker. Why not?""
""Because..."" Shadow marshaled his thoughts. ""Because I never believed in you. Because I don't know much about Egyptian mythology. Because I didn't expect this. What happened to Saint Peter and the Pearly Gates?""
The long-beaked white head shook from side to side, gravely. ""It doesn't matter that you didn't believe in us,"" said Mr. Ibis. ""We believed in you.""
The boat touched bottom. Mr. Ibis stepped off the side, into the pool, and told Shadow to do the same. Mr. Ibis took a line from the prow of the boat, and passed Shadow the lantern to carry. It was in the shape of a crescent moon. They walked ashore, and Mr. Ibis tied the boat to a metal ring set in the rock floor. Then he took the lamp from Shadow and walked swiftly forward, holding the lamp high as he walked, throwing vast shadows across the rock floor and the high rock walls.
""Are you scared?"" asked Mr. Ibis.
""Not really.""
""Well, try to cultivate the emotions of true awe and spiritual terror, as we walk. They are the appropriate feelings for the situation at hand.""
Shadow was not scared. He was interested, and apprehensive, but no more. He was not scared of the shifting darkness, nor of being dead, nor even of the dog-headed creature the size of a grain silo who stared at them as they approached. It growled, deep in its throat, and Shadow felt his neck-hairs prickle.
""Shadow,"" it said. ""Now is the time of judgment.""
Shadow looked up at the creature. ""Mister Jacquel?"" he said.
The hands of Anubis came down, huge dark hands, and they picked Shadow up and brought him close.
The jackal head examined him with bright and glittering eyes; examined him as dispassionately as Mr. Jacquel had examined the dead girl on the slab. Shadow knew that all his faults, all his failings, all his weaknesses were being taken out and weighed and measured; that he was, in some way, being dissected, and sliced, and tasted.
We do not always remember the things that do no credit to us. We justify them, cover them in bright lies or with the thick dust of forgetfulness. All of the things that Shadow had done in his life of which he was not proud, all the things he wished he had done otherwise or left undone, came at him then in a swirling storm of guilt and regret and shame, and he had nowhere to hide from them. He was as naked and as open as a corpse on a table, and dark Anubis the jackal god was his prosector and his prosecutor and his persecutor.
""Please,"" said Shadow. ""Please stop.""
But the examination did not stop. Every lie he had ever told, every object he had stolen, every hurt he had inflicted on another person, all the little crimes and the tiny murders that make up the day, each of these things and more were extracted and held up to the light by the jackal-headed judge of the dead.
Shadow began to weep, painfully, in the palm of the dark god's hand. He was a tiny child again, as helpless and as powerless as he had ever been.
And then, without warning, it was over. Shadow panted, and sobbed, and snot streamed from his nose; he still felt helpless, but the hands placed him, carefully, almost tenderly, down on the rock floor.
""Who has his heart?"" growled Anubis.
""I do,"" purred a woman's voice. Shadow looked up. Bast was standing there beside the thing that was no longer Mr. Ibis, and she held Shadow's heart in her right hand. It lit her face with a ruby light.
""Give it to me,"" said Thoth, the ibis-headed god, and he took the heart in his hands, which were not human hands, and he glided forward.
Anubis placed a pair of golden scales in front of him.
""So is this where we find out what I get?"" whispered Shadow to Bast. ""Heaven? Hell? Purgatory?""
""If the feather balances,"" she said, ""you get to choose your own destination.""
""And if not?""
She shrugged, as if the subject made her uncomfortable. Then she said, ""Then we feed your heart and your soul to Ammet, the Eater of Souls...""
""Maybe,"" he said. ""Maybe I can get some kind of a happy ending.""
""Not only are there no happy endings,"" she told him. ""There aren't even any endings.""
On one of the pans of the scales, carefully, reverently, Anubis placed a feather.
Anubis put Shadow's heart on the other pan of the scales. Something moved in the shadows under the scale, something it made Shadow uncomfortable to examine too closely.
It was a heavy feather, but Shadow had a heavy heart, and the scales tipped and swung worryingly.
But they balanced, in the end, and the creature in the shadows skulked away, unsatisfied.
""So that's that,"" said Bast, wistfully. ""Just another skull for the pile. It's a pity. I had hoped that you would do some good, in the current troubles. It's like watching a slow-motion car crash and being powerless to prevent it.""
""You won't be there?""
She shook her head. ""I don't like other people picking my battles for me,"" she said.
There was silence then, in the vasty hall of death, where it echoed of water and the dark.
Shadow said, ""So now I get to choose where I go next?""
""Choose,"" said Thoth. ""Or we can choose for you.""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""It's okay. It's my choice.""
""Well?"" roared Anubis.
""I want to rest now,"" said Shadow. ""That's what I want. I want nothing. No heaven, no hell, no anything. Just let it end.""
""You're certain?"" asked Thoth.
""Yes,"" said Shadow.
Mr. Jacquel opened the last door for Shadow, and behind that door there was nothing. Not darkness. Not even oblivion. Only nothing.
Shadow accepted it, completely and without reservation, and he walked through the door into nothing with a strange fierce joy.
AG_ch7	AG	American Gods	7	12000	65924	CHAPTER SEVEN 

As the Hindu gods are ""immortal"" only in a very particular sense-for they are born and they die-they experience most of the great human dilemmas and often seem to differ from mortals in a few trivial details...and from demons even less. Yet they are regarded by the Hindus as a class of beings by definition totally different from any other; they are symbols in a way that no human being, however ""archetypal"" his life story, can ever be. They are actors playing parts that are real only for us; they are the masks behind which we see our own faces.
-WENDY DONIGER O'FLAHERTY, INTRODUCTION,HINDU MYTHS (PENGUIN BOOKS, 1975) 
Shadow had been walking south, or what he hoped was more or less south, for several hours, heading along a narrow and unmarked road through the woods somewhere in, he imagined, southern Wisconsin. Several jeeps came down the road toward him at one point, headlights blazing, and he ducked well back into the trees until they had passed. The early morning mist hung at waist level. The cars were black.
When, thirty minutes later, he heard the noise of distant helicopters coming from the west, he struck out away from the timber trail and into the woods. There were two helicopters, and he lay, crouched in a hollow beneath a fallen tree, and listened to them pass over. As they moved away, he looked out and looked up, for one hasty glance at the gray winter sky. He was satisfied to observe that the helicopters were painted a matte black. He waited beneath the tree until the noise of the helicopters was completely gone.
Under the trees the snow was little more than a dusting, which crunched underfoot. He was deeply grateful for the chemical hand- and feetwarmers, which kept his extremities from freezing. Beyond that, he was numb: heart-numb, mind-numb, soul-numb. And the numbness, he realized, went a long way down, and a long way back.
So what do I want? he asked himself. He couldn't answer, so he just kept on walking, a step at a time, on and on through the woods. Trees looked familiar, moments of landscape were perfectly déjà-vued. Could he be walking in circles? Maybe he would just walk and walk and walk until the warmers and the candy bars ran out and then sit down and never get up again.
He reached a large stream, of the kind the locals called a creek and pronounced crick, and decided to follow it. Streams led to rivers, rivers all led to the Mississippi, and if he kept walking, or stole a boat or built a raft, eventually he'd get to New Orleans, where it was warm, an idea which seemed both comforting and unlikely.
There were no more helicopters. He had the feeling that the ones that had passed overhead had been cleaning up the mess at the freight train siding, not hunting for him, otherwise they would have returned; there would have been tracker dogs and sirens and the whole paraphernalia of pursuit. Instead, there was nothing.
What did he want? Not to get caught. Not to get blamed for the deaths of the men on the train. ""It wasn't me,"" he heard himself saying, ""it was my dead wife."" He could imagine the expressions on the faces of the law officers. Then people could argue about whether he was crazy or not while he went to the chair...
He wondered whether Wisconsin had the death penalty. He wondered whether that would matter. He wanted to understand what was going on-and to find out how it was all going to end. And finally, producing a half-rueful grin, he realized that most of all he wanted everything to be normal. He wanted never to have gone to prison, for Laura to still be alive, for none of this ever to have happened.
""I'm afraid that's not exactly an option, m'boy,"" he thought to himself, in Wednesday's gruff voice, and he nodded agreement. Not an option. You burned your bridges. So keep walking. Do your own time...
A distant woodpecker drummed against a rotten log.
Shadow became aware of eyes on him: a handful of red cardinals stared at him from a skeletal elder bush, then returned to pecking at the clusters of black elderberries. They looked like the illustrations in the Songbirds of North America calendar. He heard the birds' video-arcade trills and zaps and whoops follow him along the side of the creek. Eventually, they faded away.
The dead fawn lay in a glade in the shadow of a hill, and a black bird the size of a small dog was picking at its side with a large, wicked beak, rending and tearing gobbets of red meat from the corpse. Its eyes were gone, but its head was untouched, and white fawn-spots were visible on its rump. Shadow wondered how it had died.
The black bird cocked its head onto one side, and then said, in a voice like stones being struck, ""You shadow man.""
""I'm Shadow,"" said Shadow. The bird hopped up onto the fawn's rump, raised its head, ruffled its crown and neck feathers. It was enormous and its eyes were black beads. There was something intimidating about a bird that size, this close.
""Says he will see you in Kay-ro,"" tokked the raven. Shadow wondered which of Odin's ravens this was: Huginn or Muninn: Memory or Thought.
""Kay-ro?"" he asked.
""In Egypt.""
""How am I going to go to Egypt?""
""Follow Mississippi. Go south. Find Jackal.""
""Look,"" said Shadow, ""I don't want to seem like I'm...Jesus, look..."" He paused. Regrouped. He was cold, standing in a wood, talking to a big black bird who was currently brunching on Bambi. ""Okay. What I'm trying to say is, I don't want mysteries.""
""Mysteries,"" agreed the bird, helpfully.
""What I want is explanations. Jackal in Kay-ro. This does not help me. It's a line from a bad spy thriller.""
""Jackal. Friend. Tok. Kay-ro.""
""So you said. I'd like a little more information than that.""
The bird half-turned, and pulled another bloody strip of raw venison from the fawn's ribs. Then it flew off into the trees, the red strip dangling from its beak like a long, bloody worm.
""Hey! Can you at least get me back to a real road?"" called Shadow.
The raven flew up and away. Shadow looked at the corpse of the baby deer. He decided that if he were a real woodsman, he would slice off a steak and grill it over a wood fire. Instead, he sat on a fallen tree and ate a Snickers bar and knew that he really wasn't a real woodsman.
The raven cawed from the edge of the clearing.
""You want me to follow you?"" asked Shadow. ""Or has Timmy fallen down another well?"" The bird cawed again, impatiently. Shadow started walking toward it. It waited until he was close, then flapped heavily into another tree, heading somewhat to the left of the way Shadow had originally been going.
""Hey,"" said Shadow. ""Huginn or Muninn, or whoever you are.""
The bird turned, head tipped, suspiciously, on one side, and it stared at him with bright eyes.
""Say 'Nevermore,'"" said Shadow.
""Fuck you,"" said the raven. It said nothing else as they went through the woodland together, the raven in the lead and flying from tree to tree, the man stomping heavily through the undergrowth trying to catch up.
The sky was a uniform gray. It was almost midday.
In half an hour they reached a blacktop road on the edge of a town, and the raven flew back into the wood. Shadow observed a Culver's Frozen Custard ButterBurgers sign, and, next to it, a gas station. He went into the Culver's, which was empty of customers. There was a keen young man with a shaven head behind the cash register. Shadow ordered two ButterBurgers and french fries. Then he went into the restroom to clean up. He looked a real mess. He did an inventory of the contents of his pockets: he had a few coins, including the silver Liberty dollar, a disposable toothbrush and toothpaste, three Snickers bars, five chemical heater pads, a wallet (with nothing more in it than his driver's license and a credit card-he wondered how much longer the credit card had to live), and in the coat's inside pocket, a thousand dollars in fifties and twenties, his take from yesterday's bank job. He washed his face and hands in hot water, slicked down his dark hair, then went back into the restaurant and ate his burgers and fries, and drank his coffee.
He went back to the counter. ""You want frozen custard?"" asked the keen young man.
""No. No thanks. Is there anywhere around here I could rent a car? My car died, back down the road a way.""
The young man scratched his head-stubble. ""Not around here, mister. If your car died you could call Triple-A. Or talk to the gas station next door about a tow.""
""A fine idea,"" said Shadow. ""Thanks.""
He walked across the melting snow, from the Culver's parking lot to the gas station. He bought candy bars and beef jerky sticks and more chemical hand-and feetwarmers.
""Anywhere hereabouts I could rent a car?"" he asked the woman behind the cash register. She was immensely plump, and bespectacled, and was delighted to have someone to talk to.
""Let me think,"" she said. ""We're kind of out of the way here. They do that kind of thing over in Madison. Where you going?""
""Kay-ro,"" he said. ""Wherever that is.""
""I know where that is,"" she said. ""Hand me that map from that rack over there."" Shadow passed her a plastic-coated map of Illinois. She unfolded it, then pointed in triumph to the bottommost corner of the state. ""There it is.""
""Cairo?""
""That's how they pronounce the one in Egypt. The one in Little Egypt, they call that one Kayro. They got a Thebes down there, all sorts. My sister-in-law comes from Thebes. I asked her about the one in Egypt, she looked at me as if I had a screw loose."" The woman chuckled like a drain.
""Any pyramids?"" The city was five hundred miles away, almost directly south.
""Not that they ever told me. They call it Little Egypt because back, oh, mebbe a hundred, hundred and fifty years back, there was a famine all over. Crops failed. But they didn't fail down there. So everyone went there to buy food. Like in the Bible. Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat. Off we go to Egypt, bad-a-boom.""
""So if you were me, and you needed to get there, how would you go?"" asked Shadow.
""Drive.""
""Car died a few miles down the road. It was a pieceashit if you'll pardon my language,"" said Shadow.
""Pee-Oh-Esses,"" she said. ""Yup. That's what my brother-in-law calls 'em. He buys and sells cars in a small way. He'll call me up, say, 'Mattie, I just sold another Pee-Oh-Ess.' Say, maybe he'd be interested in your old car. For scrap or something.""
""It belongs to my boss,"" said Shadow, surprising himself with the fluency and ease of his lies. ""I need to call him, so he can come pick it up."" A thought struck him. ""Your brother-in-law, is he around here?""
""He's in Muscoda. Ten minutes south of here. Just over the river. Why?""
""Well, does he have a Pee-Oh-Ess he'd like to sell me for, mm, five, six hundred bucks?""
She smiled sweetly. ""Mister, he doesn't have a car on that back lot you couldn't buy with a full tank of gas for five hundred dollars. But don't you tell him I said so.""
""Would you call him?"" asked Shadow.
""I'm way ahead of you,"" she told him, and she picked up the phone. ""Hon? It's Mattie. You get over here this minute. I got a man here wants to buy a car.""
  
The piece of shit he chose was a 1983 Chevy Nova, which he bought, with a full tank of gas, for four hundred and fifty dollars. It had almost a quarter of a million miles on the clock, and smelled faintly of bourbon, tobacco, and more strongly of something that reminded Shadow of bananas. He couldn't tell what color it was, under the dirt and the snow. Still, of all the vehicles in Mattie's brother-in-law's back lot, it was the only one that looked like it might take him five hundred miles.
The deal was done in cash, and Mattie's brother-in-law never asked for Shadow's name or social security number or for anything except the money.
Shadow drove west, then south, with five hundred and fifty dollars in his pocket, keeping off the interstate. The piece of shit had a radio, but nothing happened when he turned it on. A sign said he'd left Wisconsin and was now in Illinois. He passed a strip-mining works, huge blue arc lights burning in the dim midwinter daylight.
He stopped and ate lunch at a place called Mom's, catching them just before they closed for the afternoon. The food was okay.
Each town he passed through had an extra sign up beside the sign telling him that he was now entering Our Town (pop. 720). The extra sign announced that the town's Under-14s team was the third runner-up in the interstate Hundred-Yard Sprint, or that the town was the home of the Illinois Girls' Under-16s Wrestling semifinalist.
He drove on, head nodding, feeling more drained and exhausted with every minute that passed. He ran a stoplight, and was nearly sideswiped by a woman in a Dodge. As soon as he got out into open country he pulled off onto an empty tractor path on the side of the road, and he parked by a snow-spotted stubbly field in which a slow procession of fat black wild turkeys walked like a line of mourners; he turned off the engine, stretched out in the back seat, and fell asleep.
Darkness; a sensation of falling-as if he were tumbling down a great hole, like Alice. He fell for a hundred years into darkness. Faces passed him, swimming out of the black, then each face was ripped up and away before he could touch it...
Abruptly, and without transition, he was not falling. Now he was in a cave, and he was no longer alone. Shadow stared into familiar eyes: huge, liquid black eyes. They blinked.
Under the earth: yes. He remembered this place. The stink of wet cow. Firelight flickered on the wet cave walls, illuminating the buffalo head, the man's body, skin the color of brick clay.
""Can't you people leave me be?"" asked Shadow. ""I just want to sleep.""
The buffalo man nodded, slowly. His lips did not move, but a voice in Shadow's head said, ""Where are you going, Shadow?""
""Cairo.""
""Why?""
""Where else have I got to go? It's where Wednesday wants me to go. I drank his mead."" In Shadow's dream, with the power of dream-logic behind it, the obligation seemed unarguable: he drank Wednesday's mead three times, and sealed the pact-what other choice of action did he have?
The buffalo-headed man reached a hand into the fire, stirring the embers and the broken branches into a blaze. ""The storm is coming,"" he said. Now there was ash on his hands, and he wiped it onto his hairless chest, leaving soot-black streaks.
""So you people keep telling me. Can I ask you a question?""
There was a pause. A fly settled on the furry forehead. The buffalo man flicked it away. ""Ask.""
""Is this true? Are these people really gods? It's all so..."" He paused. Then he said, ""Unlikely,"" which was not exactly the word he had been going for but seemed to be the best he could do.
""What are gods?"" asked the buffalo man.
""I don't know,"" said Shadow.
There was a tapping, relentless and dull. Shadow waited for the buffalo man to say something more, to explain what gods were, to explain the whole tangled nightmare that his life seemed to have become. He was cold. The fire no longer burned.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
Shadow opened his eyes, and, groggily, sat up. He was freezing, and the sky outside the car was the deep luminescent purple that divides the dusk from the night.
Tap. Tap. Someone said, ""Hey, mister,"" and Shadow turned his head. The someone was standing beside the car, no more than a darker shape against the darkling sky. Shadow reached out a hand and cranked down the window a few inches. He made several waking-up noises, and then he said, ""Hi.""
""You all right? You sick? You been drinking?"" The voice was high-a woman's or a boy's.
""I'm fine,"" said Shadow. ""Hold on."" He opened the door, and got out, stretching his aching limbs and neck as he did so. Then he rubbed his hands together, to get the blood circulating and to warm them up.
""Whoa. You're pretty big.""
""That's what they tell me,"" said Shadow. ""Who are you?""
""I'm Sam,"" said the voice.
""Boy Sam or girl Sam?""
""Girl-Sam. I used to be Sammi with an i, and I'd do a smiley face over the i, but then I got completely sick of it because like absolutely everybody was doing it, so I stopped.""
""Okay, girl-Sam. You go over there, and look out at the road.""
""Why? Are you a crazed killer or something?""
""No,"" said Shadow, ""I need to take a leak and I'd like just the smallest amount of privacy.""
""Oh. Right. Okay. Got it. No problem. I am so with you. I can't even pee if there's someone in the next stall. Major shy bladder syndrome.""
""Now, please.""
She walked to the far side of the car, and Shadow took a few steps closer to the field, unzipped his jeans, and pissed against a fencepost for a very long time. He walked back to the car. The last of the gloaming had become night.
""You still there?"" he asked.
""Yes,"" she said. ""You must have a bladder like Lake Erie. I think empires rose and fell in the time it took you to pee. I could hear it the whole time.""
""Thank you. Do you want something?""
""Well, I wanted to see if you were okay. I mean, if you were dead or something I would have called the cops. But the windows were kind of fogged up so I thought, well, he's probably still alive.""
""You live around here?""
""Nope. Hitchhiking down from Madison.""
""That's not safe.""
""I've done it five times a year for three years now. I'm still alive. Where are you headed?""
""I'm going as far as Cairo.""
""Thank you,"" she said. ""I'm going to El Paso. Staying with my aunt for the holidays.""
""I can't take you all the way,"" said Shadow.
""Not El Paso, Texas. The other one, in Illinois. It's a few hours south. You know where you are now?""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""I have no idea. Somewhere on Highway Fifty-two?""
""The next town's Peru,"" said Sam. ""Not the one in Peru. The one in Illinois. Let me smell you. Bend down."" Shadow bent down, and the girl sniffed his face. ""Okay. I don't smell booze. You can drive. Let's go.""
""What makes you think I'm giving you a ride?""
""Because I'm a damsel in distress,"" she said, ""and you are a knight in whatever. A really dirty car. You know someone wrote Wash Me! on your rear windshield?"" Shadow got into the car and opened the passenger door. The light that goes on in cars when the front door is opened did not go on in this car.
""No,"" he said, ""I didn't.""
She climbed in. ""It was me,"" she said. ""I wrote it. While there was still enough light to see.""
Shadow started the car, turned on the headlights, and headed back onto the road. ""Left,"" said Sam helpfully. Shadow turned left, and he drove. After several minutes the heater started to work, and blessed warmth filled the car.
""You haven't said anything yet,"" said Sam. ""Say something.""
""Are you human?"" asked Shadow. ""An honest-to-goodness, born-of-man-and-woman, living breathing human being?""
""Sure,"" she said.
""Okay. Just checking. So what would you like me to say?""
""Something to reassure me, at this point. I suddenly have that oh shit I'm in the wrong car with a crazy man feeling.""
""Yeah,"" he said. ""I've had that one. What would you find reassuring?""
""Just tell me you're not an escaped convict or a mass murderer or something.""
He thought for a moment. ""You know, I'm really not.""
""You had to think about it though, didn't you?""
""Done my time. Never killed anybody.""
""Oh.""
They entered a small town, lit up by streetlights and blinking Christmas decorations, and Shadow glanced to his right. The girl had a tangle of short dark hair and a face that was both attractive and, he decided, faintly mannish: her features might have been chiseled out of rock. She was looking at him.
""What were you in prison for?""
""I hurt a couple of people real bad. I got angry.""
""Did they deserve it?""
Shadow thought for a moment. ""I thought so at the time.""
""Would you do it again?""
""Hell, no. I lost three years of my life in there.""
""Mm. You got Indian blood in you?""
""Not that I know of.""
""You looked like it, was all.""
""Sorry to disappoint you.""
""S'okay. You hungry?""
Shadow nodded. ""I could eat,"" he said.
""There's a good place just past the next set of lights. Good food. Cheap, too.""
Shadow pulled up in the parking lot. They got out of the car. He didn't bother to lock it, although he pocketed the keys. He pulled out some coins to buy a newspaper. ""Can you afford to eat here?"" he asked.
""Yeah,"" she said, raising her chin. ""I can pay for myself.""
Shadow nodded. ""Tell you what. I'll toss you for it,"" he said. ""Heads you pay for my dinner, tails, I pay for yours.""
""Let me see the coin first,"" she said, suspiciously. ""I had an uncle had a double-headed quarter.""
She inspected it, satisfied herself there was nothing strange about the quarter. Shadow placed the coin head-up on his thumb and cheated the toss, so it wobbled and looked like it was spinning, then he caught it and flipped it over onto the back of his left hand, and uncovered it with his right, in front of her.
""Tails,"" she said, happily. ""Dinner's on you.""
""Yup,"" he said. ""You can't win them all.""
Shadow ordered the meatloaf, Sam ordered lasagna. Shadow flipped through the newspaper to see if there was anything in it about dead men in a freight train. There wasn't. The only story of interest was on the cover: crows in record numbers were infesting the town. Local farmers wanted to hang dead crows around the town on public buildings to frighten the others away; ornithologists said that it wouldn't work, that the living crows would simply eat the dead ones. The locals were implacable. ""When they see the corpses of their friends,"" said a spokesman, ""they'll know that we don't want them here.""
The food was good, and it came mounded on steaming plates, more than any one person could eat.
""So what's in Cairo?"" asked Sam, with her mouth full.
""No idea. I got a message from my boss saying he needs me down there.""
""What do you do?""
""I'm an errand boy.""
She smiled. ""Well,"" she said, ""you aren't Mafia, not looking like that and driving that piece of shit. Why does your car smell like bananas, anyway?""
He shrugged, carried on eating.
Sam narrowed her eyes. ""Maybe you're a banana smuggler,"" she said. ""You haven't asked me what I do yet.""
""I figure you're at school.""
""UW Madison.""
""Where you are undoubtedly studying art history, women's studies, and probably casting your own bronzes. And you probably work in a coffee house to help cover the rent.""
She put down her fork, nostrils flaring, eyes wide. ""How the fuck did you do that?""
""What? Now you say, no, actually I'm studying Romance languages and ornithology.""
""So you're saying that was a lucky guess or something?""
""What was?""
She stared at him with dark eyes. ""You are one peculiar guy, Mister...I don't know your name.""
""They call me Shadow,"" he said.
She twisted her mouth wryly, as if she were tasting something she disliked. She stopped talking, put her head down, finished her lasagna.
""Do you know why it's called Egypt?"" asked Shadow, when Sam finished eating.
""Down Cairo way? Yeah. It's in the delta of the Ohio and the Mississippi. Like Cairo in Egypt, in the Nile delta.""
""That makes sense.""
She sat back in her chair, ordered coffee and chocolate cream pie, ran a hand through her black hair. ""You married, Mr. Shadow?"" And then, as he hesitated, ""Gee. I just asked another tricky question, didn't I?""
""They buried her on Thursday,"" he said, picking his words with care. ""She was killed in a car crash.""
""Oh. God. Jesus. I'm sorry.""
""Me too.""
An awkward pause. ""My half-sister lost her kid, my nephew, end of last year. It's rough.""
""Yeah. It is. What did he die of?""
She sipped her coffee. ""We don't know. We don't even really know that he's dead. He just vanished. But he was only thirteen. It was the middle of last winter. My sister was pretty broken up about it.""
""Were there any, any clues?"" He sounded like a TV cop. He tried again. ""Did they suspect foul play?"" That sounded worse.
""They suspected my non-custodial asshole brother-in-law, his father. Who was asshole enough to have stolen him away. Probably did. But this is in a little town in the Northwoods. Lovely, sweet, pretty little town where no one ever locks their doors."" She sighed, shook her head. She held her coffee cup in both hands. Then she looked up at him, changing the subject. ""How did you know I cast bronzes?""
""Lucky guess. It was just something to say.""
""Are you sure you aren't part Indian?""
""Not that I know. It's possible. I never met my father. I guess my ma would have told me if he was Native American, though. Maybe.""
Again the mouth-twist. Sam gave up halfway through her chocolate cream pie: the slice was half the size of her head. She pushed the plate across the table to Shadow. ""You want?"" He smiled, said, ""Sure,"" and finished it off.
The waitress handed them the check, and Shadow paid.
""Thanks,"" said Sam.
It was getting colder now. The car coughed a couple of times before it started. Shadow drove back onto the road, and kept going south. ""You ever read a guy named Herodotus?"" he asked.
""Jesus. What?""
""Herodotus. You ever read his Histories?""
""You know,"" she said, dreamily, ""I don't get it. I don't get how you talk, or the words you use or anything. One moment you're a big dumb guy, the next you're reading my friggin' mind, and the next we're talking about Herodotus. So no. I have not read Herodotus. I've heard about him. Maybe on NPR. Isn't he the one they call the father of lies?""
""I thought that was the Devil.""
""Yeah, him too. But they were talking about Herodotus saying there were giant ants and gryphons guarding gold mines, and how he made this stuff up.""
""I don't think so. He wrote what he'd been told. It's like, he's writing these histories. And they're mostly pretty good histories. Loads of weird little details-like, did you know, in Egypt, if a particularly beautiful girl, or the wife of a lord or whatever, died, they wouldn't send her to the embalmer for three days? They'd let her body spoil in the heat first.""
""Why? Oh, hold on. Okay, I think I know why. Oh, that's disgusting.""
""And there're battles in there, all sorts of normal things. And then there are the gods. Some guy is running back to report on the outcome of a battle and he's running and running, and he sees Pan in a glade. And Pan says, 'Tell them to build me a temple here.' So he says okay, and runs the rest of the way back. And he reports the battle news, and then says, 'Oh, and by the way, Pan wants you to build him a temple.' It's really matter-of-fact, you know?""
""So there are stories with gods in them. What are you trying to say? That these guys had hallucinations?""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""That's not it.""
She chewed a hangnail. ""I read some book about brains,"" she said. ""My roommate had it and she kept waving it around. It was like, how five thousand years ago the lobes of the brain fused and before that people thought when the right lobe of the brain said anything it was the voice of some god telling them what to do. It's just brains.""
""I like my theory better,"" said Shadow.
""What's your theory?""
""That back then people used to run into the gods from time to time.""
""Oh."" Silence: only the rattling of the car, the roar of the engine, the growling of the muffler-which did not sound healthy. Then, ""Do you think they're still there?""
""Where?""
""Greece. Egypt. The islands. Those places. Do you think if you walked where those people walked you'd see the gods?""
""Maybe. But I don't think people'd know that was what they'd seen.""
""I bet it's like space aliens,"" she said. ""These days, people see space aliens. Back then they saw gods. Maybe the space aliens come from the right side of the brain.""
""I don't think the gods ever gave rectal probes,"" said Shadow. ""And they didn't mutilate cattle themselves. They got people to do it for them.""
She chuckled. They drove in silence for a few minutes, and then she said, ""Hey, that reminds me of my favorite god story, from Comparative Religion 101. You want to hear it?""
""Sure,"" said Shadow.
""Okay. This is one about Odin. The Norse god. You know? There was some Viking king on a Viking ship-this was back in the Viking times, obviously-and they were becalmed, so he says he'll sacrifice one of his men to Odin if Odin will send them a wind, and get them to land. Okay. The wind comes up, and they get to land. So, on land, they draw lots to figure out who gets sacrificed-and it's the king himself. Well, he's not happy about this, but they figure out that they can hang him in effigy and not hurt him. They take a calf's intestines and loop them loosely around the guy's neck, and they tie the other end to a thin branch, and they take a reed instead of a spear and poke him with it and go, 'Okay, you've been hung'-hanged?-whatever-'you've been sacrificed to Odin.'""
The road curved: Another Town, pop. 300, home of the runner-up to the State Under-12s speed-skating championship, two huge giant economy-sized funeral parlors on each side of the road, and how many funeral parlors do you need, Shadow wondered, when you only have three hundred people...?
""Okay. As soon as they say Odin's name, the reed transforms into a spear and stabs the guy in the side, the calf intestines become a thick rope, the branch becomes a bough of a tree, and the tree pulls up, and the ground drops away, and the king is left hanging there to die with a wound in his side and his face going black. End of story. White people have some fucked-up gods, Mister Shadow.""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""You're not white?""
""I'm a Cherokee,"" she said.
""Full-blooded?""
""Nope. Only four pints. My mom was white. My dad was a real reservation Indian. He came out this way, eventually married my mom, had me, then when they split he went back to Oklahoma.""
""He went back to the reservation?""
""No. He borrowed money and opened a Taco Bell knock-off called Taco Bill's. He does okay. He doesn't like me. Says I'm half-breed.""
""I'm sorry.""
""He's a jerk. I'm proud of my Indian blood. It helps pay my college tuition. Hell, one day it'll probably help get me a job, if I can't sell my bronzes.""
""There's always that,"" said Shadow.
He stopped in El Paso, IL (pop. 2,500), to let Sam out at a down-at-heel house on the edge of the town. A large wire-framed model of a reindeer covered in twinkling lights stood in the front yard. ""You want to come in?"" she asked. ""My aunt would give you a coffee.""
""No,"" he said. ""I've got to keep moving.""
She smiled at him, looking suddenly, and for the first time, vulnerable. She patted him on the arm. ""You're fucked up, mister. But you're cool.""
""I believe that's what they call the human condition,"" said Shadow. ""Thanks for the company.""
""No problem,"" she said. ""If you see any gods on the road to Cairo, you make sure and say hi to them from me."" She got out of the car, and went to the door of the house. She pressed a doorbell and stood there at the door, without looking back. Shadow waited until the door was opened and she was safely inside before he put his foot down and headed back for the highway. He passed through Normal, and Bloomington, and Lawndale.
At eleven that night Shadow started shaking. He was just entering Middletown. He decided he needed sleep, or just not to drive any longer, and he pulled up in front of a Night's Inn, paid thirty-five dollars, cash in advance, for his ground-floor room, and went into the bathroom. A sad cockroach lay on its back in the middle of the tiled floor. Shadow took a towel and cleaned off the inside of the tub with it, then ran a bath. In the main room he took off his clothes and put them on the bed. The bruises on his torso were dark and vivid. He sat in the bath, watching the color of the bathwater change. Then, naked, he washed his socks and briefs and T-shirt in the basin, wrung them out and hung them on the clothesline that pulled out from the wall above the bathtub. He left the cockroach where it was, out of respect for the dead.
Shadow climbed into the bed. He wondered about watching an adult movie, but the pay-per-view device by the phone needed a credit card. Then again, he was not convinced that it would make him feel any better to watch other people have sex that he wasn't having. He turned on the TV for company, pressed the Sleep button on the remote three times, which would make the TV set turn itself off automatically in forty-five minutes, by which time he figured he'd be fast asleep. It was a quarter to midnight.
The picture was motel-fuzzy, and the colors swam across the screen. He flipped from late show to late show in the televisual wasteland, unable to focus. Someone was demonstrating something that did something in the kitchen, and replaced a dozen other kitchen utensils, none of which Shadow possessed. Flip. A man in a suit explained that these were the end times and that Jesus-a four-or five-syllable word the way the man pronounced it-would make Shadow's business prosper and thrive if Shadow sent him money. Flip: an episode of M*A*S*H ended and a Dick Van Dyke episode began.
Shadow hadn't seen an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show for years, but there was something comforting about the 1965 black-and-white world it painted, and he put the channel changer down beside the bed, and turned off the bedside light. He watched the show, eyes slowly closing, aware that something was odd. He had not seen many episodes of The Dick Van Dyke Show, so he was not surprised that it was an episode he could not remember seeing before. What he found strange was the tone.
All the regulars were concerned about Rob's drinking: he was missing days at work. They went to his home: he had locked himself in the bedroom, and had to be persuaded to come out: he was staggering drunk, but still pretty funny. His friends, played by Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie, left after getting some good gags in. Then, when Rob's wife went to remonstrate with him, he hit her, hard, in the face. She sat down on the floor and began to cry, not in that famous Mary Tyler Moore wail, but in small, helpless sobs, hugging herself and whispering, ""Don't hit me, please, I'll do anything, just don't hit me any more.""
""What the fuck is this?"" said Shadow, aloud.
The picture dissolved into phosphor-dot fuzz. When it came back, The Dick Van Dyke Show had, inexplicably, become I Love Lucy. Lucy was trying to persuade Ricky to let her replace their old icebox with a new refrigerator. When he left, however, she walked over to the couch and sat down, crossing her ankles, resting her hands in her lap, and staring out patiently in black and white across the years.
""Shadow?"" she said. ""We need to talk.""
Shadow said nothing. She opened her purse and took out a cigarette, lit it with an expensive silver lighter, put the lighter away. ""I'm talking to you,"" she said. ""Well?""
""This is crazy,"" said Shadow.
""Like the rest of your life is sane? Give me a fucking break.""
""Whatever. Lucille Ball talking to me from the TV is weirder by several orders of magnitude than anything that's happened to me so far,"" said Shadow.
""It's not Lucille Ball. It's Lucy Ricardo. And you know something-I'm not even her. It's just an easy way to look, given the context. That's all."" She shifted uncomfortably on the sofa.
""Who are you?"" asked Shadow.
""Okay,"" she said. ""Good question. I'm the idiot box. I'm the TV. I'm the all-seeing eye and the world of the cathode ray. I'm the boob tube. I'm the little shrine the family gathers to adore.""
""You're the television? Or someone in the television?""
""The TV's the altar. I'm what people are sacrificing to.""
""What do they sacrifice?"" asked Shadow.
""Their time, mostly,"" said Lucy. ""Sometimes each other."" She raised two fingers, blew imaginary gun smoke from the tips. Then she winked, a big old I Love Lucy wink.
""You're a god?"" said Shadow.
Lucy smirked, and took a lady-like puff of her cigarette. ""You could say that,"" she said.
""Sam says hi,"" said Shadow.
""What? Who's Sam? What are you talking about?""
Shadow looked at his watch. It was twenty-five past twelve. ""Doesn't matter,"" he said. ""So, Lucy-on-the-TV. What do we need to talk about? Too many people have needed to talk recently. Normally it ends with someone hitting me.""
The camera moved in for a close-up: Lucy looked concerned, her lips pursed. ""I hate that. I hate that people were hurting you, Shadow. I'd never do that, honey. No, I want to offer you a job.""
""Doing what?""
""Working for me. I'm really sorry. I heard about the trouble you had with the Spookshow, and I was impressed with how you dealt with it. Efficient, no-nonsense, effective. Who'd've thought you had it in you? They are really pissed.""
""Really?""
""They underestimated you, sweetheart. Not a mistake I'm going to make. I want you in my camp."" She stood up, walked toward the camera. ""Look at it like this, Shadow: we are the coming thing. We're shopping malls-your friends are crappy roadside attractions. Hell, we're online malls, while your friends are sitting by the side of the highway selling homegrown produce from a garden cart. No-they aren't even fruit sellers. Buggy-whip vendors. Whalebone-corset repairers. We are now and tomorrow. Your friends aren't even yesterday any more.""
It was a strangely familiar speech. Shadow asked, ""Did you ever meet a fat kid in a limo?""
She spread her hands and rolled her eyes comically, funny Lucy Ricardo washing her hands of a disaster. ""The technical boy? You met the technical boy? Look, he's a good kid. He's one of us. He's just not good with people he doesn't know. When you're working for us, you'll see how amazing he is.""
""And if I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy?""
There was a knock on the door of Lucy's apartment, and Ricky's voice could be heard off-stage, asking Loo-cy what was keepin' her so long, they was due down at the club in the next scene; a flash of irritation touched Lucy's cartoonish face. ""Hell,"" she said. ""Look, whatever the old guys are paying you, I can pay you double. Treble. A hundred times. Whatever they're giving you, I can give you so much more."" She smiled, a perfect, roguish, Lucy Ricardo smile. ""You name it, honey. What do you need?"" She began to undo the buttons of her blouse. ""Hey,"" she said. ""You ever wanted to see Lucy's tits?""
The screen went black. The sleep function had kicked in and the set turned itself off. Shadow looked at his watch: it was half past midnight. ""Not really,"" said Shadow.
He rolled over in bed and closed his eyes. It occurred to him that the reason he liked Wednesday and Mr. Nancy and the rest of them better than their opposition was pretty straightforward: they might be dirty, and cheap, and their food might taste like shit, but at least they didn't speak in clichés.
And he would take a roadside attraction, no matter how cheap, how crooked, or how sad, over a shopping mall, any day.
  
Morning found Shadow back on the road, driving through a gently undulating brown landscape of winter grass and leafless trees. The last of the snow had vanished. He filled up the tank of the piece of shit in a town which was home to the runner-up of the State Women's Under-16s three-hundred-meter dash, and, hoping that the dirt wasn't all that was holding it together, he ran the car through the gas station car wash, and was surprised to discover that the car was, when clean, against all reason, white, and pretty much free of rust. He drove on.
The sky was impossibly blue, and white industrial smoke rising from factory chimneys was frozen in the sky, like a photograph. A hawk launched itself from a dead tree and flew toward him, wings strobing in the sunlight like a series of stop-motion photographs.
At some point he found himself heading into East St. Louis. He attempted to avoid it and instead found himself driving through what appeared to be a red-light district in an industrial park. Eighteen-wheelers and huge rigs were parked outside buildings that looked like temporary warehouses, that claimed to be 24 HOUR NITE CLUBs and, in one case, THE BEST PEAP SHOW IN TOWN. Shadow shook his head, and drove on. Laura had loved to dance, clothed or naked (and, on several memorable evenings, moving from one state to the other), and he had loved to watch her.
Lunch was a sandwich and a can of Coke in a town called Red Bud.
He passed a valley filled with the wreckage of thousands of yellow bulldozers, tractors and Caterpillars. He wondered if this was the bulldozers' graveyard, where the bulldozers went to die.
He drove past the Pop-a-Top Lounge. He drove through Chester (""Home of Popeye""). He noticed that the houses had started to gain pillars out front, that even the shabbiest, thinnest house now had its white pillars, proclaiming it, in someone's eyes, a mansion. He drove over a big, muddy river, and laughed out loud when he saw that the name of it, according to the sign, was the Big Muddy River. He saw a covering of brown kudzu over three winter-dead trees, twisting them into strange, almost human shapes: they could have been witches, three bent old crones ready to reveal his fortune.
He drove alongside the Mississippi. Shadow had never seen the Nile, but there was a blinding afternoon sun burning on the wide brown river which made him think of the muddy expanse of the Nile: not the Nile as it is now, but as it was long ago, flowing like an artery through the papyrus marshes, home to cobra and jackal and wild cow...
A road sign pointed to Thebes.
The road was built up about twelve feet, so he was driving above the marshes. Clumps and clusters of birds in flight were questing back and forth, black dots against the blue sky, moving in some kind of desperate Brownian motion.
In the late afternoon the sun began to lower, gilding the world in elf-light, a thick warm custardy light that made the world feel unearthly and more than real, and it was in this light that Shadow passed the sign telling him he was Now Entering Historical Cairo. He drove under a bridge and found himself in a small port town. The imposing structure of the Cairo courthouse and the even more imposing customs house looked like enormous freshly baked cookies in the syrupy gold of the light at the end of the day.
He parked his car in a side street and walked to the embankment at the edge of a river, unsure whether he was gazing at the Ohio or the Mississippi. A small brown cat nosed and sprang among the trashcans at the back of a building, and the light made even the garbage magical.
A lone seagull was gliding along the river's edge, flipping a wing to correct itself as it went.
Shadow realized that he was not alone. A small girl, wearing old tennis shoes on her feet and a man's gray woolen sweater as a dress, was standing on the sidewalk, ten feet away from him, staring at him with the somber gravity of a six-year-old. Her hair was black, and straight, and long; her skin was as brown as the river.
He grinned at her. She stared back at him, defiantly.
There was a squeal and a yowl from the waterfront, and the little brown cat shot away from a spilled garbage can, pursued by a long-muzzled black dog. The cat scurried under a car.
""Hey,"" said Shadow to the girl. ""You ever seen invisible powder before?""
She hesitated. Then she shook her head.
""Okay,"" said Shadow. ""Well, watch this."" Shadow pulled out a quarter with his left hand, held it up, tilting it from one side to another, then appeared to toss it into his right hand, closing his hand hard on nothing, and putting the hand forward. ""Now,"" he said, ""I just take some invisible powder from my pocket""-and he reached his left hand into his breast pocket, dropping the quarter into the pocket as he did so-""and I sprinkle it on the hand with the coin""-and he mimed sprinkling, -""and look-now the quarter's invisible too."" He opened his empty right hand, and, in astonishment, his empty left hand as well.
The little girl just stared.
Shadow shrugged and put his hands back in his pockets, loading a quarter in one hand, a folded-up five-dollar bill in the other. He was going to produce them from the air, and then give the girl the five bucks: she looked like she needed it. ""Hey,"" he said, ""we've got an audience.""
The black dog and the little brown cat were watching him as well, flanking the girl, looking up at him intently. The dog's huge ears were pricked up, giving it a comically alert expression. A crane-like man with gold-rimmed spectacles was coming up the sidewalk toward them, peering from side to side as if he were looking for something. Shadow wondered if he was the dog's owner.
""What did you think?"" Shadow asked the dog, trying to put the little girl at her ease. ""Was that cool?""
The black dog licked its long snout. Then it said, in a deep, dry voice, ""I saw Harry Houdini once, and believe me, man, you are no Harry Houdini.""
The little girl looked at the animals, she looked up at Shadow, and then she ran off, her feet pounding the sidewalk as if all the powers of hell were after her. The two animals watched her go. The crane-like man had reached the dog. He leaned down and scratched its high, pointed ears.
""Come on,"" said the man in the gold-rimmed spectacles to the dog. ""It was only a coin trick. It's not like he was doing an underwater escape.""
""Not yet,"" said the dog. ""But he will."" The golden light was done, and the gray of twilight had begun.
Shadow dropped the coin and the folded bill back into his pocket. ""Okay,"" he said. ""Which one of you is Jackal?""
""Use your eyes,"" said the black dog with the long snout. ""This way."" It began to amble along the sidewalk, beside the man in the gold-rimmed glasses, and, after a moment's hesitation, Shadow followed them. The cat was nowhere to be seen. They reached a large old building on a row of boarded-up houses.
The sign beside the door said IBIS AND JACQUEL. A FAMILY FIRM. FUNERAL PARLOR. SINCE 1863.
""I'm Mister Ibis,"" said the man in the gold-rimmed glasses. ""I think I should buy you a spot of supper. I'm afraid my friend here has some work that needs doing.""

Somewhere in America 
New York scares Salim, and so he clutches his sample case protectively with both hands, holding it to his chest. He is scared of black people, the way they stare at him, and he is scared of the Jews, the ones dressed all in black with hats and beards and side curls he can identify and how many others that he cannot; he is scared of the sheer quantity of the people, all shapes and sizes of people, as they spill from their high, high, filthy buildings onto the sidewalks; he is scared of the honking hullabaloo of the traffic, and he is even scared of the air, which smells both dirty and sweet, and nothing at all like the air of Oman.
Salim has been in New York, in America, for a week. Each day he visits two, perhaps three different offices, opens his sample case, shows them the copper trinkets, the rings and bottles and tiny flashlights, the models of the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, gleaming in copper inside; each night he writes a fax to his brother-in-law, Fuad, at home in Muscat, telling him that he has taken no orders, or, on one happy day, that he had taken several orders (but, as Salim is painfully aware, not yet enough even to cover his airfare and hotel bill).
For reasons Salim does not understand, his brother-in-law's business partners have booked him into the Paramount Hotel on Forty-sixth Street. He finds it confusing, claustrophobic, expensive, alien.
Fuad is Salim's sister's husband. He is not a rich man, but he is the co-owner of a small trinket factory, making knickknacks from copper, brooches and rings and bracelets and statues. Everything is made for export, to other Arab countries, to Europe, to America.
Salim has been working for Fuad for six months. Fuad scares him a little. The tone of Fuad's faxes is becoming harsher. In the evening, Salim sits in his hotel room, reading his Qur'an, telling himself that this will pass, that his stay in this strange world is limited and finite.
His brother-in-law gave him a thousand dollars for miscellaneous traveling expenses and the money, which seemed so huge a sum when first he saw it, is evaporating faster than Salim can believe. When he first arrived, scared of being seen as a cheap Arab, he tipped everyone, handing extra dollar bills to everyone he encountered; and then he decided that he was being taken advantage of, that perhaps they were even laughing at him, and he stopped tipping entirely.
On his first and only journey by subway he got lost and confused, and missed his appointment; now he takes taxis only when he has to, and the rest of the time he walks. He stumbles into overheated offices, his cheeks numb from the cold outside, sweating beneath his coat, shoes soaked by slush; and when the winds blow down the avenues (which run from north to south, as the streets run west to east, all so simple, and Salim always knows where to face Mecca) he feels a cold on his exposed skin that is so intense it is like being struck.
He never eats at the hotel (for while the hotel bill is being covered by Fuad's business partners, he must pay for his own food); instead he buys food at falafel houses and at little food stores, smuggles it up to the hotel beneath his coat for days before he realizes that no one cares. And even then he feels strange about carrying the bags of food into the dimly lit elevators (Salim always has to bend and squint to find the button to press to take him to his floor) and up to the tiny white room in which he stays.
Salim is upset. The fax that was waiting for him when he woke this morning was curt, and alternately chiding, stern, and disappointed: Salim was letting them down-his sister, Fuad, Fuad's business partners, the Sultanate of Oman, the whole Arab world. Unless he was able to get the orders, Fuad would no longer consider it his obligation to employ Salim. They depended upon him. His hotel was too expensive. What was Salim doing with their money, living like a sultan in America? Salim read the fax in his room (which has always been too hot and stifling, so last night he opened a window, and was now too cold) and sat there for a time, his face frozen into an expression of complete misery.
Then Salim walked downtown, holding his sample case as if it contained diamonds and rubies, trudging through the cold for block after block until, on Broadway and Nineteenth Street, he finds a squat building over a Laundromat and walks up the stairs to the fourth floor, to the office of Panglobal Imports.
The office is dingy, but he knows that Panglobal handles almost half of the ornamental souvenirs that enter the U.S. from the Far East. A real order, a significant order, from Panglobal could redeem Salim's journey, could make the difference between failure and success, so Salim sits on an uncomfortable wooden chair in an outer office, his sample case balanced on his lap, staring at the middle-aged woman with her hair dyed too bright a red who sits behind the desk, blowing her nose on Kleenex after Kleenex. After she blows her nose she wipes it, and drops the Kleenex into the trash.
Salim got there at 10:30 A.M., half an hour before his appointment. Now he sits there, flushed and shivering, wondering if he is running a fever. The time ticks by so slowly.
Salim looks at his watch. Then he clears his throat.
The woman behind the desk glares at him. ""Yes?"" she says. It sounds like Yed.
""It is eleven thirty-five,"" says Salim.
The woman glances at the clock on the wall, and says, ""Yed,"" again. ""Id id.""
""My appointment was for eleven,"" says Salim with a placating smile.
""Mister Blanding knows you're here,"" she tells him, reprovingly. Bidter Bladdig dode you're here.
Salim picks up an old copy of the New York Post from the table. He speaks English better than he reads it, and he puzzles his way through the stories like a man doing a crossword puzzle. He waits, a plump young man with the eyes of a hurt puppy, glancing from his watch to his newspaper to the clock on the wall.
At twelve thirty several men come out from the inner office. They talk loudly, jabbering away to each other in American. One of them, a big, paunchy man, has a cigar, unlit, in his mouth. He glances at Salim as he comes out. He tells the woman behind the desk to try the juice of a lemon, and zinc, as his sister swears by zinc, and vitamin C. She promises him that she will, and gives him several envelopes. He pockets them and then he, and the other men, go out into the hall. The sound of their laughter disappears down the stairwell.
It is one o'clock. The woman behind the desk opens a drawer and takes out a brown paper bag, from which she removes several sandwiches, an apple, and a Milky Way. She also takes out a small plastic bottle of freshly squeezed orange juice.
""Excuse me,"" says Salim, ""but can you perhaps call Mister Blanding and tell him that I am still waiting?""
She looks up at him as if surprised to see that he is still there, as if they have not been sitting five feet apart for two and a half hours. ""He's at lunch,"" she says. He'd ad dudge.
Salim knows, knows deep down in his gut, that Blanding was the man with the unlit cigar. ""When will he be back?""
She shrugs, takes a bite of her sandwich. ""He's busy with appointments for the rest of the day,"" she says. He'd biddy wid abboidmeds for the red ob the day.
""Will he see me, then, when he comes back?"" asks Salim.
She shrugs, and blows her nose.
Salim is hungry, increasingly so, and frustrated, and powerless.
At three o'clock the woman looks at him and says, ""He wode be gubbig bag.""
""Excuse?""
""Bidder Bladdig. He wode be gubbig bag today.""
""Can I make an appointment for tomorrow?""
She wipes her nose. ""You hab to teddephode. Appoidbeds odly by teddephode.""
""I see,"" says Salim. And then he smiles: a salesman, Fuad had told him many times before he left Muscat, is naked in America without his smile. ""Tomorrow I will telephone,"" he says. He takes his sample case, and he walks down the many stairs to the street, where the freezing rain is turning to sleet. Salim contemplates the long, cold walk back to the Forty-sixth Street hotel, and the weight of the sample case, then he steps to the edge of the sidewalk and waves at every yellow cab that approaches, whether the light on top is on or off, and every cab drives past him.
One of them accelerates as it passes; a wheel dives into a water-filled pothole, spraying freezing muddy water over Salim's pants and coat. For a moment, he contemplates throwing himself in front of one of the lumbering cars, and then he realizes that his brother-in-law would be more concerned with the fate of the sample case than that of Salim himself, and that he would bring grief to no one but his beloved sister, Fuad's wife (for Salim had always been a slight embarrassment to his father and mother, and his romantic encounters had always, of necessity, been both brief and relatively anonymous): also, he doubts that any of the cars is going fast enough actually to end his life.
A battered yellow taxi draws up beside him and, grateful to be able to abandon his train of thought, Salim gets in.
The back seat is patched with gray duct tape; the half-open Plexiglas barrier is covered with notices warning him not to smoke, telling him how much to pay to the various airports. The recorded voice of somebody famous he has never heard of tells him to remember to wear his seatbelt.
""The Paramount Hotel, please,"" says Salim.
The cab driver grunts, and pulls away from the curb, into the traffic. He is unshaven, and he wears a thick, dust-colored sweater, and black plastic sunglasses. The weather is gray, and night is falling: Salim wonders if the man has a problem with his eyes. The wipers smear the street scene into grays and smudged lights.
From nowhere, a truck pulls out in front of them, and the cab driver swears in Arabic, by the beard of the Prophet.
Salim stares at the name on the dashboard, but he cannot make it out from here. ""How long have you been driving a cab, my friend?"" he asks the man, in Arabic.
""Ten years,"" says the driver, in the same language. ""Where are you from?""
""Muscat,"" says Salim. ""In Oman.""
""From Oman. I have been in Oman. It was a long time ago. Have you heard of the city of Ubar?"" asks the taxi driver.
""Indeed I have,"" says Salim. ""The Lost City of Towers. They found it in the desert five, ten years ago, I do not remember exactly. Were you with the expedition that excavated it?""
""Something like that. It was a good city,"" says the taxi driver. ""On most nights there would be three, maybe four thousand people camped there: every traveler would rest at Ubar, and the music would play, and the wine would flow like water and the water would flow as well, which was why the city existed.""
""That is what I have heard,"" says Salim. ""And it perished, what, a thousand years ago? Two thousand?""
The taxi driver says nothing. They are stopped at a red traffic light. The light turns green, but the taxi driver does not move, despite the immediate discordant blare of horns behind them. Hesitantly, Salim reaches through the hole in the Plexiglas and he touches the driver on the shoulder. The man's head jerks up, with a start, and he puts his foot down on the gas, lurching them across the intersection.
""Fuckshitfuckfuck,"" he says, in English.
""You must be very tired, my friend,"" says Salim.
""I have been driving this Allah-forgotten taxi for thirty hours,"" says the driver. ""It is too much. Before that, I sleep for five hours, and I drove fourteen hours before that. We are shorthanded, before Christmas.""
""I hope you have made a lot of money,"" says Salim.
The driver sighs. ""Not much. This morning I drove a man from Fifty-first Street to Newark airport. When we got there, he ran off into the airport, and I could not find him again. A fifty-dollar fare gone, and I had to pay the tolls on the way back myself.""
Salim nods. ""I had to spend today waiting to see a man who will not see me. My brother-in-law hates me. I have been in America for a week, and it has done nothing but eat my money. I sell nothing.""
""What do you sell?""
""Shit,"" says Salim. ""Worthless gewgaws and baubles and tourist trinkets. Horrible, cheap, foolish, ugly shit.""
The taxi driver wrenches the wheel to the right, swings around something, drives on. Salim wonders how he can see to drive, between the rain, the night, and the thick sunglasses.
""You try to sell shit?""
""Yes,"" says Salim, thrilled and horrified that he has spoken the truth about his brother-in-law's samples.
""And they will not buy it?""
""No.""
""Strange. You look at the stores here, that is all they sell.""
Salim smiles nervously.
A truck is blocking the street in front of them: a red-faced cop standing in front of it waves and shouts and points them down the nearest street.
""We will go over to Eighth Avenue, come uptown that way,"" says the taxi driver. They turn onto the street, where the traffic has stopped completely. There is a cacophony of horns, but the cars do not move.
The driver sways in his seat. His chin begins to descend to his chest, one, two, three times. Then he begins, gently, to snore. Salim reaches out to wake the man, hoping that he is doing the right thing. As he shakes his shoulder the driver moves, and Salim's hand brushes the man's face, knocking the man's sunglasses from his face onto his lap.
The taxi driver opens his eyes and reaches for, and replaces, the black plastic sunglasses, but it is too late. Salim has seen his eyes.
The car crawls forward in the rain. The numbers on the meter increase.
""Are you going to kill me?"" asks Salim.
The taxi driver's lips are pressed together. Salim watches his face in the driver's mirror.
""No,"" says the driver.
The car stops again. The rain patters on the roof.
Salim begins to speak. ""My grandmother swore that she had seen an ifrit, or perhaps a marid, late one evening, on the edge of the desert. We told her that it was just a sandstorm, a little wind, but she said no, she saw its face, and its eyes, like yours, were burning flames.""
The driver smiles, but his eyes are hidden behind the black plastic glasses, and Salim cannot tell whether there is any humor in that smile or not. ""The grandmothers came here too,"" he says.
""Are there many jinn in New York?"" asks Salim.
""No. Not many of us.""
""There are the angels, and there are men, who Allah made from mud, and then there are the people of the fire, the jinn,"" says Salim.
""People know nothing about my people here,"" says the driver. ""They think we grant wishes. If I could grant wishes do you think I would be driving a cab?""
""I do not understand.""
The taxi driver seems gloomy. Salim watches his face in the mirror as he speaks, staring at the ifrit's dark lips.
""They believe that we grant wishes. Why do they believe that? I sleep in one stinking room in Brooklyn. I drive this taxi for any stinking freak who has the money to ride in it, and for some who don't. I drive them where they need to go, and sometimes they tip me. Sometimes they pay me."" His lower lip began to tremble. The ifrit seemed on edge. ""One of them shat on the back seat once. I had to clean it before I could take the cab back. How could he do that? I had to clean the wet shit from the seat. Is that right?""
Salim puts out a hand, pats the ifrit's shoulder. He can feel solid flesh through the wool of the sweater. The ifrit raises his hand from the wheel, rests it on Salim's hand for a moment.
Salim thinks of the desert then: red sands blow a dust-storm through his thoughts, and the scarlet silks of the tents that surrounded the lost city of Ubar flap and billow through his mind.
They drive up Eighth Avenue.
""The old believe. They do not piss into holes, because the Prophet told them that jinn live in holes. They know that the angels throw flaming stars at us when we try to listen to their conversations. But even for the old, when they come to this country we are very, very far away. Back there, I did not have to drive a cab.""
""I am sorry,"" says Salim.
""It is a bad time,"" says the driver. ""A storm is coming. It scares me. I would do anything to get away.""
The two of them say nothing more on their way back to the hotel.
When Salim gets out of the cab he gives the ifrit a twenty-dollar bill, tells him to keep the change. Then, with a sudden burst of courage, he tells him his room number. The taxi driver says nothing in reply. A young woman clambers into the back of the cab, and it pulls out into the cold and the rain.
Six o'clock in the evening. Salim has not yet written the fax to his brother-in-law. He goes out into the rain, buys himself this night's kebab and french fries. It has only been a week, but he feels that he is becoming heavier, rounder, softening in this country of New York.
When he comes back to the hotel he is surprised to see the taxi driver standing in the lobby, hands deep into his pockets. He is staring at a display of black-and-white postcards. When he sees Salim he smiles, self-consciously. ""I called your room,"" he says, ""but there was no answer. So I thought I would wait.""
Salim smiles also, and touches the man's arm. ""I am here,"" he says.
Together they enter the dim, green-lit elevator, ascend to the fifth floor holding hands. The ifrit asks if he may use Salim's bathroom. ""I feel very dirty,"" he says. Salim nods. He sits on the bed, which fills most of the small white room, and listens to the sound of the shower running. Salim takes off his shoes, his socks, and then the rest of his clothes.
The taxi driver comes out of the shower, wet, with a towel wrapped about his mid-section. He is not wearing his sunglasses, and in the dim room his eyes burn with scarlet flames.
Salim blinks back tears. ""I wish you could see what I see,"" he says.
""I do not grant wishes,"" whispers the ifrit, dropping his towel and pushing Salim gently, but irresistibly, down onto the bed.
It is an hour or more before the ifrit comes, thrusting and grinding into Salim's mouth. Salim has already come twice in this time. The jinn's semen tastes strange, fiery, and it burns Salim's throat.
Salim goes to the bathroom, washes out his mouth. When he returns to the bedroom the taxi driver is already asleep in the white bed, snoring peacefully. Salim climbs into the bed beside him, cuddles close to the ifrit, imagining the desert on his skin.
As he starts to fall asleep he realizes that he still has not written his fax to Fuad, and he feels guilty. Deep inside he feels empty and alone: he reaches out, rests his hand on the ifrit's tumescent cock and, comforted, he sleeps.
They wake in the small hours, moving against each other, and they make love again. At one point Salim realizes that he is crying, and the ifrit is kissing away his tears with burning lips. ""What is your name?"" Salim asks the taxi driver.
""There is a name on my driving permit, but it is not mine,"" the ifrit says.
Afterward, Salim could not remember where the sex had stopped and the dreams began.
When Salim wakes, the cold sun creeping into the white room, he is alone.
Also, he discovers, his sample case is gone, all the bottles and rings and souvenir copper flashlights, all gone, along with his suitcase, his wallet, his passport, and his air tickets back to Oman.
He finds a pair of jeans, the T-shirt, and the dust-colored woolen sweater discarded on the floor. Beneath them he finds a driver's license in the name of Ibrahim bin Irem, a taxi permit in the same name, and a ring of keys with an address written on a piece of paper attached to them in English. The photographs on the license and the permit ID do not look much like Salim, but then, they did not look much like the ifrit.
The telephone rings: it is the front desk calling to point out that Salim has already checked out, and his guest needs to leave soon so that they can service the room, to get it ready for another occupant.
""I do not grant wishes,"" says Salim, tasting the way the words shape themselves in his mouth.
He feels strangely light-headed as he dresses.
New York is very simple: the avenues run north to south, the streets run west to east. How hard can it be? he asks himself.
He tosses the car keys into the air and catches them. Then he puts on the black plastic sunglasses he found in the pockets, and leaves the hotel room to go and look for his cab.
AG_ch7	AG	American Gods	7	7587	41338	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 

Everything is upon a great scale upon this continent. The rivers are immense, the climate violent in heat and cold, the prospects magnificent, the thunder and lightning tremendous. The disorders incident to the country make every constitution tremble. Our own blunders here, our misconduct, our losses, our disgraces, our ruin, are on a great scale.
-LORD CARLISLE, TO GEORGE SELWYN, 1778 
The most important place in the southeastern United States is advertised on hundreds of aging barn-roofs across Georgia and Tennessee and up into Kentucky. On a winding road through a forest a driver will pass a rotting red barn, and see, painted on its roof
SEE ROCK CITY THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD 
and on the roof of a tumbledown milking shed nearby, painted in white block letters,
SEE SEVEN STATES FROM ROCK CITY THE WORLD'S WONDER 
The driver is led by this to believe that Rock City is surely just around the nearest corner instead of being a day's drive away, on Lookout Mountain, a hair over the state line, in Georgia, just southwest of Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Lookout Mountain is not much of a mountain. It resembles an impossibly high and commanding hill, brown from a distance, green with trees and houses from up close. The Chickamauga, a branch of the Cherokee, lived there when the white men came; they called the mountain Chattotonoogee, which has been translated as the mountain that rises to a point.
In the 1830s Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act forced them all from their land-all the Choctaw and Chickamauga and Cherokee and Chickasaw-and U.S. troops forced every one of them they could find and catch to walk over a thousand miles to the new Indian Territories in what would one day be Oklahoma, down the Trail of Tears: a cheerful gesture of casual genocide. Thousands of men, women, and children died on the way. When you've won, you've won, and nobody can argue with that.
For whoever controlled Lookout Mountain controlled the land; that was the legend. It was a sacred site, after all, and it was a high place. In the Civil War, the War Between the States, there was a battle there: the Battle Above the Clouds, that was the first day's fighting, and then the Union forces did the impossible, and, without orders, swept up Missionary Ridge and took it. The troops of General Grant won the day, and the North took Lookout Mountain and the North took the war.
There are tunnels and caves, some very old, beneath Lookout Mountain. For the most part they are blocked off now, although a local businessman excavated an underground waterfall, which he called Ruby Falls. It can be reached by elevator. It's a tourist attraction, although the biggest tourist attraction of all is at the top of Lookout Mountain. That is Rock City.
Rock City begins as an ornamental garden on a mountainside: its visitors walk a path that takes them through rocks, over rocks, between rocks. They throw corn into a deer enclosure, cross a hanging bridge and peer out through a-quarter-a-throw binoculars at a view that promises them seven states on the rare sunny days when the air is perfectly clear. And from there, like a drop into some strange hell, the path takes the visitors, millions upon millions of them every year, down into caverns, where they stare at black-lit dolls arranged into nursery-rhyme and fairy-tale dioramas. When they leave, they leave bemused, uncertain of why they came, of what they have seen, of whether they had a good time or not.
  
They came to Lookout Mountain from all across the United States. They were not tourists. They came by car and they came by plane and by bus and by railroad and on foot. Some of them flew-they flew low, and they flew only in the dark of the night, but still, they flew. Several of them traveled their own ways beneath the earth. Many of them hitchhiked, cadging rides from nervous motorists or from truck drivers. Those who had cars or trucks would see the ones who had not walking beside the roads or at rest stations and in diners on the way, and, recognizing them for what they were, would offer them rides.
They arrived dust-stained and weary at the foot of Lookout Mountain. Looking up to the heights of the tree-covered slope they could see, or imagine that they could see, the paths and gardens and streams of Rock City.
They started arriving early in the morning. A second wave of them arrived at dusk. And for several days they simply kept coming.
A battered U-Haul truck pulled up, disgorging several travel-weary vila and rusalka, their make-up smudged, runs in their stockings, their expressions heavy-lidded and tired.
In a clump of trees at the bottom of the hill, an elderly wampyr offered a Marlboro to a huge naked ape-like creature covered with a tangle of orange fur. It accepted graciously, and they smoked in silence, side by side.
A Toyota Previa pulled up by the side of the road, and seven Chinese men and women got out of it. They looked, above all, clean, and they wore the kind of dark suits that, in some countries, are worn by minor government officials. One of them carried a clipboard, and he checked the inventory as they unloaded large golf-bags from the back of the car: the bags contained ornate swords with lacquer handles, and carved sticks, and mirrors. The weapons were distributed, checked off, signed for.
A once-famous comedian, believed to have died in the 1920s, climbed out of his rusting car, and proceeded to remove his clothing: his legs were goat-legs, and his tail was short and goatish.
Four Mexicans arrived, all smiles, their hair black and very shiny: they passed among themselves a beer bottle which they kept out of sight in a brown paper bag, its contents a bitter mixture of powdered chocolate, liquor, and blood.
A small, dark-bearded man with a dusty black derby on his head, curling payess at his temples, and a ragged fringed prayer shawl came to them walking across the fields. He was several feet in front of his companion, who was twice his height and was the blank gray color of good Polish clay: the word inscribed on his forehead meant truth.
They kept coming. A cab drew up and several rakshasas, the demons of the Indian subcontinent, climbed out and milled around, staring at the people at the bottom of the hill without speaking, until they found Mama-ji, her eyes closed, her lips moving in prayer. She was the only thing here that was familiar to them, but still, they hesitated to approach her, remembering old battles. Her hands rubbed the necklace of skulls about her neck. Her brown skin became slowly black, the glassy black of jet, of obsidian: her lips curled and her long white teeth were very sharp. She opened all her eyes, and beckoned the rakshasas to her, and greeted them as she would have greeted her own children.
The storms of the last few days, to the north and the east, had done nothing to ease the feeling of pressure and discomfort in the air. Local weather forecasters had begun to warn of cells that might spawn tornados, of high-pressure areas that did not move. It was warm by day there, but the nights were cold.
They clumped together in informal companies, banding together sometimes by nationality, by race, by temperament, even by species. They looked apprehensive. They looked tired.
Some of them were talking. There was laughter, on occasion, but it was muted and sporadic. Six-packs of beer were handed around.
Several local men and women came walking over the meadows, their bodies moving in unfamiliar ways: their voices, when they spoke, were the voices of the loa who rode them: a tall, black man spoke in the voice of Papa Legba who opens the gates; while Baron Samedi, the voudon lord of death, had taken over the body of a teenage Goth girl from Chattanooga, possibly because she possessed her own black silk top hat, which sat on her dark hair at a jaunty angle. She spoke in the baron's own deep voice, smoked a cigar of enormous size, and commanded three of the Gédé, the Loa of the dead. The Gédé inhabited the bodies of three middle-aged brothers. They carried shotguns and told continual jokes of such astounding filthiness that only they were willing to laugh at them, which they did, raucously and repeatedly.
Two ageless Chickamauga women, in oil-stained blue jeans and battered leather jackets, walked around, watching the people and the preparations for battle. Sometimes they pointed and laughed; they did not intend to take part in the coming conflict.
The moon swelled and rose in the east, a day away from full. It seemed half as big as the sky as it rose, a deep reddish-orange, immediately above the hills. As it crossed the sky it seemed to shrink and pale until it hung high in the sky like a lantern.
There were so many of them waiting there, in the moonlight, at the foot of Lookout Mountain.
  
Laura was thirsty.
Sometimes living people burned steadily in her mind like candles and sometimes they flamed like torches. It made them easy to avoid, and it made them easy, on occasion, to find. Shadow had burned so strangely, with his own light, up on that tree.
She had chided him once, on that day when they had walked and held hands, for not being alive. She had hoped, perhaps, to see a spark of raw emotion, something that would show her that the man she had once been married to was a real man, a live one. And she had seen nothing at all.
She remembered walking beside him, wishing that he could understand what she was trying to say.
Now, dying on the tree, Shadow was utterly alive. She had watched him as the life had faded, and he had been focused and real. And he had asked her to stay with him, to stay the whole night. He had forgiven her...perhaps he had forgiven her. It did not matter. He had changed; that was all she knew.
Shadow had told her to go to the farmhouse, that they would give her water to drink there. There were no lights burning in the farm building, and she could feel nobody at home. But he had told her that they would care for her. She pushed against the door of the farmhouse and it opened, rusty hinges protesting the whole while.
Something moved in her left lung, something that pushed and squirmed and made her cough.
She found herself in a narrow hallway, her way almost blocked by a tall and dusty piano. The inside of the building smelled of old damp. She squeezed past the piano, pushed open a door and found herself in a dilapidated drawing room, filled with ramshackle furniture. An oil lamp burned on the mantelpiece. There was a coal fire burning in the fireplace beneath it, although she had neither seen nor smelled smoke outside the house. The coal fire did nothing to lift the chill she felt in that room, although, Laura was willing to concede, that might not be the fault of the room.
Death hurt Laura, although the hurt consisted mostly of absences, of things that were not there: a parching thirst that drained every cell of her, a cold in her bones that no heat could lift. Sometimes she would catch herself wondering whether the crisp and crackling flames of a pyre would warm her, or the soft brown blanket of the earth; whether the cold sea would quench her thirst...
The room, she realized, was not empty.
Three women sat on an elderly couch, as if they had come as a matched set in some outlandish artistic exhibition. The couch was upholstered in threadbare velvet, a faded brown that might, once, a hundred years ago, have been a bright canary yellow. The women were dressed in identical fog-gray skirts and sweaters. Their eyes were too deeply set, their skin the white of fresh bone. The one on the left of the sofa was a giantess, or almost, the one on the right was little more than a dwarf, and, between them, was a woman Laura was certain would be her own height. They followed her with their eyes as she entered the room, and they said nothing.
Laura had not known they would be there.
Something wriggled and fell in her nasal cavity. Laura fumbled in her sleeve for a tissue, and she blew her nose into it. She crumpled the tissue and flung it and its contents onto the coals of the fire, watched it crumple and blacken and become orange lace. She watched the maggots shrivel and brown and burn.
This done, she turned back to the women on the couch. They had not moved since she had entered, not a muscle, not a hair. They stared at her.
""Hello. Is this your farm?"" she asked.
The largest of the women nodded. Her hands were very red, and her expression was impassive.
""Shadow-that's the guy hanging on the tree. He's my husband. He said I should tell you that he wants you to give me water."" Something large shifted in her bowels. It squirmed, and then was still.
The smallest woman nodded. She clambered off the couch. Her feet had not previously touched the floor. She scurried from the room.
Laura could hear doors opening and closing, through the farmhouse. Then, from outside, she could hear a series of loud creaks. Each was followed by a splash of water.
Soon enough, the small woman returned. She was carrying a brown earthenware jug of water. She put it down, carefully, on the table, and retreated to the couch. She pulled herself up, with a wriggle and a shiver, and was seated beside her sisters once again.
""Thank you."" Laura walked over to the table, looked around for a cup or a glass, but there was nothing like that to be seen. She picked up the jug. It was heavier than it looked. The water in it was perfectly clear.
She raised the jug to her lips and began to drink.
The water was colder than she had ever imagined liquid water could be. It froze her tongue and her teeth and her gullet. Still, she drank, unable to stop drinking, feeling the water freezing its way into her stomach, her bowels, her heart, her veins.
The water flowed into her. It was like drinking liquid ice.
She realized that the jug was empty and, surprised, she put it down on the table.
The women were observing her, dispassionately. Since her death, Laura had not thought in metaphors: things were, or they were not. But now, as she looked at the women on the sofa, she found herself thinking of juries, of scientists observing a laboratory animal.
She shook, suddenly and convulsively. She reached out a hand to the table to steady herself, but the table was slipping and lurching, and it almost avoided her grasp. As she put her hand on the table she began to vomit. She brought up bile and formalin, centipedes, and maggots. And then she felt herself starting to void, and to piss: stuff was being pushed violently, wetly, from her body. She would have screamed if she could; but then the dusty floorboards came up to meet her so fast and so hard that, had she been breathing, they would have knocked the breath from her body.
Time rushed over her and into her, swirling like a dust-devil. A thousand memories began to play at once: she was wet and stinking on the floor of the farmhouse; and she was lost in a department store the week before Christmas and her father was nowhere to be seen; and now she was sitting in the bar at Chi-Chi's, ordering a strawberry daiquiri and checking out her blind date, the big, grave man-child, and wondering how he kissed; and she was in the car as, sickeningly, it rolled and jolted, and Robbie was screaming at her until the metal post finally stopped the car, but not its contents, from moving...
The water of time, which comes from the spring of fate, Urd's Well, is not the water of life. Not quite. It feeds the roots of the world tree, though. And there is no other water like it.
When Laura woke in the empty farmhouse room, she was shivering, and her breath actually steamed in the morning air. There was a scrape on the back of her hand, and a wet smear on the scrape, the red-orange of fresh blood.
And she knew where she had to go. She had drunk from the water of time, which comes from the spring of fate. She could see the mountain in her mind. She licked the blood from the back of her hand, marveling at the film of saliva, and she began to walk.
  
It was a wet March day, and it was unseasonably cold, and the storms of the previous few days had lashed their way across the southern states, which meant that there were very few real tourists at Rock City on Lookout Mountain. The Christmas lights had been taken down, the summer visitors were yet to start arriving.
Still, there were a number of people there. There was even a tour bus that drew up that morning, releasing a dozen men and women with perfect tans and gleaming, reassuring smiles. They looked like news anchors, and one could almost imagine there was a phosphor-dot quality to them: they seemed to blur gently as they moved. A black Humvee was parked in the front lot of Rock City, near to Rocky the animatronic gnome.
The TV people walked intently through Rock City, stationing themselves near the balancing rock, where they talked to each other in pleasant, reasonable voices.
They were not the only visitors. If you had walked the paths of Rock City that day, you might have noticed people who looked like movie stars, and people who looked like aliens and a number of people who looked most of all like the idea of a person and nothing like the reality. You might have seen them, but most likely you would never have noticed them at all.
They came to Rock City in long limousines and in small sports cars and in oversized SUVs. Many of them wore the sunglasses of those who habitually wear sunglasses indoors and out, and do not willingly or comfortably remove them. There were suntans and suits and shades and smiles and scowls. They came in all sizes and shapes, all ages and styles.
All they had in common was a look, a very specific look. It said, You know me; or perhaps, You ought to know me. An instant familiarity that was also a distance, a look, or an attitude-the confidence that the world existed for them, and that it welcomed them, and that they were adored.
The fat kid moved among them with the shuffling walk of one who, despite having no social skills, has still become successful beyond his dreams. His black coat flapped in the wind.
Something that stood beside the soft drink stand in Mother Goose Court coughed to attract his attention. It was massive, and scalpel-blades jutted from its face and its fingers. Its face was cancerous. ""It will be a mighty battle,"" it told him, in a glutinous voice.
""It's not going to be a battle,"" said the fat kid. ""All we're facing here is a fucking paradigm shift. It's a shakedown. Modalities like battle are so fucking Lao Tzu.""
The cancerous thing blinked at him. ""Waiting,"" is all it said in reply.
""Whatever,"" said the fat kid. Then, ""I'm looking for Mister World. You seen him?""
The thing scratched itself with a scalpel-blade, a tumorous lower lip pushed out in concentration. Then it nodded. ""Over there,"" it said.
The fat kid walked away, without a thank-you, in the direction indicated. The cancerous thing waited, saying nothing, until the kid was out of sight.
""It will be a battle,"" said the cancerous thing to a woman whose face was smudged with phosphor-dots.
She nodded, and leaned closer to it. ""So how does that make you feel?"" she asked, in a sympathetic voice.
It blinked, and then it began to tell her.
  
Town's Ford Explorer had a global positioning system, a little silver box that listened to the satellites and whispered back to the car its location, but he still got lost once he got south of Blacksburg and onto the country roads: the roads he drove seemed to bear little relationship to the tangle of lines on the map on the screen. Eventually he stopped the car in a country lane, wound down the window and asked a fat white woman being pulled by a wolfhound on its early morning walk for directions to Ashtree farm.
She nodded, and pointed and said something to him. He could not understand what she had said, but he said thanks a million and wound up the window and drove off in the general direction she had indicated.
He kept going for another forty minutes, down country road after country road, each of them promising, none of them the road he sought. Town began to chew his lower lip.
""I'm too old for this shit,"" he said aloud, relishing the movie-star world-weariness of the line.
He was pushing fifty. Most of his working life had been spent in a branch of government which went only by its initials, and whether or not he had left his government job a dozen years ago for employment by the private sector was a matter of opinion: some days he thought one way, some days another. Anyway, it was only when you got down to the joes on the street that anyone seemed to assume there was a difference.
He was on the verge of giving up on the farm when he drove up a hill and saw the sign, hand painted, on the gate. It said simply, as he had been told it would, ASH. He pulled up the Ford Explorer, climbed out and untwisted the wire that held the gate closed. He got back in the car and drove through.
It was like cooking a frog, he thought. You put the frog in the water, and then you turn on the heat. And by the time the frog notices that there's anything wrong, it's already been cooked. The world in which he worked was all too weird. There was no solid ground beneath his feet; the water in the pot was bubbling fiercely.
When he'd been transferred to the Agency it had all seemed so simple. Now it was all so-not complex, he decided; merely bizarre. He had been sitting in Mr. World's office at two that morning, and he had been told what he was to do. ""You got it?"" said Mr. World, handing him the knife in its dark leather sheath. ""Cut me a stick. It doesn't have to be longer than a couple of feet.""
""Affirmative,"" he said. And then he said, ""Why do I have to do this, sir?""
""Because I tell you to,"" said Mr. World, flatly. ""Find the tree. Do the job. Meet me down in Chattanooga. Don't waste any time.""
""And what about the asshole?""
""Shadow? If you see him, just avoid him. Don't touch him. Don't even mess with him. I don't want you turning him into a martyr. There's no room for martyrs in the current game-plan."" He smiled then, his scarred smile. Mr. World was easily amused. Mr. Town had noticed this on several occasions. It had amused him to play chauffeur, in Kansas, after all.
""Look-""
""No martyrs, Town.""
And Town had nodded, and taken the knife in its sheath, and pushed the rage that welled up inside him down deep and away.
Mr. Town's hatred of Shadow had become a part of him. As he was falling asleep he would see Shadow's solemn face, see that smile that wasn't a smile, the way Shadow had of smiling without smiling that made Town want to sink his fist into the man's gut, and even as he fell asleep he could feel his jaws squeeze together, his temples tense, his gullet burn.
He drove the Ford Explorer across the meadow, past an abandoned farmhouse. He crested a ridge and saw the tree. He parked the car a little way past it, and turned off the engine. The clock on the dashboard said it was 6:38 A.M. He left the keys in the car, and walked toward the tree.
The tree was large; it seemed to exist on its own sense of scale. Town could not have said if it was fifty feet high or two hundred. Its bark was the gray of a fine silk scarf.
There was a naked man tied to the trunk a little way above the ground by a webwork of ropes, and there was something wrapped in a sheet at the foot of the tree. Town realized what it was as he passed it. He pushed at the sheet with his foot. Wednesday's ruined half-a-face stared out at him. He would have expected it to be alive with maggots and flies, but it was untouched by insects. It didn't even smell bad. It looked just as it had when he had taken it to the motel.
Town reached the tree. He walked a little way around the thick trunk, away from the sightless eyes of the farmhouse, then he unzipped his fly and pissed against the trunk of the tree. He did up his fly. He walked back over to the house, found a wooden extension ladder, carried it back to the tree. He leaned it carefully against the trunk. Then he climbed up it.
Shadow hung, limply, from the ropes that tied him to the tree. Town wondered if the man were still alive: his chest did not rise or fall. Dead or almost dead, it did not matter.
""Hello, asshole,"" Town said, aloud. Shadow did not move.
Town reached the top of the ladder, and he pulled out the knife. He found a small branch which seemed to meet Mr. World's specifications, and hacked at the base of it with the knife-blade, cutting it half-through, then breaking it off with his hand. It was about thirty inches long.
He put the knife back in its sheath. Then he started to climb back down the ladder. When he was opposite Shadow, he paused. ""God, I hate you,"" he said. He wished he could just have taken out a gun and shot him, and he knew that he could not. And then he jabbed the stick in the air toward the hanging man, in a stabbing motion. It was an instinctive gesture, containing all the frustration and rage inside Town. He imagined that he was holding a spear and twisting it into Shadow's guts.
""Come on,"" he said, aloud. ""Time to get moving."" Then he thought, First sign of madness. Talking to yourself. He climbed down a few more steps, then jumped the rest of the way to the ground. He looked at the stick he was holding, and felt like a small boy, holding his stick as a sword or a spear. I could have cut a stick from any tree, he thought. It didn't have to be this tree. Who the fuck would have known?
And he thought, Mr. World would have known.
He carried the ladder back to the farmhouse. From the corner of his eye he thought he saw something move, and he looked in through the window, into the dark room filled with broken furniture, with the plaster peeling from the walls, and for a moment, in a half-dream, he imagined that he saw three women sitting in the dark parlor.
One of them was knitting. One of them was staring directly at him. One of them appeared to be asleep. The woman who was staring at him began to smile, a huge smile that seemed to split her face lengthwise, a smile that crossed from ear to ear. Then she raised a finger and touched it to her neck, and ran it gently from one side of her neck to the other.
That was what he thought he saw, all in a moment, in that empty room, which contained, he saw at a second glance, nothing more than old rotting furniture and fly-spotted prints and dry rot. There was nobody there at all.
He rubbed his eyes.
Town walked back to the brown Ford Explorer and climbed in. He tossed the stick onto the white leather of the passenger seat. He turned the key in the ignition. The dashboard clock said 6:37 A.M. Town frowned, and checked his wristwatch, which blinked that it was 13:58.
Great, he thought. I was either up on that tree for eight hours, or for minus a minute. That was what he thought, but what he believed was that both timepieces had, coincidentally, begun to misbehave.
On the tree, Shadow's body began to bleed. The wound was in his side. The blood that came from it was slow and thick and molasses-black.
He did not move. If he was sleeping, he did not wake.
  
Clouds covered the top of Lookout Mountain.
Easter sat some distance away from the crowd at the bottom of the mountain, watching the dawn over the hills to the east. She had a chain of blue forget-me-nots tattooed around her left wrist, and she rubbed them, absently, with her right thumb.
Another night had come and gone, and nothing. The folk were still coming, by ones and twos. The last night had brought several creatures from the southwest, including two young boys each the size of an apple tree, and something which she had only glimpsed, but which had looked like a disembodied head the size of a VW Bug. They had disappeared into the trees at the base of the mountain.
Nobody bothered them. Nobody from the outside world even seemed to have noticed they were there: she imagined the tourists at Rock City staring down at them through their insert-a-quarter binoculars, staring straight at a ramshackle encampment of things and people at the foot of the mountain, and seeing nothing but trees and bushes and rocks.
She could smell the smoke from a cooking fire, a smell of burning bacon on the chilly dawn wind. Someone at the far end of the encampment began to play the harmonica, which made her, involuntarily, smile and shiver. She had a paperback book in her backpack, and she waited for the sky to become light enough for her to read.
There were two dots in the sky, immediately below the clouds: a small one and a larger one. A spatter of rain brushed her face in the morning wind.
A barefoot girl came out from the encampment, walking toward her. She stopped beside a tree, hitched up her skirts, and squatted. When she had finished, Easter hailed her. The girl walked over.
""Good morning, lady,"" she said. ""The battle will start soon now."" The tip of her pink tongue touched her scarlet lips. She had a black crow's wing tied with leather onto her shoulder, a crow's foot on a chain around her neck. Her arms were blue-tattooed with lines and patterns and intricate knots.
""How do you know?""
The girl grinned. ""I am Macha, of the Morrigan. When war comes, I can smell it in the air. I am a war goddess, and I say, blood shall be spilled this day.""
""Oh,"" said Easter. ""Well. There you go."" She was watching the smaller dot in the sky as it tumbled down toward them, dropping like a rock.
""And we shall fight them, and we shall kill them, every one,"" said the girl. ""And we shall take their heads as trophies, and the crows shall have their eyes and their corpses."" The dot had become a bird, its wings outstretched, riding the gusty morning winds above them.
Easter cocked her head on one side. ""Is that some hidden war goddess knowledge?"" she asked. ""The whole 'who's going to win' thing? Who gets whose head?""
""No,"" said the girl. ""I can smell the battle, but that's all. But we'll win. Won't we? We have to. I saw what they did to the all-father. It's them or us.""
""Yeah,"" said Easter. ""I suppose it is.""
The girl smiled again, in the half-light, and made her way back to the camp. Easter put her hand down and touched a green shoot which stabbed up from the earth like a knife blade. As she touched it it grew, and opened, and twisted, and changed, until she was resting her hand on a green tulip head. When the sun was high the flower would open.
Easter looked up at the hawk. ""Can I help you?"" she said.
The hawk circled about fifteen feet above Easter's head, slowly, then it glided down to her, and landed on the ground nearby. It looked up at her with mad eyes.
""Hello, cutie,"" she said. ""Now, what do you really look like, eh?""
The hawk hopped toward her, uncertainly, and then it was no longer a hawk, but a young man. He looked at her, and then looked down at the grass. ""You?"" he said. His glance went everywhere, to the grass, to the sky, to the bushes. Not to her.
""Me,"" she said. ""What about me?""
""You."" He stopped. He seemed to be trying to muster his thoughts; strange expressions flitted and swam across his face. He spent too long a bird, she thought. He has forgotten how to be a man. She waited patiently. Eventually, he said, ""Will you come with me?""
""Maybe. Where do you want me to go?""
""The man on the tree. He needs you. A ghost hurt, in his side. The blood came, then it stopped. I think he is dead.""
""There's a war on. I can't just go running away.""
The naked man said nothing, just moved from one foot to another as if he were uncertain of his weight, as if he were used to resting on the air or on a swaying branch, not on the solid and unchanging earth. Then he said, ""If he is gone forever, it is all over.""
""But the battle-""
""If he is lost, it will not matter who wins."" He looked like he needed a blanket, and a cup of sweet coffee, and someone to take him somewhere he could shiver and babble until he got his mind back. He held his arms stiffly against his sides.
""Where is this? Nearby?""
He stared at the tulip plant, and shook his head. ""Way away.""
""Well,"" she said, ""I'm needed here. And I can't just leave. How do you expect me to get there? I can't fly, like you, you know.""
""No,"" said Horus. ""You can't."" Then he looked up, gravely, and pointed to the other dot that circled them, as it dropped from the darkening clouds, growing in size. ""He can.""
  
Another several hours' pointless driving, and by now Town hated the GPS almost as much as he hated Shadow. There was no passion in the hate, though. He had thought finding his way to the farm, to the great silver ash tree, had been hard; finding his way away from the farm was much harder. It did not seem to matter which road he took, which direction he drove down the narrow country lanes-the twisting Virginia back roads which must have begun, he was sure, as deer trails and cow paths-eventually he would find himself passing the farm once more, and the hand-painted sign, ASH.
This was crazy, wasn't it? He simply had to retrace his way, take a left turn for every right he had taken on his way here, a right turn for every left.
Only that was what he had done last time, and now here he was, back at the farm once more. There were heavy storm clouds coming in, it was getting dark fast, it felt like night, not morning, and he had a long drive ahead of him: he would never get to Chattanooga before afternoon at this rate.
His cell phone gave him only a No Service message. The fold-out map in the car's glove compartment showed the main roads, all the interstates and the real highways, but as far as it was concerned nothing else existed.
Nor was there anyone around that he could ask. The houses were set back from the roads; there were no welcoming lights. Now the fuel gauge was nudging Empty. He heard a rumble of distant thunder, and a single drop of rain splashed heavily onto his windshield.
So when Town saw the woman walking along the side of the road, he found himself smiling, involuntarily. ""Thank God,"" he said, aloud, and he drew up beside her. He thumbed down her window. ""Ma'am? I'm sorry. I'm kind of lost. Can you tell me how to get to Highway 81 from here?""
She looked at him through the open passenger-side window and said, ""You know, I don't think I can explain it. But I can show you, if you like."" She was pale and her wet hair was long and dark.
""Climb in,"" said Town. He didn't even hesitate. ""First thing, we need to buy some gas.""
""Thanks,"" she said. ""I needed a ride."" She got in. Her eyes were astonishingly blue. ""There's a stick here, on the seat,"" she said, puzzled.
""Just throw it in the back. Where are you heading?"" he asked. ""Lady, if you can get me to a gas station, and back to a freeway, I'll take you all the way to your own front door.""
She said, ""Thank you. But I think I'm going further than you are. If you can get me to the freeway, that will be fine. Maybe a trucker will give me a ride."" And she smiled, a crooked, determined smile. It was the smile that did it.
""Ma'am,"" he said, ""I can give you a finer ride than any trucker."" He could smell her perfume. It was heady and heavy, a cloying scent, like magnolias or lilacs, but he did not mind.
""I'm going to Georgia,"" she said. ""It's a long way.""
""I'm going to Chattanooga. I'll take you as far as I can.""
""Mmm,"" she said. ""What's your name?""
""They call me Mack,"" said Mr. Town. When he was talking to women in bars, he would sometimes follow that up with ""And the ones that know me really well call me Big Mack."" That could wait. They would have many hours in each other's company to get to know each other, after all. ""What's yours?""
""Laura,"" she told him.
""Well, Laura,"" he said, ""I'm sure we're going to be great friends.""
  
The fat kid found Mr. World in the Rainbow Room-a walled section of the path, its window glass covered in clear plastic sheets of green and red and yellow film. He was walking impatiently from window to window, staring out, in turn, at a golden world, a red world, a green world. His hair was reddish-orange and close-cropped to his skull. He wore a Burberry raincoat.
The fat kid coughed. Mr. World looked up.
""Excuse me? Mister World?""
""Yes? Is everything on schedule?""
The fat kid's mouth was dry. He licked his lips, and said, ""I've set up everything. I don't have confirmation on the choppers.""
""The helicopters will be here when we need them.""
""Good,"" said the fat kid. ""Good."" He stood there, not saying anything, not going away. There was a bruise on his forehead.
After a while Mr. World said, ""Is there anything else I can do for you?""
A pause. The boy swallowed and nodded. ""Something else,"" he said. ""Yes.""
""Would you feel more comfortable discussing it in private?""
The boy nodded again.
Mr. World walked with the kid back to his operations center: a damp cave containing a diorama of drunken pixies making moonshine with a still. A sign outside warned tourists away during renovations. The two men sat down on plastic chairs.
""How can I help you?"" asked Mr. World.
""Yes. Okay. Right, two things, Okay. One. What are we waiting for? And two. Two is harder. Look. We have the guns. Right. We have the firepower. They have fucking swords and knives and fucking hammers and stone axes. And like, tire irons. We have fucking smart bombs.""
""Which we will not be using,"" pointed out the other man.
""I know that. You said that already. I know that. And that's doable. But. Look, ever since I did the job on that bitch in L.A. I've been..."" He stopped, made a face, seemed unwilling to go on.
""You've been troubled?""
""Yes. Good word. Troubled. Yes. Like a home for troubled teens. Funny. Yes.""
""And what exactly is troubling you?""
""Well, we fight, we win.""
""And that is a source of trouble? I find it a matter of triumph and delight, myself.""
""But. They'll die out anyway. They are passenger pigeons and thylacines. Yes? Who cares? This way, it's going to be a bloodbath. If we just wait them out, we get the whole thing.""
""Ah."" Mr. World nodded.
He was following. That was good. The fat kid said, ""Look, I'm not the only one who feels this way. I've checked with the crew at Radio Modern, and they're all for settling this peacefully; and the Intangibles are pretty much in favor of letting market forces take care of it. I'm being. You know. The voice of reason here.""
""You are indeed. Unfortunately, there is information you do not have."" The smile that followed was twisted and scarred.
The boy blinked. He said, ""Mister World? What happened to your lips?""
World sighed. ""The truth of the matter,"" he said, ""is that somebody sewed them together. A long time ago.""
""Whoa,"" said the fat kid. ""Serious omertà shit.""
""Yes. You want to know what we're waiting for? Why we didn't strike last night?""
The fat kid nodded. He was sweating, but it was a cold sweat.
""We didn't strike yet, because I'm waiting for a stick.""
""A stick?""
""That's right. A stick. And do you know what I'm going to do with the stick?""
A head shake. ""Okay. I'll bite. What?""
""I could tell you,"" said Mr. World, soberly. ""But then I'd have to kill you."" He winked, and the tension in the room evaporated.
The fat kid began to giggle, a low, snuffling laugh in the back of his throat and in his nose. ""Okay,"" he said. ""Hee. Hee. Okay. Hee. Got it. Message received on Planet Technical. Loud and clear. Ixnay on the estionsquay.""
Mr. World shook his head. He rested a hand on the fat kid's shoulder. ""Hey,"" he said. ""You really want to know?""
""Sure.""
""Well,"" said Mr. World, ""seeing that we're friends, here's the answer: I'm going to take the stick, and I'm going to throw it over the armies as they come together. As I throw it, it will become a spear. And then, as the spear arcs over the battle, I'm going to shout, 'I dedicate this battle to Odin.'""
""Huh?"" said the fat kid. ""Why?""
""Power,"" said Mr. World. He scratched his chin. ""And food. A combination of the two. You see, the outcome of the battle is unimportant. What matters is the chaos, and the slaughter.""
""I don't get it.""
""Let me show you. It'll be just like this,"" said Mr. World. ""Watch!"" He took the wooden-bladed hunter's knife from the pocket of his Burberry and, in one fluid movement, he slipped the blade of it into the soft flesh beneath the fat kid's chin, and pushed hard upward, toward the brain. ""I dedicate this death to Odin,"" he said, as the knife sank in.
There was a leakage onto his hand of something that was not actually blood, and a sputtering sparking noise behind the fat kid's eyes. The smell on the air was that of burning insulation wire, as if somewhere a plug was overloading.
The fat kid's hand twitched spastically, and then he fell. The expression on his face was one of puzzlement, and misery. ""Look at him,"" said Mr. World, conversationally, to the air. ""He looks as if he just saw a sequence of zeroes and ones turn into a cluster of brightly colored birds, and then just fly away.""
There was no reply from the empty rock corridor.
Mr. World shouldered the body as if it weighed very little, and he opened the pixie diorama and dropped the body beside the still, covering it with its long black raincoat. He would dispose of it that evening, he decided, and he grinned his scarred grin: hiding a body on a battlefield would almost be too easy. Nobody would ever notice. Nobody would care.
For a little while there was silence in that place. And then a gruff voice which was not Mr. World's cleared its throat in the shadows, and said, ""Good start.""

He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him
How that could be-I thought the dead were souls,
He broke my trance. Don't that make you suspicious
That there's something the dead are keeping back?
Yes, there's something the dead are keeping back.
-ROBERT FROST, ""TWO WITCHES"" 
The week before Christmas is often a quiet one in a funeral parlor, Shadow learned, over supper. Mr. Ibis explained it to him. ""The lingering ones are holding on for one final Christmas,"" said Mr. Ibis, ""or even for New Year's, while the others, the ones for whom other people's jollity and celebration will prove too painful, have not yet been tipped over the edge by that last showing of It's a Wonderful Life, have not quite encountered the final straw, or should I say, the final sprig of holly that breaks not the camel's but the reindeer's back."" And he made a little noise as he said it, half smirk, half snort, which suggested that he had just uttered a well-honed phrase of which he was particularly fond.
Ibis and Jacquel was a small, family-owned funeral home: one of the last truly independent funeral homes in the area, or so Mr. Ibis maintained. ""Most fields of human merchandising value nationwide brand identities,"" he said. Mr. Ibis spoke in explanations: a gentle, earnest lecturing that put Shadow in mind of a college professor who used to work out at the Muscle Farm and who could not talk, could only discourse, expound, explain. Shadow had figured out within the first few minutes of meeting Mr. Ibis that his expected part in any conversation with the funeral director was to say as little as possible. They were sitting in a small restaurant, two blocks from Ibis and Jacquel's funeral home. Shadow's supper consisted of an all-day full breakfast-it came with hush puppies-while Mr. Ibis picked and pecked at a slice of coffeecake. ""This, I believe, is because people like to know what they are getting ahead of time. Thus McDonald's, Wal-Mart, F. W. Woolworth (of blessed memory): store-brands maintained and visible across the entire country. Wherever you go, you will get something that is, with small regional variations, the same.
""In the field of funeral homes, however, things are, perforce, different. You need to feel that you are getting small-town personal service from someone who has a calling to the profession. You want personal attention to you and your loved one in a time of great loss. You wish to know that your grief is happening on a local level, not on a national one. But in all branches of industry-and death is an industry, my young friend, make no mistake about that-one makes one's money from operating in bulk, from buying in quantity, from centralizing one's operations. It's not pretty, but it's true. Trouble is, no one wants to know that their loved ones are traveling in a cooler-van to some big old converted warehouse where they may have twenty, fifty, a hundred cadavers on the go. No, sir. Folks want to think they're going to a family concern, somewhere they'll be treated with respect by someone who'll tip his hat to them if he sees them in the street.""
Mr. Ibis wore a hat. It was a sober brown hat that matched his sober brown blazer and his sober brown face. Small gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. In Shadow's memory Mr. Ibis was a short man; whenever he would stand beside him, Shadow would rediscover that Mr. Ibis was well over six feet in height, with a crane-like stoop.
""So when the big companies come in they buy the name of the company, they pay the funeral directors to stay on, they create the apparency of diversity. But that is merely the tip of the gravestone. In reality, they are as local as Burger King. Now, for our own reasons, we are truly an independent. We do all our own embalming, and it's the finest embalming in the country, although nobody knows it but us. We don't do cremations, though. We could make more money if we had our own crematorium, but it goes against what we're good at. What my business partner says is, if the Lord gives you a talent or a skill, you have an obligation to use it as best you can. Don't you agree?""
""Sounds good to me,"" said Shadow.
""The Lord gave my business partner dominion over the dead, just as he gave me skill with words. Fine things, words. I write books of tales, you know. Nothing literary. Just for my own amusement. Accounts of lives."" He paused. By the time Shadow realized that he should have asked if he might be allowed to read one, the moment had passed. ""Anyway, what we give them here is continuity: there's been an Ibis and Jacquel in business here for almost two hundred years. We weren't always funeral directors, though. We used to be morticians, and before that, undertakers.""
""And before that?""
""Well,"" said Mr. Ibis, smiling just a little smugly, ""we go back a very long way. Of course, it wasn't until after the War Between the States that we found our niche here. That was when we became the funeral parlor for the colored folks hereabouts. Before that no one thought of us as colored-foreign maybe, exotic and dark, but not colored. Once the war was done, pretty soon, no one could remember a time when we weren't perceived as black. My business partner, he's always had darker skin than mine. It was an easy transition. Mostly you are what they think you are. It's just strange when they talk about African-Americans. Makes me think of the people from Punt, Ophir, Nubia. We never thought of ourselves as Africans-we were the people of the Nile.""
""So you were Egyptians,"" said Shadow.
Mr. Ibis pushed his lower lip upward, then let his head bob from side to side, as if it were on a spring, weighing the pluses and minuses, seeing things from both points of view. ""Well, yes and no. 'Egyptians' makes me think of the folk who live there now. The ones who built their cities over our graveyards and palaces. Do they look like me?""
Shadow shrugged. He'd seen black guys who looked like Mr. Ibis. He'd seen white guys with tans who looked like Mr. Ibis.
""How was your coffee-cake?"" asked the waitress, refilling their coffees.
""Best I ever had,"" said Mr. Ibis. ""You give my best to your ma.""
""I'll do that,"" she said, and bustled away.
""You don't want to ask after the health of anyone, if you're a funeral director. They think maybe you're scouting for business,"" said Mr. Ibis, in an undertone. ""Shall we see if your room is ready?""
Their breath steamed in the night air. Christmas lights twinkled in the windows of the stores they passed. ""It's good of you, putting me up,"" said Shadow. ""I appreciate it.""
""We owe your employer a number of favors. And Lord knows, we have the room. It's a big old house. There used to be more of us, you know. Now it's just the three of us. You won't be in the way.""
""Any idea how long I'm meant to stay with you?""
Mr. Ibis shook his head. ""He didn't say. But we are happy to have you here, and we can find you work. If you are not squeamish. If you treat the dead with respect.""
""So,"" asked Shadow, ""what are you people doing here in Cairo? Was it just the name or something?""
""No. Not at all. Actually this region takes its names from us, although people barely know it. It was a trading post back in the old days.""
""Frontier times?""
""You might call it that,"" said Mr. Ibis. ""Evening, Mizz Simmons! And a merry Christmas to you too! The folk who brought me here came up the Mississippi a long time back.""
Shadow stopped in the street, and stared. ""Are you trying to tell me that ancient Egyptians came here to trade five thousand years ago?""
Mr. Ibis said nothing, but he smirked loudly. Then he said, ""Three thousand five hundred and thirty years ago. Give or take.""
""Okay,"" said Shadow. ""I'll buy it, I guess. What were they trading?""
""Not much,"" said Mr. Ibis. ""Animal skins. Some food. Copper from the mines in the upper peninsula. The whole thing was rather a disappointment. Not worth the effort. They stayed here long enough to believe in us, to sacrifice to us, and for a handful of the traders to die of fever and be buried here, leaving us behind them."" He stopped dead in the middle of the sidewalk, turned around slowly, arms extended. ""This country has been Grand Central Station for ten thousand years or more. You say to me, what about Columbus?""
""Sure,"" said Shadow, obligingly. ""What about him?""
""Columbus did what people had been doing for thousands of years. There's nothing special about coming to America. I've been writing stories about it, from time to time."" They began to walk again.
""True stories?""
""Up to a point, yes. I'll let you read one or two, if you like. It's all there for anyone who has eyes to see it. Personally-and this is speaking as a subscriber to Scientific American, here-I feel very sorry for the professionals whenever they find another confusing skull, something that belonged to the wrong sort of people, or whenever they find statues or artifacts that confuse them-for they'll talk about the odd, but they won't talk about the impossible, which is where I feel sorry for them, for as soon as something becomes impossible it slipslides out of belief entirely, whether it's true or not. I mean, here's a skull that shows the Ainu, the Japanese aboriginal race, were in America nine thousand years ago. Here's another that shows there were Polynesians in California nearly two thousand years later. And all the scientists mutter and puzzle over who's descended from whom, missing the point entirely. Heaven knows what'll happen if they ever actually find the Hopi emergence tunnels. That'll shake a few things up, you just wait.
""Did the Irish come to America in the dark ages, you ask me? Of course they did, and the Welsh, and the Vikings, while the Africans from the west coast-what in later days they called the slave coast or the ivory coast-they were trading with South America, and the Chinese visited Oregon a couple of times: they called it Fu Sang. The Basque established their secret sacred fishing grounds off the coast of Newfoundland twelve hundred years back. Now, I suppose you're going to say, but, Mister Ibis, these people were primitives, they didn't have radio controls and vitamin pills and jet airplanes.""
Shadow hadn't said anything, and hadn't planned to say anything, but he felt it was required of him, so he said, ""Well, weren't they?"" The last dead leaves of the autumn crackled underfoot, winter-crisp.
""The misconception is that men didn't travel long distances in boats before the days of Columbus. Yet New Zealand and Tahiti and countless Pacific islands were settled by people in boats whose navigation skills would have put Columbus to shame; and the wealth of Africa was from trading, although that was mostly to the East, to India and China. My people, the Nile folk, we discovered early on that a reed boat will take you around the world, if you have the patience and enough jars of sweet water. You see, the biggest problem with coming to America in the old days was that there wasn't a lot here that anyone wanted to trade, and it was much too far away.""
They had reached a large house, built in the style people called Queen Anne. Shadow wondered who Queen Anne was, and why she had been so fond of Addams Family-style houses. It was the only building on the block that wasn't locked up with boarded-over windows. They went through the gate and walked around the back of the building.
Through large double doors, which Mr. Ibis unlocked with a key from his keychain, and they were in a large, unheated room, occupied by two people: a very tall, dark-skinned man, holding a large metal scalpel, and a dead girl in her late teens, lying on a long, porcelain object that resembled both a table and a sink.
There were several photographs of the dead girl pinned up on a cork-board on the wall above the body. She was smiling in one, a high school head shot. In another she was standing in a line with three other girls; they were wearing what might have been prom dresses, and her black hair was tied above her head in an intricate knot-work.
Cold on the porcelain, her hair was down, loose around her shoulders, and matted with dried blood.
""This is my partner, Mister Jacquel,"" said Ibis.
""We met already,"" said Jacquel. ""Forgive me if I don't shake hands.""
Shadow looked down at the girl on the table. ""What happened to her?"" he asked.
""Poor taste in boyfriends,"" said Jacquel.
""It's not always fatal,"" said Mr. Ibis, with a sigh. ""This time it was. He was drunk, and he had a knife, and she told him that she thought she was pregnant. He didn't believe it was his.""
""She was stabbed...,"" said Mr. Jacquel, and he counted. There was a click as he stepped on a footswitch, turning on a small Dictaphone on a nearby table. ""Five times. There are three knife wounds in the left anterior chest wall. The first is between the fourth and fifth intercostal spaces at the medial border of the left breast, two point two centimeters in length; the second and third are through the inferior portion of the left mid-breast penetrating at the sixth interspace, overlapping, and measuring three centimeters. There is one wound two centimeters long in the upper anterior left chest in the second interspace, and one wound five centimeters long and a maximum of one point six centimeters deep in the anteromedial left deltoid, a slashing injury. All the chest wounds are deep penetrating injuries. There are no other visible wounds externally."" He released pressure from the foot switch. Shadow noticed a small microphone dangling above the embalming table by its cord.
""So you're the coroner as well?"" asked Shadow.
""Coroner's a political appointment around here,"" said Ibis. ""His job is to kick the corpse. If it doesn't kick him back, he signs the death certificate. Jacquel's what they call a prosector. He works for the county medical examiner. He does autopsies, and saves tissue samples for analysis. He's already photographed her wounds.""
Jacquel ignored them. He took a big scalpel and made a deep incision in a large V which began at both collarbones and met at the bottom of her breastbone, and then he turned the V into a Y, another deep incision that continued from her breastbone to her pubis. He picked up what looked like a small, heavy chrome drill with a medallion-sized round saw blade at the business end. He turned it on, and cut through the ribs at both sides of her breastbone.
The girl opened like a purse.
Shadow suddenly was aware of a mild but unpleasantly penetrating, pungent, meaty smell.
""I thought it would smell worse,"" said Shadow.
""She's pretty fresh,"" said Jacquel. ""And the intestines weren't pierced, so it doesn't smell of shit.""
Shadow found himself looking away, not from revulsion, as he would have expected, but from a strange desire to give the girl some privacy. It would be hard to be nakeder than this open thing.
Jacquel tied off the intestines, glistening and snakelike in her belly, below the stomach and deep in the pelvis. He ran them through his fingers, foot after foot of them, described them as ""normal"" to the microphone, put them in a bucket on the floor. He sucked all the blood out of her chest with a vacuum pump, and measured the volume. Then he inspected the inside of her chest. He said to the microphone, ""There are three lacerations in the pericardium, which is filled with clotted and liquefied blood.""
Jacquel grasped her heart, cut it at its top, turned it about in his hand, examining it. He stepped on his switch and said, ""There are two l acerations of the myocardium; a one-point-five-centimeter laceration in the right ventricle and a one-point-eight-centimeter laceration penetrating the left ventricle.""
Jacquel removed each lung. The left lung had been stabbed and was half collapsed. He weighed them, and the heart, and he photographed the wounds. From each lung he sliced a small piece of tissue, which he placed into a jar.
""Formaldehyde,"" whispered Mr. Ibis, helpfully.
Jacquel continued to talk to the microphone, describing what he was doing, what he saw, as he removed the girl's liver, the stomach, spleen, pancreas, both kidneys, the uterus and the ovaries.
He weighed each organ, reported them as normal and uninjured. From each organ he took a small slice and put it into a jar of formaldehyde.
From the heart, the liver, and from one of the kidneys, he cut an additional slice. These pieces he chewed, slowly, making them last, and ate while he worked.
Somehow it seemed to Shadow a good thing for him to do: respectful, not obscene.
""So you want to stay here with us for a spell?"" said Jacquel, masticating the slice of the girl's heart.
""If you'll have me,"" said Shadow.
""Certainly we'll have you,"" said Mr. Ibis. ""No reasons why not and plenty of reasons why. You'll be under our protection as long as you're here.""
""I hope you don't mind sleeping under the same roof as the dead,"" said Jacquel.
Shadow thought of the touch of Laura's lips, bitter and cold. ""No,"" he said. ""Not as long as they stay dead, anyhow.""
Jacquel turned and looked at him with dark brown eyes as quizzical and cold as a desert dog's. ""They stay dead here,"" was all he said.
""Seems to me,"" said Shadow. ""Seems to me that the dead come back pretty easy.""
""Not at all,"" said Ibis. ""Even zombies, they make them out of the living, you know. A little powder, a little chanting, a little push, and you have a zombie. They live, but they believe they are dead. But to truly bring the dead back to life, in their bodies. That takes power."" He hesitates, then, ""In the old land, in the old days, it was easier then.""
""You could bind the ka of a man to his body for five thousand years,"" said Jacquel. ""Binding or loosing. But that was a long time ago."" He took all the organs that he had removed and replaced them, respectfully, in the body cavity. He replaced the intestines and the breastbone and pulled the skin edges near each other. Then he took a thick needle and thread and, with deft, quick strokes, he sewed it up, like a man stitching a baseball: the cadaver transformed from meat into girl once again.
""I need a beer,"" said Jacquel. He pulled off his rubber gloves and dropped them into the bin. He dropped his dark brown overalls into a hamper. Then he took the cardboard tray of jars filled with little red and brown and purple slices of the organs. ""Coming?""
They walked up the back stairs to the kitchen. It was brown and white, a sober and respectable room that looked to Shadow as if it had last been decorated in 1920. There was a huge Kelvinator rattling to itself by one wall. Jacquel opened the Kelvinator's door, put the plastic jars with their slivers of spleen, of kidney, of liver, of heart, inside. He took out three brown bottles. Ibis opened a glass-fronted cupboard, removed three tall glasses. Then he gestured for Shadow to sit down at the kitchen table.
Ibis poured the beer and passed a glass to Shadow, a glass to Jacquel. It was a fine beer, bitter and dark.
""Good beer,"" said Shadow.
""We brew it ourselves,"" said Ibis. ""In the old days the women did the brewing. They were better brewers than we are. But now it is only the three of us here. Me, him, and her."" He gestured toward the small brown cat, fast asleep in a cat-basket in the corner of the room. ""There were more of us, in the beginning. But Set left us to explore, what, two hundred years ago? Must be, by now. We got a postcard from him from San Francisco in 1905, 1906. Then nothing. While poor Horus..."" He trailed off, in a sigh, and shook his head.
""I still see him, on occasion,"" said Jacquel. ""On my way to a pickup."" He sipped his beer.
""I'll work for my keep,"" said Shadow. ""While I'm here. You tell me what you need doing, and I'll do it.""
""We'll find work for you,"" agreed Jacquel.
The small brown cat opened her eyes and stretched to her feet. She padded across the kitchen floor and pushed at Shadow's boot with her head. He put down his left hand and scratched her forehead and the back of her ears and the scruff of her neck. She arched ecstatically, then sprang into his lap, pushed herself up against his chest, and touched her cold nose to his. Then she curled up in his lap and went back to sleep. He put his hand down to stroke her: her fur was soft, and she was warm and pleasant in his lap: she acted like she was in the safest place in the world, and Shadow felt comforted.
The beer left a pleasant buzz in Shadow's head.
""Your room is at the top of the stairs, by the bathroom,"" said Jacquel. ""Your work clothes will be hanging in the closet-you'll see. You'll want to wash up and shave first, I guess.""
Shadow did. He showered standing in the cast-iron tub and he shaved, very nervously, with a straight razor that Jacquel loaned him. It was obscenely sharp, and had a mother-of-pearl handle, and Shadow suspected it was usually used to give dead men their final shave. He had never used a straight razor before, but he did not cut himself. He washed off the shaving cream, looked at himself naked in the fly-specked bathroom mirror. He was bruised: fresh bruises on his chest and arms overlaying the fading bruises that Mad Sweeney had left him. He looked at his wet, black hair and the dark gray eyes which looked back mistrustfully from the mirror at him, looked at the marks on his coffee-colored skin.
And then, as if someone else were holding his hand, he raised the straight razor, placed it, blade open, against his throat.
It would be a way out, he thought. An easy way out. And if there's anyone who'd simply take it in their stride, who'd just clean up the mess and get on with things, it's the two guys sitting downstairs at the kitchen table drinking their beer. No more worries. No more Laura. No more mysteries and conspiracies. No more bad dreams. Just peace and quiet and rest forever. One clean slash, ear to ear. That's all it'll take.
He stood there with the razor against his throat. A tiny smudge of blood came from the place where the blade touched the skin. He had not even noticed a cut. See, he told himself, and he could almost hear the words being whispered in his ear. It's painless. Too sharp to hurt. I'll be gone before I know it.
Then the door to the bathroom swung open, just a few inches, enough for the little brown cat to put her head around the doorframe and ""Mrr?"" up at him, curiously.
""Hey,"" he said to the cat. ""I thought I locked that door.""
He closed the cut-throat razor, put it down on the side of the sink, dabbed at his tiny cut with a toilet paper swab. Then he wrapped a towel around his waist and went into the bedroom next door.
His bedroom, like the kitchen, seemed to have been decorated some time in the 1920s: there was a washstand and a pitcher beside the chest of drawers and mirror. The room itself smelled faintly musty, as if it was too infrequently aired, and the sheets of the bed seemed faintly damp when he touched them.
Someone had already laid out clothes for him on the bed: a black suit, white shirt, black tie, white undershirt and underpants, black socks. Black shoes sat on the worn Persian carpet beside the bed.
He dressed himself. The clothes were of good quality, although none of them were new. He wondered who they had belonged to. Was he wearing a dead man's socks? Would he be stepping into a dead man's shoes? Then he put the clothes on and looked at himself in the mirror. The clothes fit perfectly: there was not even the stretching around the chest or the shortness in the arms he had expected. He adjusted the tie in the mirror and now it seemed to him that his reflection was smiling at him, sardonically. He scratched the side of his nose, was actually relieved when his reflection did the same.
Now it seemed inconceivable to him that he had ever thought of cutting his throat. His reflection continued to smile as he adjusted his tie.
""Hey,"" he said to it, ""you know something that I don't?"" and immediately felt foolish.
The door creaked open and the cat slipped between the doorpost and the door and padded across the room, then up on the windowsill. ""Hey,"" he said to the cat. ""I did shut that door. I know I shut that door."" She looked at him, interested. Her eyes were dark yellow, the color of amber. Then she jumped down from the sill, onto the bed, where she wrapped herself into a curl of fur and went back to sleep, a circle of cat upon the old counterpane.
Shadow left the bedroom door open, so the cat could leave and the room air a little, and he walked downstairs. The stairs creaked and grumbled as he walked down them, protesting his weight, as if they just wanted to be left in peace.
""Damn you look good,"" said Jacquel. He was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, and was now himself dressed in a black suit, similar to Shadow's. ""You ever driven a hearse?""
""No.""
""First time for everything, then,"" said Jacquel. ""It's parked out front.""
  
An old woman had died. Her name had been Lila Goodchild. At Mr. Jacquel's direction, Shadow carried the folded aluminum gurney up the narrow stairs to her bedroom and unfolded it next to her bed. He took out a translucent blue plastic body bag, laid it next to the dead woman on the bed, and unzipped it open. She wore a pink nightgown and a quilted robe. Shadow lifted her and wrapped her, fragile and almost weightless, in a blanket, and placed it onto the bag. He zipped the bag shut and put it on the gurney. While Shadow did this, Jacquel talked to a very old man who had, when she was alive, been married to Lila Goodchild. Or rather, Jacquel listened while the old man talked. As Shadow had zipped Mrs. Goodchild away the old man had been explaining how ungrateful his children had been, and grandchildren too, though that wasn't their fault, that was their parents', the apple didn't fall far from the tree, and he thought he'd raised them better than that.
Shadow and Jacquel wheeled the loaded gurney to the narrow flight of stairs. The old man followed them, still talking, mostly about money, and greed, and ingratitude. He wore bedroom slippers. Shadow carried the heavier bottom end of the gurney down the stairs and out onto the street, then he wheeled it along the icy sidewalk to the hearse. Jacquel opened the hearse's rear door. Shadow hesitated, and Jacquel said, ""Just push it on in there. The supports'll fold up out of the way."" Shadow pushed the gurney, and the supports snapped up, the wheels rotated, and the gurney rolled right on to the floor of the hearse. Jacquel showed him how to strap it in securely, and Shadow closed up the hearse while Jacquel listened to the old man who had been married to Lila Goodchild, unmindful of the cold, an old man in his slippers and his bathrobe out on the wintry sidewalk telling Jacquel how his children were vultures, no better than hovering vultures, waiting to take what little he and Lila had scraped together, and how the two of them had fled to St. Louis, to Memphis, to Miami, and how they wound up in Cairo, and how relieved he was that Lila had not died in a nursing home, how scared he was that he would.
They walked the old man back into the house, up the stairs to his room. A small TV set droned from one corner of the couple's bedroom. As Shadow passed it he noticed that the newsreader was grinning and winking at him. When he was sure that no one was looking in his direction he gave the set the finger.
""They've got no money,"" said Jacquel when they were back in the hearse. ""He'll come in to see Ibis tomorrow. He'll choose the cheapest funeral. Her friends will persuade him to do her right, give her a proper sendoff in the front room, I expect. But he'll grumble. Got no money. Nobody around here's got money these days. Anyway, he'll be dead in six months. A year at the outside.""
Snowflakes tumbled and drifted in front of the headlights. The snow was coming south. Shadow said, ""Is he sick?""
""It ain't that. Women survive their men. Men-men like him-don't live long when their women are gone. You'll see-he'll just start wandering, all the familiar things are going to be gone with her. He gets tired and he fades and then he gives up and then he's gone. Maybe pneumonia will take him or maybe it'll be cancer, or maybe his heart will stop. Old age, and all the fight gone out of you. Then you die.""
Shadow thought. ""Hey, Jacquel?""
""Yeah.""
""Do you believe in the soul?"" It wasn't quite the question he had been going to ask, and it took him by surprise to hear it coming from his mouth. He had intended to say something less direct, but there was nothing less direct that he could say.
""Depends. Back in my day, we had it all set up. You line up when you die, and you answer for your evil deeds and for your good deeds, and if your evil deeds outweighed a feather, we'd feed your soul and your heart to Ammet, the Eater of Souls.""
""He must have eaten a lot of people.""
""Not as many as you'd think. It was a really heavy feather. We had it made special. You had to be pretty damn evil to tip the scales on that baby. Stop here, that gas station. We'll put in a few gallons.""
The streets were quiet, in the way that streets only are when the first snow falls. ""It's going to be a white Christmas,"" said Shadow as he pumped the gas.
""Yup. Shit. That boy was one lucky son of a virgin.""
""Jesus?""
""Lucky, lucky guy. He could fall in a cesspit and come up smelling like roses. Hell, it's not even his birthday, you know that? He took it from Mithras. You run into Mithras yet? Red cap. Nice kid.""
""No, I don't think so.""
""Well...I've never seen Mithras around here. He was an army brat. Maybe he's back in the Middle East, taking it easy, but I expect he's probably gone by now. It happens. One day every soldier in the empire has to shower in the blood of your sacrificial bull. The next they don't even remember your birthday.""
Swish went the windshield wipers, pushing the snow to the side, bunching the flakes up into knots and swirls of clear ice.
A traffic light turned momentarily yellow and then red, and Shadow put his foot on the brake. The hearse fishtailed and swung around on the empty road before it stopped.
The light turned green. Shadow took the hearse up to ten miles per hour, which seemed enough on the slippery roads. It was perfectly happy cruising in second gear: he guessed it must have spent a lot of its time at that speed, holding up traffic.
""That's good,"" said Jacquel. ""So, yeah, Jesus does pretty good over here. But I met a guy who said he saw him hitchhiking by the side of the road in Afghanistan and nobody was stopping to give him a ride. You know? It all depends on where you are.""
""I think a real storm's coming,"" said Shadow. He was talking about the weather.
Jacquel, when, eventually, he began to answer, wasn't talking about the weather at all. ""You look at me and Ibis,"" he said. ""We'll be out of business in a few years. We got savings put aside for the lean years, but the lean years have been here for a long while, and every year they just get leaner. Horus is crazy, really bugfuck crazy, spends all his time as a hawk, eats roadkill, what kind of a life is that? You've seen Bast. And we're in better shape than most of them. At least we've got a little belief to be going along with. Most of the suckers out there have barely got that. It's like the funeral business-the big guys are going to buy you up one day, like it or not, because they're bigger and more efficient and because they work. Fighting's not going to change a damned thing, because we lost this particular battle when we came to this green land a hundred years ago or a thousand or ten thousand. We arrived and America just didn't care that we'd arrived. So we get bought out, or we press on, or we hit the road. So, yes. You're right. The storm's coming.""
Shadow turned onto the street where the houses were, all but one of them, dead, their windows blind and boarded. ""Take the back alley,"" said Jacquel.
He backed the hearse up until it was almost touching the double doors at the rear of the house. Ibis opened the hearse, and the mortuary doors, and Shadow unbuckled the gurney and pulled it out. The wheeled supports rotated and dropped as they cleared the bumper. He wheeled the gurney to the embalming table. He picked up Lila Goodchild, cradling her in her opaque bag like a sleeping child, and placed her carefully on the table in the chilly mortuary, as if he were afraid to wake her.
""You know, I have a transfer board,"" said Jacquel. ""You don't have to carry her.""
""Ain't nothing,"" said Shadow. He was starting to sound more like Jacquel. ""I'm a big guy. It doesn't bother me.""
As a kid Shadow had been small for his age, all elbows and knees. The only photograph of Shadow as a kid that Laura had liked enough to frame showed a serious child with unruly hair and dark eyes standing beside a table, laden high with cakes and cookies. Shadow thought the picture might have been taken at an embassy Christmas party, as he had been dressed in a bowtie and his best clothes, as one might dress a doll. He was looking solemnly out at the adult world that surrounded him.
They had moved too much, his mother and Shadow, first around Europe, from embassy to embassy, where his mother had worked as a communicator in the Foreign Service, transcribing and sending classified telegrams across the world, and then, when he was eight years old, back to the U.S., where his mother, now too sporadically sick to hold down a steady job, had moved from city to city restlessly spending a year here or a year there, temping when she was well enough. They never spent long enough in any place for Shadow to make friends, to feel at home, to relax. And Shadow had been a small child...
He had grown so fast. In the spring of his thirteenth year the local kids had been picking on him, goading him into fights they knew they could not fail to win and after which Shadow would run, angry and often weeping, to the boys' room to wash the mud or the blood from his face before anyone could see it. Then came summer, a long, magical, thirteenth summer, which he spent keeping out of the way of the bigger kids, swimming in the local pool, reading library books at poolside. At the start of the summer he could barely swim. By the end of August he was swimming length after length in an easy crawl, diving from the high board, ripening to a deep brown from the sun and the water. In September, he had returned to school to discover that the boys who had made him miserable were small, soft things no longer capable of upsetting him. The two who tried it were taught better manners, hard and fast and painfully, and Shadow found that he had redefined himself: he could no longer be a quiet kid, doing his best to remain unobtrusively at the back of things. He was too big for that, too obvious. By the end of the year he was on the swimming team and on the weight-lifting team, and the coach was courting him for the triathlon team. He liked being big and strong. It gave him an identity. He'd been a shy, quiet, bookish kid, and that had been painful; now he was a big dumb guy, and nobody expected him to be able to do anything more than move a sofa into the next room on his own.
Nobody until Laura, anyway.
  
Mr. Ibis had prepared dinner: rice and boiled greens for himself and Mr. Jacquel. ""I am not a meat eater,"" he explained, ""while Jacquel gets all the meat he needs in the course of his work."" Beside Shadow's place was a carton of chicken pieces from KFC, and a bottle of beer.
There was more chicken than Shadow could eat, and he shared the leftovers with the cat, removing the skin and crusty coating then shredding the meat for her with his fingers.
""There was a guy in prison named Jackson,"" said Shadow, as he ate, ""worked in the prison library. He told me that they changed the name from Kentucky Fried Chicken to KFC because they don't serve real chicken any more. It's become this genetically modified mutant thing, like a giant centipede with no head, just segment after segment of legs and breasts and wings. It's fed through nutrient tubes. This guy said the government wouldn't let them use the word chicken.""
Mr. Ibis raised his eyebrows. ""You think that's true?""
""Nope. Now, my old cellmate, Low Key, he said they changed the name because the word fried had become a bad word. Maybe they wanted people to think that the chicken cooked itself.""
After dinner Jacquel excused himself and went down to the mortuary. Ibis went to his study to write. Shadow sat in the kitchen for a little longer, feeding fragments of chicken breast to the little brown cat, sipping his beer. When the beer and the chicken were gone, he washed up the plates and cutlery, put them on the rack to dry, and went upstairs.
He took a bath in the claw-footed bathtub, brushed his teeth with his disposable toothbrush and toothpaste. Tomorrow, he decided, he would buy a new toothbrush.
When he returned to the bedroom the little brown cat was once more asleep at the bottom of the bed, curled into a fur crescent. In the middle drawer of the vanity he found several pairs of striped cotton pajamas. They looked seventy years old, but smelled fresh, and he pulled on a pair which, like the black suit, fitted him as if they had been tailored for him.
There was a small stack of Reader's Digests on the little table beside the bed, none of them dated later than March 1960. Jackson, the library guy-the same one who had sworn to the truth of the Kentucky Fried Mutant Chicken Creature story, who had told him the story of the black freight trains that the government uses to haul political prisoners off to Secret Northern Californian Concentration Camps, moving across the country in the dead of the night-Jackson had also told him that the CIA used the Reader's Digest as a front for their branch offices around the world. He said that every Reader's Digest office in every country was really CIA.
""A joke,"" said the late Mr. Wood, in Shadow's memory. ""How can we be sure the CIA wasn't involved in the Kennedy assassination?"" Shadow cracked the window open a few inches-enough for fresh air to get in, enough for the cat to be able to get out onto the balcony outside.
He turned on the bedside lamp, climbed into bed and read for a little, trying to turn off his mind, to get the last few days out of his head, picking the dullest-looking articles in the dullest-looking Digests. He noticed he was falling asleep halfway through ""I Am John's Pancreas."" He barely had time enough to turn out the bedside light and put his head down on the pillow before his eyes closed for the night.
  
Later he was never able to recollect the sequences and details of that dream: attempts to remember it produced nothing more than a tangle of dark images, underexposed in the darkroom of his mind. There was a girl. He had met her somewhere, and now they were walking across a bridge. It spanned a small lake, in the middle of a town. The wind was ruffling the surface of the lake, making waves tipped with whitecaps, which seemed to Shadow to be tiny hands reaching for him.
-Down there, said the woman. She was wearing a leopard-print skirt which flapped and tossed in the wind, and the flesh between the top of her stockings and her skirt was creamy and soft and in his dream, on the bridge, before God and the world, Shadow went down to his knees in front of her, burying his head in her crotch, drinking in the intoxicating jungle female scent of her. He became aware, in his dream, of his erection in real life, a rigid, pounding, monstrous thing as painful in its hardness as the erections he'd had as a boy, when he was crashing into puberty with no idea of what the unprompted rigidities were, knowing only that they scared him.
He pulled away and looked upward, and still he could not see her face. But his mouth was seeking hers and her lips were soft against his, and his hands were cupping her breasts, and then they were running across the satin smoothness of her skin, pushing into and parting the furs that hid her waist, sliding into the wonderful cleft of her which warmed and wetted and parted for him, opening to his hand like a flower.
The woman purred against him ecstatically, her hand moving down to the hardness of him and squeezing it. He pushed the bed sheets away and rolled on top of her, his hand parting her thighs, her hand guiding him between her legs, where one thrust, one magical push...
Now he was back in his old prison cell with her, and he was kissing her deeply. She wrapped her arms tightly around him, clamped her legs about his legs to hold him tight, so he could not pull out, not even if he wanted to.
Never had he kissed lips so soft. He had not known that there were lips so soft in the whole world. Her tongue, though, was sandpaper-rough as it slipped against his.
-Who are you? he asked.
She made no answer, just pushed him onto his back and, in one lithe movement, straddled him and began to ride him. No, not to ride him: to insinuate herself against him in series of silken-smooth waves, each more powerful than the one before, strokes and beats and rhythms which crashed against his mind and his body just as the wind-waves on the lake splashed against the shore. Her nails were needle-sharp and they pierced his sides, raking them, but he felt no pain, only pleasure, everything was transmuted by some alchemy into moments of utter pleasure.
He struggled to find himself, struggled to talk, his head now filled with sand dunes and desert winds.
-Who are you? he asked again, gasping for the words.
She stared at him with eyes the color of dark amber, then lowered her mouth to his and kissed him with a passion, kissed him so completely and so deeply that there, on the bridge over the lake, in his prison cell, in the bed in the Cairo funeral home, he almost came. He rode the sensation like a kite riding a hurricane, willing it not to crest, not to explode, wanting it never to end. He pulled it under control. He had to warn her.
-My wife, Laura. She will kill you.
-Not me, she said.
A fragment of nonsense bubbled up from somewhere in his mind: in medieval days it was said that a woman on top during coitus would conceive a bishop. That was what they called it: trying for a bishop...
He wanted to know her name, but he dared not ask her a third time, and she pushed her chest against his, and he could feel the hard nubs of her nipples against his chest, and she was squeezing him, somehow squeezing him down there deep inside her and this time he could not ride it or surf it, this time it picked him up and spun and tumbled him away, and he was arching up, pushing into her as deeply as he could imagine, as if they were, in some way, part of the same creature, tasting, drinking, holding, wanting...
-Let it happen, she said, her voice a throaty feline growl. Give it to me. Let it happen. And he came, spasming and dissolving, the back of his mind itself liquefying then sublimating slowly from one state to the next.
Somewhere in there, at the end of it, he took a breath, a clear draught of air he felt all the way down to the depths of his lungs, and he knew that he had been holding his breath for a long time now. Three years, at least. Perhaps even longer.
-Now rest, she said, and she kissed his eyelids with her soft lips. Let it go. Let it all go.
The sleep he slept after that was deep and dreamless and comforting, and Shadow dived deep and embraced it.
  
The light was strange. It was-he checked his watch-six forty-five A.M., and still dark outside, but the room was filled with a pale blue dimness. He climbed out of bed. He was certain that he had been wearing pajamas when he went to bed, but now he was naked, and the air was cold on his skin. He walked to the window and closed it.
There had been a snowstorm in the night: six inches had fallen, perhaps more. The corner of the town that Shadow could see from his window, dirty and run-down, had been transformed into somewhere clean and different: these houses were not abandoned and forgotten, they were frosted into elegance. The streets had vanished completely, lost beneath a white field of snow.
There was an idea that hovered at the edge of his perception. Something about transience. It flickered and was gone.
He could see as well as if it were full daylight.
In the mirror, Shadow noticed something strange. He stepped closer, and stared, puzzled. All his bruises had vanished. He touched his side, pressing firmly with his fingertips, feeling for one of the deep pains that told him he had encountered Mr. Stone and Mr. Wood, hunting for the greening blossoms of bruise that Mad Sweeney had gifted him with, and finding nothing. His face was clear and unmarked. His sides, however, and his back (he twisted to examine it) were scratched with what looked like claw marks.
He hadn't dreamed it, then. Not entirely.
Shadow opened the drawers, and put on what he found: an ancient pair of blue-denim Levis, a shirt, a thick blue sweater, and a black undertaker's coat he found hanging in the wardrobe at the back of the room. He wondered again who the clothes had belonged to.
He wore his own old shoes.
The house was still asleep. He crept through it, willing the floorboards not to creak, and then he was outside (out through the front door, not the mortuary, not this morning, not when he didn't have to), and he walked through the snow, his feet leaving deep prints in the virgin snow, his steps crunching as they pushed the soft snow deep onto the sidewalk. It was lighter out than it had seemed from inside the house, and the snow reflected the light from the sky.
After fifteen minutes walking, Shadow came to a bridge, with a big sign on the side of it warning him he was now leaving historical Cairo. A man stood under the bridge, tall and gangling, sucking on a cigarette and shivering continually. Shadow thought he recognized the man, but the light on the snow was playing tricks on his eyes, and he walked closer and closer in order to be sure. The man wore a patched denim jacket and a baseball cap.
And then, under the bridge in the winter darkness he was close enough to see the purple smudge of bruise around the man's eye, and he said, ""Good morning, Mad Sweeney.""
The world was so quiet. Not even cars disturbed the snowbound silence.
""Hey, man,"" said Mad Sweeney. He did not look up. The cigarette had been rolled by hand. Shadow wondered if the man was smoking a joint. No, the smell was tobacco.
""You keep hanging out under bridges, Mad Sweeney,"" said Shadow, ""people gonna think you're a troll.""
This time Mad Sweeney looked up. Shadow could see the whites of his eyes all around his irises. The man looked scared. ""I was lookin' for you,"" he said. ""You gotta help me, man. I fucked up big-time."" He sucked on his hand-rolled cigarette, pulled it away from his mouth. The cigarette paper stuck to his lower lip, and the cigarette fell apart, spilling its contents onto his ginger beard and down the front of his filthy T-shirt. Mad Sweeney brushed it off, convulsively, with blackened hands, as if it were a dangerous insect.
""My resources are pretty much tapped out, Mad Sweeney,"" said Shadow. ""But why don't you tell me what it is you need. You want me to get you a coffee?""
Mad Sweeney shook his head. He took out a tobacco pouch and papers from the pocket of his denim jacket and began to roll himself another cigarette. His beard bristled and his mouth moved as he did this, although no words were said aloud. He licked the adhesive side of the cigarette paper and rolled it between his fingers. The result looked only distantly like a cigarette. Then he said, ""'M not a troll. Shit. Those bastards're fucken mean.""
""I know you're not a troll, Sweeney,"" said Shadow, gently, hoping that he did not sound as if he were patronizing the man. ""How can I help you?""
Mad Sweeney flicked his Zippo, and the first inch of his cigarette flamed and then subsided to ash. ""You remember I showed you how to get a coin? You remember?""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. He saw the gold coin in his mind's eye, watched it tumble into Laura's casket, saw it glitter around her neck. ""I remember.""
""You took the wrong coin, man.""
A car approached the gloom beneath the bridge, blinding them with its lights. It slowed as it passed them, then stopped, and a window slid down. ""Everything okay here, gentlemen?""
""Everything's just peachy thank you, officer,"" said Shadow. ""Just out for a morning walk.""
""Okay now,"" said the cop. He did not look as if he believed that everything was okay. He waited. Shadow put a hand on Mad Sweeney's shoulder, and walked him forward, out of town, away from the police car. He heard the window hum closed, but the car remained where it was.
Shadow walked. Mad Sweeney walked, and sometimes he staggered. They passed a sign saying FUTURE CITY. Shadow imagined a city of spires and Frank R. Paul towers, all gleaming in gentle primary colors, bubble-domed air-cars flitting from tower to tower like glittering hoverflies. That was Future City and somehow Shadow didn't think it was ever going to be built in Cairo.
The police car cruised past them slowly, then turned, and went back into the city, accelerating down the snowy road.
""Now, why don't you tell me what's troubling you,"" said Shadow.
""I did it like he said. I did it all like he said, but I gave you the wrong coin. It wasn't meant to be that coin. That's for royalty. You see? I shouldn't even have been able to take it. That's the coin you'd give to the King of America himself. Not some pissant bastard like you or me. And now I'm in big trouble. Just give me the coin back, man. You'll never see me again, if you do, I sweartofuckenBran, okay? I swear by the years I spent in the fucken trees.""
""You did it like who said, Sweeney?""
""Grimnir. The dude you call Wednesday. You know who he is? Who he really is?""
""Yeah. I guess.""
There was a panicked look in the Irishman's crazy blue eyes. ""It was nothing bad. Nothing you can-nothing bad. He just told me to be there at that bar and to pick a fight with you. He said he wanted to see what you were made of.""
""He tell you to do anything else?""
Sweeney shivered and twitched; Shadow thought it was the cold for a moment, then knew where he'd seen that shuddering shiver before. In prison: it was a junkie shiver. Sweeney was in withdrawal from something, and Shadow would have been willing to bet it was heroin. A junkie leprechaun? Mad Sweeney pinched off the burning head of his cigarette, dropped it on the ground, put the unfinished yellowing rest of it into his pocket. He rubbed his filthy fingers together, breathed on them to try and rub warmth into them. His voice was a whine now. ""Listen, just give me the fucken coin, man. What do you want it for? Huh? Hey, you know there's more where that came from. I'll give you another, just as good. Hell, I'll give you a shitload, man.""
He took off his filthy baseball cap-then, with his right hand, he stroked the air, producing a large golden coin. He dropped it into his cap. And then he took another from a wisp of breath steam, and another, catching and grabbing them from the still morning air until the baseball cap was brimming with them and Sweeney was forced to hold it with both hands.
He extended the baseball cap filled with gold to Shadow. ""Here,"" he said. ""Take them, man. Just give me back the coin I gave to you."" Shadow looked down at the cap, wondered how much its contents would be worth.
""Where am I going to spend those coins, Mad Sweeney?"" Shadow asked. ""Are there a lot of places you can turn your gold into cash?""
He thought the Irishman was going to hit him for a moment, but the moment passed and Mad Sweeney just stood there, holding out his gold-filled cap with both hands like Oliver Twist. And then tears swelled in his blue eyes and began to spill down his cheeks. He took the cap and put it-now empty of everything except a greasy sweatband-back over his thinning scalp. ""You gotta, man,"" he was saying. ""Didn't I show you how to do it? I showed you how to take coins from the hoard. I showed you where the hoard was. The treasure of the sun. Just give me that first coin back. It didn't belong to me.""
""I don't have it any more.""
Mad Sweeney's tears stopped, and spots of color appeared in his cheeks. ""You, you fucken-"" he said, and then the words failed him and his mouth opened and closed, soundlessly.
""I'm telling you the truth,"" said Shadow. ""I'm sorry. If I had it, I'd give it back to you. But I gave it away.""
Sweeney's filthy hands clamped on Shadow's shoulders, and the pale blue eyes stared into his. The tears had made streaks in the dirt on Mad Sweeney's face. ""Shit,"" he said. Shadow could smell tobacco and stale beer and whiskey-sweat. ""You're telling the truth, you fucker. Gave it away and freely and of your own will. Damn your dark eyes, you gave it a-fucken-way.""
""I'm sorry."" Shadow remembered the whispering thump the coin had made as it landed in Laura's casket.
""Sorry or not, I'm damned and I'm doomed."" The tears were flowing once more, and clear snot began to run from the man's nose. His words dissolved, then, into syllables which never quite congealed together into words. ""Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah,"" he said. ""Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh."" He wiped his nose and his eyes on his sleeves, muddying his face into strange patterns, wiping the snot all over his beard and moustache.
Shadow squeezed Mad Sweeney's upper arm in an awkward male gesture. I'm here, it said.
""'Twere better I had never been conceived,"" said Mad Sweeney, at length. Then he looked up. ""The fellow you gave it to. Would he give it back?""
""It's a woman. And I don't know where she is. But no, I don't believe she would.""
Sweeney sighed, mournfully. ""When I was but a young pup,"" he said, ""there was a woman I met, under the stars, who let me play with her bubbies, and she told me my fortune. She told me that I would be undone and abandoned west of the sunrise, and that a dead woman's bauble would seal my fate. And I laughed and poured more barley wine and played with her bubbies some more, and I kissed her full on her pretty lips. Those were the good days-the first of the gray monks had not yet come to our land, nor had they ridden the green sea to westward. And now."" He stopped, mid-sentence. His head turned and he focused on Shadow. ""You shouldn't trust him,"" he said, reproachfully.
""Who?""
""Wednesday. You mustn't trust him.""
""I don't have to trust him. I work for him.""
""Do you remember how to do it?""
""What?"" Shadow felt he was having a conversation with half a dozen different people. The self-styled leprechaun sputtered and jumped from persona to persona, from theme to theme, as if the remaining clusters of brain cells were igniting, flaming, and then going out for good.
""The coins, man. The coins. I showed you, remember?"" He raised two fingers to his face, stared at them, then pulled a gold coin from his mouth. He tossed the coin to Shadow, who stretched out a hand to catch it, but no coin reached him.
""I was drunk,"" said Shadow. ""I don't remember.""
Sweeney stumbled across the road. It was light now and the world was white and gray. Shadow followed him. Sweeney walked in a long, loping stride, as if he were always falling, but his legs were there to stop him, to propel him into another stumble. When they reached the bridge, he held on to the bricks with one hand, and turned and said, ""You got a few bucks? I don't need much. Just enough for a ticket out of this place. Twenty bucks will do me fine. You got a twenty? Just a lousy twenty?""
""Where can you go on a twenty-dollar bus-ticket?"" asked Shadow.
""I can get out of here,"" said Sweeney. ""I can get away before the storm hits. Away from a world in which opiates have become the religion of the masses. Away from."" He stopped, wiped his nose on the side of his hand, then wiped his hand on his sleeve.
Shadow reached into his jeans, pulled out a twenty and passed it to Sweeney. ""Here.""
Sweeney crumpled it up and pushed it deep into the breast pocket of his oil-stained denim jacket, under the sew-on patch showing two vultures on a dead branch and, barely legible beneath them, the words PATIENCE MY ASS! I'M GOING TO KILL SOMETHING! He nodded. ""That'll get me where I need to go,"" he said.
He leaned against the brick, fumbled in his pockets until he found the unfinished stub of cigarette he had abandoned earlier. He lit it carefully, trying not to burn his fingers or his beard. ""I'll tell you something,"" he said, as if he had said nothing that day. ""You're walking on gallows ground, and there's a hempen rope around your neck and a raven-bird on each shoulder, waiting for your eyes, and the gallows tree has deep roots, for it stretches from heaven to hell, and our world is only the branch from which the rope is swinging."" He stopped. ""I'll rest here a spell,"" he said, crouching down, his back resting against the black brickwork.
""Good luck,"" said Shadow.
""Hell, I'm fucked,"" said Mad Sweeney. ""Whatever. Thanks.""
Shadow walked back toward the town. It was 8:00 A.M. and Cairo was waking like a tired beast. He glanced back to the bridge, and saw Sweeney's pale face, striped with tears and dirt, watching him go.
It was the last time Shadow saw Mad Sweeney alive.
  
The brief winter days leading up to Christmas were like moments of light between the winter darknesses, and they fled fast in the house of the dead.
It was the twenty-third of December, and Jacquel and Ibis's played host to a wake for Lila Goodchild. Bustling women filled the kitchen with tubs and with saucepans and with skillets and with Tupperware, and the deceased was laid out in her casket in the funeral home's front room with hothouse flowers around her. There was a table on the other side of the room laden high with coleslaw and beans and cornmeal hush puppies and chicken and ribs and black-eyed peas, and by mid-afternoon the house was filled with people weeping and laughing and shaking hands with the minister, everything being quietly organized and overseen by the sober-suited Messrs. Jacquel and Ibis. The burial would be on the following morning.
When the telephone in the hall rang (it was Bakelite and black and had an honest-to-goodness rotary dial on the front) Mr. Ibis answered. Then he took Shadow aside. ""That was the police,"" he said. ""Can you make a pickup?""
""Sure.""
""Be discreet. Here."" He wrote down an address on a slip of paper, then passed it to Shadow, who read the address, written in perfect copperplate handwriting, and then folded it up and put it in his pocket. ""There'll be a police car,"" Ibis added.
Shadow went out back and got the hearse. Mr. Jacquel and Mr. Ibis had each made a point, individually, of explaining that, really, the hearse should only be used for funerals, and they had a van that they used to collect bodies, but the van was being repaired, had been for three weeks now, and could he be very careful with the hearse? Shadow drove carefully down the street. The snowplows had cleaned the roads by now, but he was comfortable driving slowly. It seemed right to go slow in a hearse, although he could barely remember the last time he had seen a hearse on the streets. Death had vanished from the streets of America, thought Shadow; now it happened in hospital rooms and in ambulances. We must not startle the living, thought Shadow. Mr. Ibis had told him that they move the dead about in some hospitals on the lower level of apparently empty covered gurneys, the deceased traveling their own paths in their own covered ways.
A dark blue police cruiser was parked on a side street, and Shadow pulled up the hearse behind it. There were two cops inside the cruiser, drinking their coffee from thermos tops. They had the engine running to keep warm. Shadow tapped on the side window.
""Yeah?""
""I'm from the funeral home,"" said Shadow.
""We're waiting for the medical examiner,"" said the cop. Shadow wondered if it was the same man who had spoken to him under the bridge. The cop, who was black, got out of the car, leaving his colleague in the driver's seat, and walked Shadow back to a Dumpster. Mad Sweeney was sitting in the snow beside the Dumpster. There was an empty green bottle in his lap, a dusting of snow and ice on his face and baseball cap and shoulders. He didn't blink.
""Dead wino,"" said the cop.
""Looks like it,"" said Shadow.
""Don't touch anything yet,"" said the cop. ""Medical examiner should be here any time now. You ask me, the guy drank himself into a stupor and froze his ass.""
""Yes,"" agreed Shadow. ""That's certainly what it looks like.""
He squatted down and looked at the bottle in Mad Sweeney's lap. Jameson Irish whiskey: a twenty-dollar ticket out of this place. A small green Nissan pulled up, and a harassed middle-aged man with sandy hair and a sandy moustache got out, walked over. He touched the corpse's neck. He kicks the corpse, thought Shadow, and if it doesn't kick him back...
""He's dead,"" said the medical examiner. ""Any ID?""
""He's a John Doe,"" said the cop.
The medical examiner looked at Shadow. ""You working for Jacquel and Ibis?"" he asked.
""Yes,"" said Shadow.
""Tell Jacquel to get dentals and prints for ID and identity photos. We don't need a post. He should just draw blood for toxicology. Got that? Do you want me to write it down for you?""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""It's fine. I can remember.""
The man scowled fleetingly, then pulled a business card from his wallet, scribbled on it, and gave it to Shadow, saying, ""Give this to Jacquel."" Then the medical examiner said ""Merry Christmas"" to everyone, and was on his way. The cops kept the empty bottle.
Shadow signed for the John Doe and put it on the gurney. The body was pretty stiff, and Shadow couldn't get it out of a sitting position. He fiddled with the gurney, and found out that he could prop up one end. He strapped John Doe, sitting, to the gurney and put him in the back of the hearse, facing forward. Might as well give him a good ride. He closed the rear curtains. Then he drove back to the funeral home.
The hearse was stopped at a traffic light-the same lights he'd fishtailed at, several nights earlier-when Shadow heard a voice croak, ""And it's a fine wake I'll be wanting, with the best of everything, and beautiful women shedding tears and their clothes in their distress, and brave men lamenting and telling fine tales of me in my great days.""
""You're dead, Mad Sweeney,"" said Shadow. ""You take what you're given when you're dead.""
""Aye, that I shall,"" sighed the dead man sitting in the back of the hearse. The junkie whine had vanished from his voice now, replaced with a resigned flatness, as if the words were being broadcast from a long, long way away, dead words being sent out on a dead frequency.
The light turned green and Shadow put his foot gently down on the gas.
""But give me a wake tonight, nonetheless,"" said Mad Sweeney. ""Set me a place at table, and give me a stinking drunk wake tonight. You killed me, Shadow, you owe me that much.""
""I never killed you, Mad Sweeney,"" said Shadow. It's twenty dollars, he thought, for a ticket out of here. ""It was the drink and the cold killed you, not me.""
There was no reply, and there was silence in the car for the rest of the journey. After he parked at the back, Shadow wheeled the gurney out of the hearse and into the mortuary. He manhandled Mad Sweeney onto the embalming table as if he were hauling a side of beef.
He covered the John Doe with a sheet and left him there, with the paperwork beside him. As he went up the back stairs he thought he heard a voice, quiet and muted, like a radio playing in a distant room, which said, ""And what would drink or cold be doing killing me, a leprechaun of the blood? No, it was you losing the little golden sun killed me, Shadow, killed me dead as sure as water's wet and days are long and a friend will always disappoint you in the end.""
Shadow wanted to point out to Mad Sweeney that that was a kind of bitter philosophy, but he suspected it was the being dead that made you bitter.
He went upstairs to the main house, where a number of middle-aged women were putting Saran wrap on casserole dishes, popping the Tupperware tops onto plastic pots of cooling fried potatoes and macaroni and cheese.
Mr. Goodchild, the husband of the deceased, had Mr. Ibis against a wall, and was telling him how he knew none of his children would come out to pay their respects to their mother. The apple don't fall far from the tree, he told anyone who would listen to him. The apple don't fall far from the tree.
  
That evening Shadow laid an extra place at the table. He put a glass at each place, and a new bottle of Jameson Gold in the middle of the table. It was the most expensive Irish whiskey they sold at the liquor store. After they ate (a large platter of leftovers left for them by the middle-aged women) Shadow poured a generous tot into each glass-his, Ibis's, Jacquel's and Mad Sweeney's.
""So what if he's sitting on a gurney in the cellar,"" said Shadow, as he poured, ""on his way to a pauper's grave? Tonight we'll toast him, and give him the wake he wanted.""
Shadow raised his glass to the empty place at the table. ""I only met Mad Sweeney twice, alive,"" he said. ""The first time I thought he was a world-class jerk with the devil in him. The second time I thought he was a major fuckup and I gave him the money to kill himself. He showed me a coin trick I don't remember how to do, gave me some bruises, and claimed he was a leprechaun. Rest in peace, Mad Sweeney."" He sipped the whiskey, letting the smoky taste evaporate in his mouth. The other two drank, toasting the empty chair along with him.
Mr. Ibis reached into an inside pocket and pulled out a notebook, which he flipped through until he found the appropriate page, and he read out a summarized version of Mad Sweeney's life.
According to Mr. Ibis, Mad Sweeney had started his life as the guardian of a sacred rock in a small Irish glade, over three thousand years ago. Mr. Ibis told them of Mad Sweeney's love affairs, his enmities, the madness that gave him his power (""a later version of the tale is still told, although the sacred nature, and the antiquity, of much of the verse has long been forgotten""), the worship and adoration in his own land that slowly transmuted into a guarded respect and then, finally, into amusement; he told them the story of the girl from Bantry who came to the New World, and who brought her belief in Mad Sweeney the leprechaun with her, for hadn't she seen him of a night, down by the pool, and hadn't he smiled at her and called her by her own true name? She had become a refugee, in the hold of a ship of people who had watched their potatoes turn to black sludge in the ground, who had watched friends and lovers die of hunger, who dreamed of a land of full stomachs. The girl from Bantry Bay dreamed, specifically, of a city where a girl would be able to earn enough to bring her family over to the New World. Many of the Irish coming in to America thought of themselves as Catholics, even if they knew nothing of the catechism, even if all they knew of religion was the Bean Sidhe, the banshee, who came to wail at the walls of a house where death soon would be, and Saint Bride, who was once Bridget of the two sisters (each of the three was a Brigid, each was the same woman), and tales of Finn, of Oisín, of Conan the Bald-even of the leprechauns, the little people (and was that not the biggest joke of the Irish, for the leprechauns in their day were the tallest of the mound folk)...
All this and more Mr. Ibis told them in the kitchen that night. His shadow on the wall was stretched and bird-like, and as the whiskey flowed Shadow imagined it the head of a huge waterfowl, beak long and curved, and it was somewhere in the middle of the second glass that Mad Sweeney himself began to throw both details and irrelevancies into Ibis's narrative (""...such a girl she was, with breasts cream-colored and spackled with freckles, with the tips of them the rich reddish pink of the sunrise on a day when it'll be bucketing down before noon but glorious again by supper..."") and then Sweeney was trying, with both hands, to explain the history of the gods in Ireland, wave after wave of them as they came in from Gaul and from Spain and from every damn place, each wave of them transforming the last gods into trolls and fairies and every damn creature until Holy Mother Church herself arrived and every god in Ireland was transformed into a fairy or a saint or a dead king without so much as a by-your-leave...
Mr. Ibis polished his gold-rimmed spectacles and explained-enunciating even more clearly and precisely than usual, so Shadow knew he was drunk (his words and the sweat that beaded on his forehead in that chilly house were the only indications of this)-with forefinger wagging, explained that he was an artist and that his tales should not be seen as literal constructs but as imaginative re-creations, truer than the truth, and Mad Sweeney said, ""I'll show you an imaginative re-creation, my fist imaginatively re-creating your fucken face for starters,"" and Mr. Jacquel bared his teeth and growled at Sweeney, the growl of a huge dog who's not looking for a fight but can always finish one by ripping out your throat, and Sweeney took the message and sat down and poured himself another glass of whiskey.
""Have you remembered how I do my little coin trick?"" he asked Shadow with a grin.
""I have not.""
""If you can guess how I did it,"" said Mad Sweeney, his lips purple, his blue eyes beclouded, ""I'll tell you if you get warm.""
""It's not a palm is it?"" asked Shadow.
""It is not.""
""Is it a gadget of some kind? Something up your sleeve or elsewhere that shoots the coins up for you to catch? Or a coin on a wire that swings in front of and behind your hand?""
""It is not that neither. More whiskey, anybody?""
""I read in a book about a way of doing the Miser's Dream with latex covering the palm of your hand, making a skin-colored pouch for the coins to hide behind.""
""This is a sad wake for Great Sweeney who flew like a bird across all of Ireland and ate watercress in his madness: to be dead and unmourned save for a bird, a dog, and an idiot. No, it is not a pouch.""
""Well, that's pretty much it for ideas,"" said Shadow. ""I expect you just take them out of nowhere."" It was meant to be sarcasm, but then he saw the expression on Sweeney's face. ""You do,"" he said. ""You do take them from nowhere.""
""Well, not exactly nowhere,"" said Mad Sweeney. ""But now you're getting the idea. You take them from the hoard.""
""The hoard,"" said Shadow, starting to remember. ""Yes.""
""You just have to hold it in your mind, and it's yours to take from. The sun's treasure. It's there in those moments when the world makes a rainbow. It's there in the moment of eclipse and the moment of the storm.""
And he showed Shadow how to do the thing.
This time Shadow got it.
  
Shadow's head ached and pounded, and his tongue tasted and felt like flypaper. He squinted at the glare of the daylight. He had fallen asleep with his head on the kitchen table. He was fully dressed, although he had at some point taken off his black tie.
He walked downstairs, to the mortuary, and was relieved but unsurprised to see that John Doe was still on the embalming table. Shadow pried the empty bottle of Jameson Gold from the corpse's rigor-mortised fingers, and threw it away. He could hear someone moving about in the house above.
Mr. Wednesday was sitting at the kitchen table when Shadow went upstairs. He was eating leftover potato salad from a Tupperware container with a plastic spoon. He wore a dark gray suit, a white shirt and a deep gray tie: the morning sun glittered on the silver tiepin in the shape of a tree. He smiled at Shadow when he saw him.
""Ah, Shadow m'boy, good to see you're up. I thought you were going to sleep forever.""
""Mad Sweeney's dead,"" said Shadow.
""So I heard,"" said Wednesday. ""A great pity. Of course it will come to all of us, in the end."" He tugged on an imaginary rope, somewhere on the level of his ear, and then jerked his neck to one side, tongue protruding, eyes bulging. As quick pantomimes went, it was disturbing. And then he let go of the rope and smiled his familiar grin. ""Would you like some potato salad?""
""I would not."" Shadow darted a look around the kitchen and out into the hall. ""Do you know where Ibis and Jacquel are?""
""Indeed I do. They are burying Mrs. Lila Goodchild-something that they would probably have liked your help in doing, but I asked them not to wake you. You have a long drive ahead of you.""
""We're leaving?""
""Within the hour.""
""I should say goodbye.""
""Goodbyes are overrated. You'll see them again, I have no doubt, before this affair is done with.""
For the first time since that first night, Shadow observed, the small brown cat was curled up in her basket. She opened her incurious amber eyes and watched him go.
So Shadow left the house of the dead. Ice sheathed the winter-black bushes and trees as if they'd been insulated, made into dreams. The path was slippery.
Wednesday led the way to Shadow's white Chevy Nova, parked out on the road. It had been recently cleaned, and the Wisconsin plates had been removed, replaced with Minnesota plates. Wednesday's luggage was already stacked in the back seat. Wednesday unlocked the car with keys that were duplicates of the ones Shadow had in his own pocket.
""I'll drive,"" said Wednesday. ""It'll be at least an hour before you're good for anything.""
They drove north, the Mississippi on their left, a wide silver stream beneath a gray sky. Shadow saw, perched on a leafless gray tree beside the road, a huge brown and white hawk, which stared down at them with mad eyes as they drove toward it, then took to the wing and rose in slow and powerful circles and, in moments, was out of sight.
Shadow realized it had only been a temporary reprieve, his time in the house of the dead; and already it was beginning to feel like something that happened to somebody else, a long time ago.

My Ainsel 
AG_ch8	AG	American Gods	8	11315	61143	CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 

They tried to stand off the soldiers, but the men fired and killed them both. So the song's wrong about the jail, but that's put in for poetry. You can't allus have things like they are in poetry. Poetry ain't what you'd call truth. There ain't room enough in the verses.
-A SINGER'S COMMENTARY ON ""THE BALLAD OF SAM BASS,"" A TREASURY OF AMERICAN FOLKLORE 
None of this can actually be happening. If it makes you more comfortable, you could simply think of it as metaphor. Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you-even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers and triumphs over all opposition.
Religions are places to stand and look and act, vantage points from which to view the world.
So, none of this is happening. Such things could not occur in this day and age. Never a word of it is literally true, although it all happened, and the next thing that happened, happened like this:
At the foot of Lookout Mountain, which is scarcely more than a very high hill, men and women were gathered around a small bonfire in the rain. They stood beneath the trees, which provided poor cover, and they were arguing.
The lady Kali, with her ink-black skin and white, sharp teeth, said, ""It is time.""
Anansi, with lemon-yellow gloves and silvering hair, shook his head. ""We can wait,"" he said. ""While we can wait, we should wait.""
There was a murmur of disagreement from the crowd.
""No, listen. He's right,"" said an old man with iron-gray hair: Czernobog. He was holding a small sledgehammer, resting the head of it on his shoulder. ""They have the high ground. The weather is against us. This is madness, to begin this now.""
Something that looked a little like a wolf and a little more like a man grunted and spat on the forest floor. ""When better to attack them, dedushka? Shall we wait until the weather clears, when they expect it? I say we go now. I say we move.""
""There are clouds, between us and them,"" pointed out Isten of the Hungarians. He had a fine black moustache, a large, dusty black hat, and the grin of a man who makes his living selling aluminum siding and new roofs and gutters to senior citizens but who always leaves town the day after the checks clear whether the work is done or not.
A man in an elegant suit, who had until now said nothing, put his hands together, stepped into the firelight, and made his point succinctly and clearly. There were nods and mutters of agreement.
A voice came from one of three warrior-women who comprised the Morrigan, standing so close together in the shadows that they had become an arrangement of blue-tattooed limbs and dangling crow's wings. She said, ""It doesn't matter whether this is a good time or a bad time. This is the time. They have been killing us. They will continue to kill us, whether we fight or not. Perhaps we will triumph. Perhaps we will die. Better to die together, on the attack, like gods, than to die fleeing and singly, like rats in a cellar.""
Another murmur, this time one of deep agreement. She had said it for all of them. Now was the time.
""The first head is mine,"" said a very tall Chinese man, with a rope of tiny skulls around his neck. He began to walk, slowly and intently, up the mountain, shouldering a staff with a curved blade at the end of it, like a silver moon.
  
Even Nothing cannot last forever.
He might have been there, been Nowhere, for ten minutes or for ten thousand years. It made no difference. Time was an idea for which he no longer had any need.
He could no longer remember his real name. He felt empty and cleansed, in that place that was not a place.
He was without form, and void.
He was nothing.
And into that nothing a voice said, ""Ho-hoka, cousin. We got to talk.""
And something that might once have been Shadow said, ""Whiskey Jack?""
""Yeah,"" said Whiskey Jack, in the darkness. ""You are a hard man to hunt down, when you're dead. You didn't go to any of the places I figured. I had to look all over before I thought of checking here. Say, you ever find your tribe?""
Shadow remembered the man and the girl in the disco beneath the spinning mirror-ball. ""I guess I found my family. But no, I never found my tribe.""
""Sorry to have to disturb you.""
""No. You aren't sorry. Let me be. I got what I wanted. I'm done.""
""They are coming for you,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""They are going to revive you.""
""But I'm done,"" said Shadow. ""It was all over and done.""
""No such thing,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""Never any such thing. We'll go to my place. You want a beer?""
He guessed he would like a beer, at that. ""Sure.""
""Get me one too. There's a cooler outside the door,"" said Whiskey Jack, and he pointed. They were in his shack.
Shadow opened the door to the shack with hands it seemed to him he had not possessed moments before. There was a plastic cooler filled with chunks of river-ice out there, and, in the ice, a dozen cans of Budweiser. He pulled out a couple of cans of beer and then sat in the doorway and looked out over the valley.
They were at the top of a hill, near a waterfall, swollen with melting snow and runoff. It fell, in stages, maybe seventy feet below them, maybe a hundred. The sun reflected from the ice which sheathed the trees that overhung the waterfall basin. The churning noise as the water crashed and fell filled the air.
""Where are we?"" asked Shadow.
""Where you were last time,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""My place. You planning on holding on to my Bud till it warms up? They aren't good like that.""
Shadow stood up and passed him the can of beer. ""You didn't have a waterfall outside your place last time I was here,"" he said.
Whiskey Jack said nothing. He popped the top of the Bud, and drank half the can in one long slow swallow. Then he said, ""You remember my nephew? Harry Bluejay? The poet? He traded his Buick for your Winnebago. Remember?""
""Sure. I didn't know he was a poet.""
Whiskey Jack raised his chin and looked proud. ""Best damn poet in America,"" he said.
He drained the rest of his can of beer, belched, and got another can, while Shadow popped open his own can of beer, and the two men sat outside on a rock, by the pale green ferns, in the morning sun, and they watched the falling water and they drank their beer. There was still snow on the ground, in the places where the shadows never lifted.
The earth was muddy and wet.
""Harry was diabetic,"" continued Whiskey Jack. ""It happens. Too much. You people came to America, you take our sugar cane, potatoes and corn, then you sell us potato chips and caramel popcorn, and we're the ones who get sick."" He sipped his beer, reflecting. ""He'd won a couple of prizes for his poetry. There were people in Minnesota who wanted to put his poems into a book. He was driving to Minnesota in a sports car to talk to them. He had traded your 'Bago for a yellow Miata. The doctors said they think he went into a coma while he was driving, went off the road, ran the car into one of your road signs. Too lazy to look at where you are, to read the mountains and the clouds, you people need road signs everywhere. And so Harry Bluejay went away forever, went to live with brother Wolf. So I said, nothing keeping me there any longer. I came north. Good fishing up here.""
""I'm sorry about your nephew.""
""Me too. So now I'm living here in the north. Long way from white man's diseases. White man's roads. White man's road signs. White man's yellow Miatas. White man's caramel popcorn.""
""White man's beer?""
Whiskey Jack looked at the can. ""When you people finally give up and go home, you can leave us the Budweiser breweries,"" he said.
""Where are we?"" asked Shadow. ""Am I on the tree? Am I dead? Am I here? I thought everything was finished. What's real?""
""Yes,"" said Whiskey Jack.
""Yes? What kind of an answer is Yes?""
""It's a good answer. True answer, too.""
Shadow said, ""Are you a god as well?""
Whiskey Jack shook his head. ""I'm a culture hero,"" he said. ""We do the same shit gods do, we just screw up more and nobody worships us. They tell stories about us, but they tell the ones which make us look bad along with the ones where we came out fairly okay.""
""I see,"" said Shadow. And he did see, more or less.
""Look,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""This is not a good country for gods. My people figured that out early on. There are creator spirits who found the earth or made it or shit it out, but you think about it: who's going to worship Coyote? He made love to Porcupine Woman and got his dick shot through with more needles than a pincushion. He'd argue with rocks and the rocks would win.
""So, yeah, my people figured that maybe there's something at the back of it all, a creator, a great spirit, and so we say thank you to it, because it's always good to say thank you. But we never built churches. We didn't need to. The land was the church. The land was the religion. The land was older and wiser than the people who walked on it. It gave us salmon and corn and buffalo and passenger pigeons. It gave us wild rice and walleye. It gave us melon and squash and turkey. And we were the children of the land, just like the porcupine and the skunk and the blue jay.""
He finished his second beer and gestured toward the river at the bottom of the waterfall. ""You follow that river for a way, you'll get to the lakes where the wild rice grows. In wild rice time, you go out in your canoe with a friend, and you knock the wild rice into your canoe, and cook it, and store it, and it will keep you for a long time. Different places grow different foods. Go far enough south there are orange trees, lemon trees, and those squashy green guys, look like pears-""
""Avocados.""
""Avocados,"" agreed Whiskey Jack. ""That's them. They don't grow up this way. This is wild rice country. Moose country. What I'm trying to say is that America is like that. It's not good growing country for gods. They don't grow well here. They're like avocados trying to grow in wild rice country.""
""They may not grow well,"" said Shadow, remembering, ""but they're going to war.""
That was the only time he ever saw Whiskey Jack laugh. It was almost a bark, and it had little humor in it. ""Hey, Shadow,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""If all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you jump off too?""
""Maybe."" Shadow felt good. He didn't think it was just the beer. He couldn't remember the last time he had felt so alive, and so together.
""It's not going to be a war.""
""Then what is it?""
Whiskey Jack crushed the beer can between his hands, pressing it until it was flat. ""Look,"" he said, and pointed to the waterfall. The sun was high enough that it caught the waterfall spray: a rainbow nimbus hung in the air. Shadow thought it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.
""It's going to be a bloodbath,"" said Whiskey Jack, flatly.
Shadow saw it then. He saw it all, stark in its simplicity. He shook his head, then he began to chuckle, and he shook his head some more, and the chuckle became a full-throated laugh.
""You okay?""
""I'm fine,"" said Shadow. ""I just saw the hidden Indians. Not all of them. But I saw them anyhow.""
""Probably Ho Chunk, then. Those guys never could hide worth a damn."" He looked up at the sun. ""Time to go back,"" he said. He stood up.
""It's a two-man con,"" said Shadow. ""It's not a war at all, is it?""
Whiskey Jack patted Shadow's arm. ""You're not so dumb,"" he said.
They walked back to Whiskey Jack's shack. He opened the door. Shadow hesitated. ""I wish I could stay here with you,"" he said. ""This seems like a good place.""
""There are a lot of good places,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""That's kind of the point. Listen, gods die when they are forgotten. People too. But the land's still here. The good places, and the bad. The land isn't going anywhere. And neither am I.""
Shadow closed the door. Something was pulling at him. He was alone in the darkness once more, but the darkness became brighter and brighter until it was burning like the sun.
And then the pain began.
  
There was a woman who walked through a meadow, and spring flowers blossomed where she had passed. In this place and at this time, she called herself Easter.
She passed a place where, long ago, a farmhouse had stood. Even today several walls were still standing, jutting out of the weeds and the meadow-grass like rotten teeth. A thin rain was falling. The clouds were dark and low, and it was cold.
A little way beyond the place where the farmhouse had been there was a tree, a huge silver-gray tree, winter-dead to all appearances, and leafless, and in front of the tree, on the grass, were frayed clumps of colorless fabric. The woman stopped at the fabric, and bent down, and picked up something brownish-white: it was a much-gnawed fragment of bone which might, once, have been a part of a human skull. She tossed it back down onto the grass.
Then she looked at the man on the tree and she smiled wryly. ""They just aren't as interesting naked,"" she said. ""It's the unwrapping that's half the fun. Like with gifts, and eggs.""
The hawk-headed man who walked beside her looked down at his penis and seemed, for the first time, to become aware of his own nakedness. He said, ""I can look at the sun without even blinking.""
""That's very clever of you,"" Easter told him, reassuringly. ""Now, let's get him down from there.""
The wet ropes that held Shadow to the tree had long ago weathered and rotted, and they parted easily as the two people pulled on them. The body on the tree slipped and slid down toward the roots. They caught him as he fell, and they took him up, carrying him easily, although he was a very big man, and they put him down in the gray meadow.
The body on the grass was cold, and it did not breathe. There was a patch of dried black blood on its side, as if it had been stabbed with a spear.
""What now?""
""Now,"" she said, ""we warm him. You know what you have to do.""
""I know. I cannot.""
""If you are not willing to help, then you should not have called me here.""
""But it has been too long.""
""It has been too long for all of us.""
""And I am quite mad.""
""I know."" She reached out a white hand to Horus, and she touched his black hair. He blinked at her, intently. Then he shimmered, as if in a heat haze.
The hawk eye that faced her glinted orange, as if a flame had just been kindled inside it; a flame that had been long extinguished.
The hawk took to the air, and it swung upward, circling and ascending in a rising gyre, circling the place in the gray clouds where the sun might conceivably be, and as the hawk rose it became first a dot and then a speck, and then, to the naked eye, nothing at all, something that could only be imagined. The clouds began to thin and to evaporate, creating a patch of blue sky through which the sun glared. The single bright sunbeam penetrating the clouds and bathing the meadow was beautiful, but the image faded as more clouds vanished. Soon the morning sun was blazing down on that meadow like a summer sun at noon, burning the water vapor from the morning's rain into mists and burning the mist off into nothing at all.
The golden sun bathed the body on the floor of the meadow with its radiance and its heat. Shades of pink and of warm brown touched the dead thing.
The woman dragged the fingers of her right hand lightly across the body's chest. She imagined she could feel a shiver in his breast-something that was not a heartbeat, but still...She let her hand remain there, on his chest, just above his heart.
She lowered her lips to Shadow's lips, and she breathed into his lungs, a gentle in and out, and then the breath became a kiss. Her kiss was gentle, and it tasted of spring rains and meadow flowers.
The wound in his side began to flow with liquid blood once more-a scarlet blood, which oozed like liquid rubies in the sunlight, and then the bleeding stopped.
She kissed his cheek and his forehead. ""Come on,"" she said. ""Time to get up. It's all happening. You don't want to miss it.""
His eyes fluttered, and then they opened, two eyes of a gray so deep it was colorless, the gray of evening, and he looked at her.
She smiled, and then she removed her hand from his chest.
He said, ""You called me back."" He said it slowly, as if he had forgotten how to speak English. There was hurt in his voice, and puzzlement.
""Yes.""
""I was done. I was judged. It was over. You called me back. You dared.""
""I'm sorry.""
""Yes.""
He sat up, slowly. He winced, and touched his side. Then he looked puzzled: there was a beading of wet blood there, but there was no wound beneath it.
He reached out a hand, and she put her arm around him and helped him to his feet. He looked across the meadow as if he was trying to remember the names of the things he was looking at: the flowers in the long grass, the ruins of the farmhouse, the haze of green buds that fogged the branches of the huge silver tree.
""Do you remember?"" she asked. ""Do you remember what you learned?""
""Yes. It will fade though. Like a dream. I know that. I lost my name, and I lost my heart. And you brought me back.""
""I'm sorry,"" she said, for the second time. ""They are going to fight, soon. The old gods and the new ones.""
""You want me to fight for you? You wasted your time.""
""I brought you back because that was what I had to do,"" she said. ""It's what I can do. It's what I'm best at. What you do now is whatever you have to do. Your call. I did my part."" Suddenly, she became aware of his nakedness, and she blushed a burning scarlet flush, and she looked down and away.
  
In the rain and the cloud, shadows moved up the side of the mountain, up to the rock pathways.
White foxes padded up the hill in company with red-haired men in green jackets. There was a bull-headed minotaur walking beside an iron-fingered dactyl. A pig, a monkey, and a sharp-toothed ghoul clambered up the hillside, in company with a blue-skinned man holding a flaming bow, a bear with flowers twined into its fur, and a man in golden chain mail holding his sword of eyes.
Beautiful Antinous, who was the lover of Hadrian, walked up the hillside at the head of a company of leather queens, their arms and chests steroid-swollen and sculpted into perfect shapes.
A gray-skinned man, his one cyclopean eye a huge cabochon emerald, walked stiffly up the hill, ahead of several squat and swarthy men, their impassive faces as regular as Aztec carvings: they knew the secrets that the jungles had swallowed.
A sniper at the top of the hill took careful aim at a white fox, and fired. There was an explosion, and a puff of cordite, gunpowder scent on the wet air. The corpse was a young Japanese woman with her stomach blown away, and her face all bloody. Slowly, the corpse began to fade.
The people continued up the hill, on two legs, on four legs, on no legs at all.
  
The drive through the Tennessee mountain country had been startlingly beautiful whenever the storm had eased, and nerve-wracking whenever the rain had pelted down. Town and Laura had talked and talked and talked the whole way. He was so glad he had met her. It was like meeting an old friend, a really good old friend you'd simply never met before. They talked history and movies and music, and she turned out to be the only person, and I mean the only other person, he had ever met who had seen a foreign film (Mr. Town was sure it was Spanish, while Laura was just as certain it was Polish) from the sixties called The Manuscript Found in Saragossa, a film he had been starting to believe he had hallucinated.
When Laura pointed out the first SEE ROCK CITY barn to him he chuckled and admitted that that was where he was headed. She said that was so cool. She always wanted to visit those kinds of places, but she never made the time, and always regretted it later. That was why she was on the road right now. She was having an adventure.
She was a travel agent, she told him. Separated from her husband. She admitted that she didn't think they could ever get back together, and said it was her fault.
""I can't believe that.""
She sighed. ""It's true, Mack. I'm just not the woman he married anymore.""
Well, he told her, people change, and before he could think he was telling her everything he could tell her about his life, he was even telling her about Woody and Stoner, how the three of them were the three musketeers, and the two of them were killed, you think you'd get hardened to that kind of thing in government work, but you never did. It never happened.
And she reached out one hand-it was cold enough that he turned up the car's heating-and squeezed his hand tightly in hers.
Lunchtime, they ate bad Japanese food while a thunderstorm lowered on Knoxville, and Town didn't care that the food was late, that the miso soup was cold, or that the sushi was warm.
He loved the fact that she was out, with him, having an adventure.
""Well,"" confided Laura, ""I hated the idea of getting stale. I was just rotting away where I was. So I set off without my car and without my credit cards. I'm just relying on the kindness of strangers. And I've had the best time. People have been so good to me.""
""Aren't you scared?"" he asked. ""I mean, you could be stranded, you could be mugged, you could starve.""
She shook her head. Then she said, with a hesitant smile, ""I met you, didn't I?"" and he couldn't find anything to say.
When the meal was over they ran through the storm to his car holding Japanese-language newspapers to cover their heads, and they laughed as they ran, like schoolchildren in the rain.
""How far can I take you?"" he asked, when they made it back into the car. ""I'll go as far as you're going, Mack,"" she told him, shyly.
He was glad he hadn't used the Big Mack line. This woman wasn't a bar-room one-nighter, Mr. Town knew that in his soul. It might have taken him fifty years to find her, but this was finally it, this was the one, this wild, magical woman with the long dark hair.
This was love.
""Look,"" he said, as they approached Chattanooga. The wipers slooshed the rain across the windshield, blurring the gray of the city. ""How about I find a motel for you tonight? I'll pay for it. And once I make my delivery, we can. Well, we can take a hot bath together, for a start. Warm you up.""
""That sounds wonderful,"" said Laura. ""What are you delivering?""
""That stick,"" he told her, and chuckled. ""The one on the back seat.""
""Okay,"" she said, humoring him. ""Then don't tell me, Mister Mysterious.""
He told her it would be best if she waited in the car in the Rock City parking lot while he made his delivery. He drove up the side of Lookout Mountain in the gusting rain, never breaking thirty miles per hour, with his headlights burning.
They parked at the back of the parking lot. He turned off the engine.
""Hey. Mack. Before you get out of the car, don't I get a hug?"" asked Laura with a smile.
""You surely do,"" said Mr. Town, and he put his arms around her, and she snuggled close to him while the rain pattered a tattoo on the roof of the Ford Explorer. He could smell her hair. There was a faintly unpleasant scent beneath the perfume. Travel would do it, every time. That bath, he decided, was a real must for both of them. He wondered if there was anyplace in Chattanooga where he could get those scented bath bombs his first wife had loved so much. Laura raised her head against his, and her hand stroked the line of his neck, absently.
""Mack...I keep thinking. You must really want to know what happened to those friends of yours,"" she said. ""Woody and Stone. Do you?""
""Yeah,"" he said, moving his lips down to hers, for their first kiss. ""Sure I do.""
So she showed him.
  
Shadow walked the meadow, making his own slow circles around the trunk of the tree, gradually widening his circle. Sometimes he would stop and pick something up: a flower, or a leaf, or a pebble, or a twig, or a blade of grass. He would examine it minutely, as if concentrating entirely on the twigness of the twig, the leafness of the leaf, as if he were seeing it for the first time.
Easter found herself reminded of the gaze of a baby, at the point where it learns to focus.
She did not dare to talk to him. At that moment, it would have been sacrilegious. She watched him, exhausted as she was, and she wondered.
About twenty feet out from the base of the tree, half-overgrown with long meadow-grass and dead creepers, he found a canvas bag. Shadow picked it up, untied the knots at the top of the bag, loosened the draw-string.
The clothes he pulled out were his own. They were old, but still serviceable. He turned the shoes over in his hands. He stroked the fabric of the shirt, the wool of the sweater, stared at them as if he were looking at them across a million years.
For some time he looked at them, then, one by one, he put them on.
He put his hands into his pockets, and looked puzzled as he pulled one hand out holding what looked to Easter like a white and gray marble.
He said, ""No coins."" It was the first thing he had said in several hours.
""No coins?"" echoed Easter.
He shook his head. ""It was good to have the coins,"" he said. ""They gave me something to do with my hands."" He bent down to pull on his shoes.
Once he was dressed, he looked more normal. Grave, though. She wondered how far he had traveled, and what it had cost him to return. He was not the first whose return she had initiated, and she knew that, soon enough, the million-year stare would fade, and the memories and the dreams that he had brought back from the tree would be elided by the world of things you could touch. That was the way it always went.
She led their way to the rear of the meadow. Her mount waited in the trees.
""It can't carry both of us,"" she told him. ""I'll make my own way home.""
Shadow nodded. He seemed to be trying to remember something. Then he opened his mouth, and he screeched a cry of welcome and of joy.
The thunderbird opened its cruel beak, and it screeched a welcome back at him.
Superficially, at least, it resembled a condor. Its feathers were black, with a purplish sheen, and its neck was banded with white. Its beak was black and cruel: a raptor's beak, made for tearing. At rest, on the ground, with its wings folded away, it was the size of a black bear, and its head was on a level with Shadow's own.
Horus said, proudly, ""I brought him. They live in the mountains.""
Shadow nodded. ""I had a dream of thunderbirds once,"" he said. ""Damnedest dream I ever had.""
The thunderbird opened its beak and made a surprisingly gentle noise, Crawroo? ""You heard my dream too?"" asked Shadow.
He reached out a hand and rubbed it gently against the bird's head. The thunderbird pushed up against him like an affectionate pony. He scratched it behind where the ears must have been.
Shadow turned to Easter. ""You rode him here?""
""Yes,"" she said. ""You can ride him back, if he lets you.""
""How do you ride him?""
""It's easy,"" she said. ""If you don't fall. Like riding the lightning.""
""Will I see you back there?""
She shook her head. ""I'm done, honey,"" she told him. ""You go do what you need to do. I'm tired. Bringing you back like that...it took a lot out of me. I need to rest, to save up my energies until my festival begins. I'm sorry. Good luck.""
Shadow nodded. ""Whiskey Jack. I saw him. After I passed on. He came and found me. We drank beer together.""
""Yes,"" she said. ""I'm sure you did.""
""Will I ever see you again?"" asked Shadow.
She looked at him with eyes the green of ripening corn. She said nothing. Then, abruptly, she shook her head. ""I doubt it,"" she said.
Shadow clambered awkwardly onto the thunderbird's back. He felt like a mouse on the back of a hawk. There was an ozone taste in his mouth, metallic and blue. Something crackled. The thunderbird extended its wings, and began to flap them, hard.
As the ground fell away beneath them, Shadow clung on, his heart pounding in his chest like a wild thing.
It was exactly like riding the lightning.
  
Laura took the stick from the back seat of the car. She left Mr. Town in the front seat of the Ford Explorer, and climbed out of the car, and walked through the rain to Rock City. The ticket office was closed. The door to the gift shop was not locked and she walked through it, past the rock candy and the display of SEE ROCK CITY birdhouses, into the Eighth Wonder of the World.
Nobody challenged her, although she passed several men and women on the path, in the rain. Many of them looked faintly artificial; several of them were translucent. She walked across a swinging rope bridge. She passed the white deer gardens, and pushed herself through the Fat Man's Squeeze, where the path ran between two rock walls.
And, in the end, she stepped over a chain, with a sign on it telling her that this part of the attraction was closed, and she went into a cavern, and she saw a man sitting on a plastic chair, in front of a diorama of drunken gnomes. He was reading the Washington Post by the light of a small electric lantern. When he saw her he folded the paper and placed it beneath his chair. He stood up, a tall man with close-cropped orange hair in an expensive raincoat, and he gave her a small bow.
""I shall assume that Mister Town is dead,"" he said. ""Welcome, spear-carrier.""
""Thank you. I'm sorry about Mack,"" she said. ""Were you friends?""
""Not at all. He should have kept himself alive, if he wanted to keep his job. But you brought his stick."" He looked her up and down with eyes that glimmered like the orange embers of a dying fire. ""I am afraid you have the advantage of me. They call me Mister World, here at the top of the hill.""
""I'm Shadow's wife.""
""Of course. The lovely Laura,"" he said. ""I should have recognized you. He had several photographs of you up above his bed, in the cell that once we shared. And, if you don't mind my saying so, you are looking lovelier than you have any right to look. Shouldn't you be further along on the whole road-to-rot-and-ruin business by now?""
""I was,"" she said simply. ""I was much further along. I'm not sure what changed. I know when I started feeling better. It was this morning. Those women, in the farm, they gave me water from their well.""
An eyebrow raised. ""Urd's Well? Surely not.""
She pointed to herself. Her skin was pale, and her eye-sockets were dark, but she was manifestly whole: if she was indeed a walking corpse, she was freshly dead.
""It won't last,"" said Mr. World. ""The Norns gave you a little taste of the past. It will dissolve into the present soon enough, and then those pretty blue eyes will roll out of their sockets and ooze down those pretty cheeks, which will, by then, of course, no longer be so pretty. By the way, you have my stick. Can I have it, please?""
He pulled out a pack of Lucky Strikes, took a cigarette, lit it with a disposable black Bic.
She said, ""Can I have one of those?""
""Sure. I'll give you a cigarette if you give me my stick.""
""No,"" she said. ""If you want it, it's worth more than just a cigarette.""
He said nothing.
She said, ""I want answers. I want to know things.""
He lit a cigarette and passed it to her. She took it and inhaled. Then she blinked. ""I can almost taste this one,"" she said. ""I think maybe I can."" She smiled. ""Mm. Nicotine.""
""Yes,"" he said. ""Why did you go to the women in the farmhouse?""
""Shadow told me to go to them,"" she said. ""He said to ask them for water.""
""I wonder if he knew what it would do. Probably not. Still, that's the good thing about having him dead on his tree. I know where he is at all times, now. He's off the board.""
""You set up my husband,"" she said. ""You set him up all the way, you people. He has a good heart, you know that?""
""Yes,"" said Mr. World. ""I know.""
""Why did you want him?""
""Patterns, and distraction,"" said Mr. World. ""When this is all done with, I guess I'll sharpen a stick of mistletoe and go down to the ash tree, and ram it through his eye. That's what those morons fighting out there have never been able to grasp. It's never a matter of old and new. It's only about patterns. Now. My stick, please.""
""Why do you want it?""
""It's a souvenir of this whole sorry mess,"" said Mr. World. ""Don't worry, it's not mistletoe."" He flashed a grin. ""It symbolizes a spear, and in this sorry world, the symbol is the thing.""
The noises from outside grew louder.
""Which side are you on?"" she asked.
""It's not about sides,"" he told her. ""But since you asked, I'm on the winning side. Always. That's what I do best.""
She nodded, and she did not let go of the stick. ""I can see that,"" she said.
She turned away from him, and looked out of the cavern door. Far below her, in the rocks, she could see something that glowed and pulsed. It wrapped itself around a thin, mauve-faced bearded man, who was beating at it with a squeegee stick, the kind of squeegee that people like him use to smear across car windshields at traffic lights. There was a scream, and they both disappeared from view.
""Okay. I'll give you the stick,"" she said.
Mr. World's voice came from behind her. ""Good girl,"" he said reassuringly, in a way that struck her as being both patronizing and indefinably male. It made her skin crawl.
She waited in the rock doorway until she could hear his breath in her ear. She had to wait until he got close enough. She had that much figured out.
  
The ride was more than exhilarating; it was electric.
They swept through the storm like jagged bolts of lightning, flashing from cloud to cloud; they moved like the thunder's roar, like the swell and rip of the hurricane. It was a crackling, impossible journey, and Shadow forgot to be scared almost immediately. You cannot be afraid when you ride the thunderbird. There is no fear: only the power of the storm, unstoppable and all-consuming, and the joy of the flight.
Shadow dug his fingers into the thunderbird's feathers, feeling the static prickle on his skin. Blue sparks writhed across his hands like tiny snakes. Rain washed his face.
""This is the best,"" he shouted, over the roar of the storm.
As if it understood him, the bird began to rise higher, every wing-beat a clap of thunder, and it swooped and dove and tumbled through the dark clouds.
""In my dream, I was hunting you,"" said Shadow, his words ripped away by the wind. ""In my dream. I had to bring back a feather.""
Yes. The word was a static crackle in the radio of his mind. They came to us for feathers, to prove that they were men; and they came to us to cut the stones from our heads, to give their dead our lives.
An image filled his mind then: of a thunderbird-a female, he assumed, for her plumage was brown, not black-lying freshly dead on the side of a mountain. Beside it was a woman. She was breaking open its skull with a knob of flint. She picked through the wet shards of bone and the brains until she found a smooth clear stone the tawny color of garnet, opalescent fires flickering in its depths. Eagle stones, thought Shadow. She was going to take it to her infant son, dead these last three nights, and she would lay it on his cold breast. By the next sunrise the boy would be alive and laughing, and the jewel would be gray and clouded and, like the bird it had been stolen from, quite dead.
""I understand,"" he said to the bird.
The bird threw back its head and crowed, and its cry was the thunder.
The world beneath them flashed past in one strange dream.
  
Laura adjusted her grip on the stick, and she waited for the man she knew as Mr. World to come to her. She was facing away from him, looking out at the storm, and the dark green hills below.
In this sorry world, she thought, the symbol is the thing. Yes.
She felt his hand close softly onto her right shoulder.
Good, she thought. He does not want to alarm me. He is scared that I will throw his stick out into the storm, that it will tumble down the mountainside, and he will lose it.
She leaned back, just a little, until she was touching his chest with her back. His left arm curved around her. It was an intimate gesture. His left hand was open in front of her. She closed both of her hands around the top of the stick, exhaled, concentrated.
""Please. My stick,"" he said, in her ears.
""Yes,"" she said. ""It's yours."" And then, not knowing if it would mean anything, she said, ""I dedicate this death to Shadow,"" and she stabbed the stick into her chest, just below the breastbone, felt it writhe and change in her hands as the stick became a spear.
The boundary between sensation and pain had diffused since she had died. She felt the spear head penetrate her chest, felt it push out through her back. A moment's resistance-she pushed harder-and the spear thrust into Mr. World. She could feel the warm breath of him on the cool skin of her neck, as he wailed in hurt and surprise, impaled on the spear.
She did not recognize the words he spoke, nor the language he said them in. She pushed the shaft of the spear further in, forcing it through her body, into and through his.
She could feel his hot blood spurting onto her back.
""Bitch,"" he said, in English. ""You fucking bitch."" There was a wet gurgling quality to his voice. She guessed that the blade of the spear must have sliced a lung. Mr. World was moving now, or trying to move, and every move he made rocked her too: they were joined by the pole, impaled together like two fish on a single spear. He now had a knife in one hand, she saw, and he stabbed her chest and breasts randomly and wildly with the knife, unable to see what he was doing.
She did not care. What are knife-cuts to a corpse?
She brought her fist down, hard, on his waving wrist, and the knife went flying to the floor of the cavern. She kicked it away.
And now he was crying and wailing. She could feel him pushing against her, his hands fumbling at her back, his hot tears on her neck. His blood was soaking her back, spurting down the back of her legs.
""This must look so undignified,"" she said, in a dead whisper which was not without a certain dark amusement.
She felt Mr. World stumble behind her, and she stumbled too, and then she slipped in the blood-all of it his-that was puddling on the floor of the cave, and they both went down.
  
The thunderbird landed in the Rock City parking lot. Rain was falling in sheets. Shadow could barely see a dozen feet in front of his face. He let go of the thunderbird's feathers and half-slipped, half-tumbled to the wet tarmac.
The bird looked at him. Lightning flashed, and the bird was gone.
Shadow climbed to his feet.
The parking lot was three-quarters empty. Shadow started toward the entrance. He passed a brown Ford Explorer, parked against a rock wall. There was something deeply familiar about the car, and he glanced up at it curiously, noticing the man inside the car, slumped over the steering wheel as if asleep.
Shadow pulled open the driver's door.
He had last seen Mr. Town standing outside the motel in the center of America. The expression on his face was one of surprise. His neck had been expertly broken. Shadow touched the man's face. Still warm.
Shadow could smell a scent on the air in the car; it was faint, like the perfume of someone who left a room years before, but Shadow would have known it anywhere. He slammed the door of the Explorer and made his way across the parking lot.
As he walked he felt a twinge in his side, a sharp, jabbing pain that must have only existed in his head, as it lasted for only a second, or less, and then it was gone.
There was nobody in the gift shop, nobody selling tickets. He walked through the building and out into the gardens of Rock City.
Thunder rumbled, and it rattled the branches of the trees and shook deep inside the huge rocks, and the rain fell with cold violence. It was late afternoon, but it was dark as night.
A trail of lightning speared across the clouds, and Shadow wondered if that was the thunderbird returning to its high crags, or just an atmospheric discharge, or whether the two ideas were, on some level, the same thing.
And of course they were. That was the point, after all.
Somewhere a man's voice called out. Shadow heard it. The only words he recognized or thought he recognized were ""...to Odin!""
Shadow hurried across Seven States Flag Court, the flagstones now running fast with a dangerous amount of rainwater. Once he slipped on the slick stone. There was a thick layer of cloud surrounding the mountain, and in the gloom and the storm beyond the courtyard he could see no states at all.
There was no sound. The place seemed utterly abandoned.
He called out, and imagined he heard something answering. He walked toward the place from which he thought the sound had come.
Nobody. Nothing. Just a chain marking the entrance to a cave as off-limits to guests.
Shadow stepped over the chain.
He looked around, peering into the darkness.
His skin prickled.
A voice from behind him, in the shadows, said, very quietly, ""You have never disappointed me.""
Shadow did not turn. ""That's weird,"" he said. ""I disappointed myself all the way. Every time.""
""Not at all,"" chuckled the voice. ""You did everything you were meant to do, and more. You took everybody's attention, so they never looked at the hand with the coin in it. It's called misdirection. And there's power in the sacrifice of a son-power enough, and more than enough, to get the whole ball rolling. To tell the truth, I'm proud of you.""
""It was crooked,"" said Shadow. ""All of it. None of it was for real. It was just a set-up for a massacre.""
""Exactly,"" said Wednesday's voice from the shadows. ""It was crooked. But it was the only game in town.""
""I want Laura,"" said Shadow. ""I want Loki. Where are they?""
There was only silence. A spray of rain gusted at him. Thunder rumbled somewhere close at hand.
He walked further in.
Loki Lie-Smith sat on the ground with his back to a metal cage. Inside the cage, drunken pixies tended their still. He was covered with a blanket. Only his face showed, and his hands, white and long, came around the blanket. An electric lantern sat on a chair beside him. The lantern's batteries were close to failing, and the light it cast was faint and yellow.
He looked pale, and he looked rough.
His eyes, though. His eyes were still fiery, and they glared at Shadow as he walked through the cavern.
When Shadow was several paces from Loki, he stopped.
""You are too late,"" said Loki. His voice was raspy and wet. ""I have thrown the spear. I have dedicated the battle. It has begun.""
""No shit,"" said Shadow.
""No shit,"" said Loki. ""It does not matter what you do any more. It is too late.""
""Okay,"" said Shadow. He stopped and thought. Then he said, ""You say there's some spear you had to throw to kick off the battle. Like the whole Uppsala thing. This is the battle you'll be feeding on. Am I right?""
Silence. He could hear Loki breathing, a ghastly rattling inhalation.
""I figured it out,"" said Shadow. ""Kind of. I'm not sure when I figured it out. Maybe when I was hanging on the tree. Maybe before. It was from something Wednesday said to me, at Christmas.""
Loki just stared at him, saying nothing.
""It's just a two-man con,"" said Shadow. ""Like the bishop and the diamond necklace and the cop. Like the guy with the fiddle, and the guy who wants to buy the fiddle, and the poor sap in between them who pays for the fiddle. Two men, who appear to be on opposite sides, playing the same game.""
Loki whispered, ""You are ridiculous.""
""Why? I liked what you did at the motel. That was smart. You needed to be there, to make sure that everything went according to plan. I saw you. I even realized who you were. And I still never twigged that you were their Mister World. Or maybe I did, somewhere down deep. I knew I knew your voice, anyway.""
Shadow raised his voice. ""You can come out,"" he said, to the cavern. ""Wherever you are. Show yourself.""
The wind howled in the opening of the cavern, and it drove a spray of rainwater in toward them. Shadow shivered.
""I'm tired of being played for a sucker,"" said Shadow. ""Show yourself. Let me see you.""
There was a change in the shadows at the back of the cave. Something became more solid; something shifted. ""You know too damned much, m'boy,"" said Wednesday's familiar rumble.
""So they didn't kill you.""
""They killed me,"" said Wednesday, from the shadows. ""None of this would have worked if they hadn't."" His voice was faint-not actually quiet, but there was a quality to it that made Shadow think of an old radio not quite tuned in to a distant station. ""If I hadn't died for real, we could never have got them here,"" said Wednesday. ""Kali and the Morrigan and the Loa and the fucking Albanians and-well, you've seen them all. It was my death that drew them all together. I was the sacrificial lamb.""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""You were the Judas Goat.""
The wraith-shape in the shadows swirled and shifted. ""Not at all. That implies that I was betraying the old gods for the new. Which was not what we were doing.""
""Not at all,"" whispered Loki.
""I can see that,"" said Shadow. ""You two weren't betraying either side. You were betraying both sides.""
""I guess we were at that,"" said Wednesday. He sounded pleased with himself.
""You wanted a massacre. You needed a blood sacrifice. A sacrifice of gods.""
The wind grew stronger; the howl across the cave door became a screech, as if of something immeasurably huge in pain.
""And why the hell not? I've been trapped in this damned land for almost twelve hundred years. My blood is thin. I'm hungry.""
""And you two feed on death,"" said Shadow.
He thought he could see Wednesday, now, standing in the shadows. Behind him-through him-were the bars of a cage which held what looked like plastic leprechauns. He was a shape made of darkness, who became more real the more Shadow looked away from him, allowed him to take shape in his peripheral vision.
""I feed on death that is dedicated to me,"" said Wednesday.
""Like my death on the tree,"" said Shadow.
""That,"" said Wednesday, ""was special.""
""And do you also feed on death?"" asked Shadow, looking at Loki.
Loki shook his head, wearily.
""No, of course not,"" said Shadow. ""You feed on chaos.""
Loki smiled at that, a brief pained smile, and orange flames danced in his eyes, and flickered like burning lace beneath his pale skin.
""We couldn't have done it without you,"" said Wednesday, from the corner of Shadow's eye. ""I'd been with so many women...""
""You needed a son,"" said Shadow.
Wednesday's ghost-voice echoed. ""I needed you, my boy. Yes. My own boy. I knew that you had been conceived, but your mother left the country. It took us so long to find you. And when we did find you, you were in prison. We needed to find out what made you tick. What buttons we could press to make you move. Who you were."" Loki looked, momentarily, pleased with himself. Shadow wanted to hit him. ""And you had a wife to go back home to. It was unfortunate. Not insurmountable.""
""She was no good for you,"" whispered Loki. ""You were better off without her.""
""If it could have been any other way,"" said Wednesday, and this time Shadow knew what he meant.
""And if she'd had-the grace-to stay dead,"" panted Loki. ""Wood and Stone-were good men. You were going-to be allowed to escape-when the train crossed the Dakotas...""
""Where is she?"" asked Shadow.
Loki reached a pale arm, and pointed to the back of the cavern.
""She went that-a-way,"" he said. Then, without warning, he tipped forward, his body collapsing onto the rock floor.
Shadow saw what the blanket had hidden from him; the pool of blood, the hole through Loki's back, the fawn raincoat soaked black with blood. ""What happened?"" he said.
Loki said nothing.
Shadow did not think he would be saying anything any more.
""Your wife happened to him, m'boy,"" said Wednesday's distant voice. He had become harder to see, as if he was fading back into the ether. ""But the battle will bring him back. As the battle will bring me back for good. I'm a ghost, and he's a corpse, but we've still won. The game was rigged.""
""Rigged games,"" said Shadow, remembering, ""are the easiest to beat.""
There was no answer. Nothing moved in the shadows.
Shadow said, ""Goodbye,"" and then he said, ""Father."" But by then there was no trace of anybody else in the cavern. Nobody at all.
Shadow walked back up to the Seven States Flag Court, but saw nobody, and heard nothing but the crack and whip of the flags in the storm-wind. There were no people with swords at the Thousand-Ton Balanced Rock, no defenders of the Swing-A-Long Bridge. He was alone.
There was nothing to see. The place was deserted. It was an empty battlefield.
No. Not deserted. Not exactly.
He was just in the wrong place.
This was Rock City. It had been a place of awe and worship for thousands of years; today the millions of tourists who walked through the gardens and swung their way across the Swing-A-Long Bridge had the same effect as water turning a million prayer wheels. Reality was thin here. And Shadow knew where the battle must be taking place.
With that, he began to walk. He remembered how he had felt on the Carousel, tried to feel like that, but in a new moment of time...
He remembered turning the Winnebago, shifting it at right angles to everything. He tried to capture that sensation-
And then, easily and perfectly, it happened.
It was like pushing through a membrane, like plunging up from deep water into air. With one step he had moved from the tourist path on the mountain to...
To somewhere real. He was Backstage.
He was still on the top of a mountain. That much remained the same. But it was so much more than that. This mountaintop was the quintessence of place, the heart of things as they were. Compared to it, the Lookout Mountain he had left was a painting on a backdrop, or a papiermâché model seen on a TV screen-merely a representation of the thing, not the thing itself.
This was the true place.
The rock walls formed a natural amphitheater. Paths of stone wound around and across it, forming twisty natural bridges that Eschered through and across the rock walls.
And the sky...
The sky was dark. It was lit, and the world beneath it was illuminated, by a burning greenish-white streak, brighter than the sun, which forked crazily across the sky from end to end, like a white rip in the darkened sky.
It was lightning, Shadow realized. Lightning held in one frozen moment that stretched into forever. The light it cast was harsh and unforgiving: it washed out faces, hollowed eyes into dark pits.
This was the moment of the storm.
The paradigms were shifting. He could feel it. The old world, a world of infinite vastness and illimitable resources and future, was being confronted by something else-a web of energy, of opinions, of gulfs.
People believe, thought Shadow. It's what people do. They believe. And then they will not take responsibility for their beliefs; they conjure things, and do not trust the conjurations. People populate the darkness; with ghosts, with gods, with electrons, with tales. People imagine, and people believe: and it is that belief, that rock-solid belief, that makes things happen.
The mountaintop was an arena; he saw that immediately. And on each side of the arena he could see them arrayed.
They were too big. Everything was too big in that place.
There were old gods in that place: gods with skins the brown of old mushrooms, the pink of chicken-flesh, the yellow of autumn leaves. Some were crazy and some were sane. Shadow recognized the old gods. He'd met them already, or he'd met others like them. There were ifrits and piskies, giants and dwarfs. He saw the woman he had met in the darkened bedroom in Rhode Island, saw the writhing green snake-coils of her hair. He saw Mama-ji, from the Carousel, and there was blood on her hands and a smile on her face. He knew them all.
He recognized the new ones, too.
There was somebody who had to be a railroad baron, in an antique suit, his watch-chain stretched across his vest. He had the air of one who had seen better days. His forehead twitched.
There were the great gray gods of the airplanes, heirs to all the dreams of heavier-than-air travel.
There were car gods there: a powerful, serious-faced contingent, with blood on their black gloves and on their chrome teeth: recipients of human sacrifice on a scale undreamed-of since the Aztecs. Even they looked uncomfortable. Worlds change.
Others had faces of smudged phosphors; they glowed gently, as if they existed in their own light.
Shadow felt sorry for them all.
There was an arrogance to the new ones. Shadow could see that. But there was also a fear.
They were afraid that unless they kept pace with a changing world, unless they remade and redrew and rebuilt the world in their image, their time would already be over.
Each side faced the other with bravery. To each side, the opposition were the demons, the monsters, the damned.
Shadow could see an initial skirmish had taken place. There was already blood on the rocks.
They were readying themselves for the real battle; for the real war. It was now or never, he thought. If he did not move now, it would be too late.
In America everything goes on forever, said a voice in the back of his head. The 1950s lasted for a thousand years. You have all the time in the world.
Shadow walked in something that was half a stroll, half a controlled stumble, into the center of the arena.
He could feel eyes on him, eyes and things that were not eyes. He shivered.
The buffalo voice said, You are doing just fine.
Shadow thought, Damn right. I came back from the dead this morning. After that, everything else should be a piece of cake.
""You know,"" said Shadow, to the air, in a conversational voice, ""this is not a war. This was never intended to be a war. And if any of you think this is a war, you are deluding yourselves."" He heard grumbling noises from both sides. He had impressed nobody.
""We are fighting for our survival,"" lowed a minotaur from one side of the arena.
""We are fighting for our existence,"" shouted a mouth in a pillar of glittering smoke, from the other.
""This is a bad land for gods,"" said Shadow. As an opening statement it wasn't Friends, Romans, Countrymen, but it would do. ""You've probably all learned that, in your own way. The old gods are ignored. The new gods are as quickly taken up as they are abandoned, cast aside for the next big thing. Either you've been forgotten, or you're scared you're going to be rendered obsolete, or maybe you're just getting tired of existing on the whim of people.""
The grumbles were fewer now. He had said something they agreed with. Now, while they were listening, he had to tell them the story.
""There was a god who came here from a far land, and whose power and influence waned as belief in him faded. He was a god who took his power from sacrifice, and from death, and especially from war. He would have deaths of those who fell in war dedicated to him-whole battlefields which, in the old country, gave him power and sustenance.
""Now he was old. He made his living as a grifter, working with another god from his pantheon, a god of chaos and deceit. Together they rooked the gullible. Together they took people for all they'd got.
""Somewhere in there-maybe fifty years ago, maybe a hundred-they put a plan into motion, a plan to create a reserve of power they could both tap into. Something that would make them stronger than they had ever been. After all, what could be more powerful than a battlefield covered with dead gods? The game they played was called 'Let's You and Him Fight.'
""Do you see?
""The battle you're here to fight isn't something that any of you can win or lose. The winning and the losing are unimportant to him, to them. What matters is that enough of you die. Each of you that falls in battle gives him power. Every one of you that dies, feeds him. Do you understand?""
The roaring, whoompfing sound of something catching on fire echoed across the arena. Shadow looked to the place the noise came from. An enormous man, his skin the deep brown of mahogany, his chest naked, wearing a top hat, cigar sticking rakishly from his mouth, spoke in a voice as deep as the grave. Baron Samedi said, ""Okay. But Odin. He died. At the peace talks. Motherfuckers killed him. He died. I know death. Nobody goin' to fool me about death.""
Shadow said, ""Obviously. He had to die for real. He sacrificed his physical body to make this war happen. After the battle he would have been more powerful than he had ever been.""
Somebody called, ""Who are you?""
""I am-I was-I am his son.""
One of the new gods-Shadow suspected it was a drug from the way it smiled and spangled and shivered-said, ""But Mister World said-""
""There was no Mister World. There never was. He was just another one of you bastards trying to feed on the chaos he created."" He could see that they believed him, and he could see the hurt in their eyes.
Shadow shook his head. ""You know,"" he said, ""I think I would rather be a man than a god. We don't need anyone to believe in us. We just keep going anyhow. It's what we do.""
There was silence, in the high place.
And then, with a shocking crack, the lightning bolt frozen in the sky crashed to the mountaintop, and the arena went entirely dark.
They glowed, many of those presences, in the darkness.
Shadow wondered if they were going to argue with him, to attack him, to try to kill him. He waited for some kind of response.
And then Shadow realized that the lights were going out. The gods were leaving that place, first in handfuls, and then by scores, and finally in their hundreds.
A spider the size of a rottweiler scuttled heavily toward him, on seven legs; its cluster of eyes glowed faintly.
Shadow held his ground, although he felt slightly sick.
When the spider got close enough, it said, in Mr. Nancy's voice, ""That was a good job. Proud of you. You done good, kid.""
""Thank you,"" said Shadow.
""We should get you back. Too long in this place is goin' to mess you up."" It rested one brown-haired spider-leg on Shadow's shoulder...
  
... and, back on Seven States Flag Court, Mr. Nancy coughed. His right hand rested on Shadow's shoulder. The rain had stopped. Mr. Nancy held his left hand across his side, as if it hurt. Shadow asked if he was okay.
""I'm tough as old nails,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""Tougher."" He did not sound happy. He sounded like an old man in pain.
There were dozens of them, standing or sitting on the ground or on the benches. Some of them looked badly injured.
Shadow could hear a rattling noise in the sky, approaching from the south. He looked at Mr. Nancy. ""Helicopters?""
Mr. Nancy nodded. ""Don't you worry about them. Not any more. They'll just clean up the mess, and leave. They're good at it.""
""Got it.""
Shadow knew that there was one part of the mess he wanted to see for himself, before it was cleaned up. He borrowed a flashlight from a gray-haired man who looked like a retired news anchor and began to hunt.
He found Laura stretched out on the ground in a side-cavern, beside a diorama of mining gnomes straight out of Snow White. The floor beneath her was sticky with blood. She was on her side, where Loki must have dropped her after he had pulled the spear out of them both.
One of Laura's hands clutched her chest. She looked dreadfully vulnerable. She also looked dead, but then Shadow was almost used to that by now.
Shadow squatted beside her, and he touched her cheek with his hand, and he said her name. Her eyes opened, and she lifted her head and turned it until she was looking at him.
""Hello, puppy,"" she said. Her voice was thin.
""Hi, Laura. What happened here?""
""Nothing,"" she said. ""Just stuff. Did they win?""
""I don't know,"" said Shadow. ""I think these things are kind of relative. But I stopped the battle they were trying to start.""
""My clever puppy,"" she said. ""That man, Mister World, he said he was going to put a stick through your eye. I didn't like him at all.""
""He's dead. You killed him, hon.""
She nodded. She said, ""That's good.""
Her eyes closed. Shadow's hand found her cold hand, and he held it in his. In time she opened her eyes again.
""Did you ever figure out how to bring me back from the dead?"" she asked.
""I guess,"" he said. ""I know one way, anyway.""
""That's good,"" she said. She squeezed his hand with her cold hand. And then she said, ""And the opposite? What about that?""
""The opposite?""
""Yes,"" she whispered. ""I think I must have earned it.""
""I don't want to do that.""
She said nothing. She simply waited.
Shadow said, ""Okay."" Then he took his hand from hers and put it to her neck.
She said, ""That's my husband."" She said it proudly.
""I love you, babes,"" said Shadow.
""Love you, puppy,"" she whispered.
He closed his hand around the golden coin that hung around her neck. He tugged, hard, at the chain, which snapped easily. Then he took the gold coin between his finger and thumb, and blew on it, and opened his hand wide.
The coin was gone.
Her eyes were still open, but they did not move.
He bent down then, and kissed her, gently, on her cold cheek, but she did not respond. He did not expect her to. Then he got up and walked out of the cavern, to stare into the night.
The storms had cleared. The air felt fresh and clean and new once more.
Tomorrow, he had no doubt, would be one hell of a beautiful day.

Epilogue: Something That the Dead Are Keeping Back 
AG_ch9	AG	American Gods	9	9034	49684	CHAPTER NINE 

Not to mention mythic creatures in the rubble....
-WENDY COPE, ""A POLICEMAN'S LOT"" 
As they drove out of Illinois late that evening, Shadow asked Wednesday his first question. He saw the WELCOME TO WISCONSIN sign, and said, ""So who were the bunch that grabbed me in the parking lot? Mister Wood and Mister Stone? Who were they?""
The lights of the car illuminated the winter landscape. Wednesday had announced that they were not to take freeways because he didn't know whose side the freeways were on, so Shadow was sticking to back roads. He didn't mind. He wasn't even sure that Wednesday was crazy.
Wednesday grunted. ""Just spooks. Members of the opposition. Black hats.""
""I think,"" said Shadow, ""that they think they're the white hats.""
""Of course they do. There's never been a true war that wasn't fought between two sets of people who were certain they were in the right. The really dangerous people believe that they are doing whatever they are doing solely and only because it is without question the right thing to do. And that is what makes them dangerous.""
""And you?"" asked Shadow. ""Why are you doing what you're doing?""
""Because I want to,"" said Wednesday. And then he grinned. ""So that's all right.""
Shadow said, ""How did you all get away? Or did you all get away?""
""We did,"" said Wednesday. ""Although it was a close thing. If they'd not stopped to grab you, they might have taken the lot of us. It convinced several of the people who had been sitting on the fence that I might not be completely crazy.""
""So how did you get out?""
Wednesday shook his head. ""I don't pay you to ask questions,"" he said. ""I've told you before.""
Shadow shrugged.
They spent the night in a Super 8 motel, south of La Crosse.
Christmas Day was spent on the road, driving north and east. The farmland became pine forest. The towns seemed to come farther and farther apart.
They ate their Christmas lunch late in the afternoon in a hall-like family restaurant in northern central Wisconsin. Shadow picked cheerlessly at the dry turkey, jam-sweet red lumps of cranberry sauce, tough-as-wood roasted potatoes and the violently green canned peas. From the way he attacked it, and the way he smacked his lips, Wednesday seemed to be enjoying the food. As the meal progressed he became positively expansive-talking, joking, and, whenever she came close enough, flirting with the waitress, a thin blonde girl who looked scarcely old enough to have dropped out of high school.
""Excuse me, m'dear, but might I trouble you for another cup of your delightful hot chocolate? And I trust you won't think me too forward if I say what a mightily fetching and becoming dress that is. Festive, yet classy.""
The waitress, who wore a bright red and green skirt edged with glittering silver tinsel, giggled and colored and smiled happily, and went off to get Wednesday another mug of hot chocolate.
""Fetching,"" said Wednesday, thoughtfully, watching her go. ""Becoming,"" he said. Shadow did not think he was talking about the dress. Wednesday shoveled the final slice of turkey into his mouth, flicked at his beard with his napkin, and pushed his plate forward. ""Aaah. Good."" He looked around him, at the family restaurant. In the background a tape of Christmas songs was playing: the little drummer boy had no gifts to bring, parupapom-pom, rapappom pom, rapappom pom.
""Some things may change,"" said Wednesday, abruptly. ""People, however...people stay the same. Some grifts last forever, others are swallowed soon enough by time and by the world. My favorite grift of all is no longer practical. Still, a surprising number of grifts are timeless-the Spanish Prisoner, the Pigeon Drop, the Fawney Rig (that's the Pigeon Drop but with a gold ring instead of a wallet), the Fiddle Game...""
""I've never heard of the Fiddle Game,"" said Shadow. ""I think I've heard of the others. My old cellmate said he'd actually done the Spanish Prisoner. He was a grifter.""
""Ah,"" said Wednesday, and his left eye sparkled. ""The Fiddle Game was a fine and wonderful con. In its purest form it is a two-man grift. It trades on cupidity and greed, as all great grifts do. You can always cheat an honest man, but it takes more work. So. We are in a hotel, or an inn, or a fine restaurant, and, dining there, we find a man-shabby, but shabby genteel, not down-at-heel but certainly down on his luck. We shall call him Abraham. And when the time comes to settle his bill-not a huge bill, you understand, fifty, seventy-five dollars-an embarrassment! Where is his wallet? Good Lord, he must have left it at a friend's, not far away. He shall go and obtain his wallet forthwith! But here, mine host, says Abraham, take this old fiddle of mine for security. It's old, as you can see, but it's how I make my living.""
Wednesday's smile when he saw the waitress approaching was huge and predatory. ""Ah, the hot chocolate! Brought to me by my Christmas Angel! Tell me, my dear, could I have some more of your delicious bread when you get a moment?""
The waitress-what was she, Shadow wondered: sixteen, seventeen?-looked at the floor and her cheeks flushed crimson. She put down the chocolate with shaking hands and retreated to the edge of the room, by the slowly rotating display of pies, where she stopped and stared at Wednesday. Then she slipped into the kitchen, to fetch Wednesday his bread.
""So. The violin-old, unquestionably, perhaps even a little battered-is placed away in its case, and our temporarily impecunious Abraham sets off in search of his wallet. But a well-dressed gentleman, only just done with his own dinner, has been observing this exchange, and now he approaches our host: could he, perchance, inspect the violin that honest Abraham left behind?
""Certainly he can. Our host hands it over, and the well-dressed man-let us call him Barrington-opens his mouth wide, then remembers himself and closes it, examines the violin reverentially, like a man who has been permitted into a holy sanctum to examine the bones of a prophet. 'Why,' he says, 'this is-it must be-no, it cannot be-but yes, there it is-my lord! But this is unbelievable!"" and he points to the maker's mark, on a strip of browning paper inside the violin-but still, he says, even without it he would have known it by the color of the varnish, by the scroll, by the shape.
""Now Barrington reaches inside his pocket and produces an engraved business card, proclaiming him to be a preeminent dealer in rare and antique musical instruments. 'So this violin is rare?' asks mine host. 'Indeed it is,' says Barrington, still admiring it with awe, 'and worth in excess of a hundred thousand dollars, unless I miss my guess. Even as a dealer in such things I would pay fifty-no, seventy-five thousand dollars, good cash money for such an exquisite piece. I have a man on the West Coast who would buy it tomorrow, sight unseen, with one telegram, and pay whatever I asked for it.' And then he consults his watch, and his face falls. 'My train-' he says. 'I have scarcely enough time to catch my train! Good sir, when the owner of this inestimable instrument should return, please give him my card, for, alas, I must be away.' And with that, Barrington leaves, a man who knows that time and the train wait for no man.
""Mine host examines the violin, curiosity mingling with cupidity in his veins, and a plan begins to bubble up through his mind. But the minutes go by, and Abraham does not return. And now it is late, and through the door, shabby but proud, comes our Abraham, our fiddle-player, and he holds in his hands a wallet, a wallet that has seen better days, a wallet that has never contained more than a hundred dollars on its best day, and from it he takes the money to pay for his meal or his stay, and he asks for the return of his violin.
""Mine host puts the fiddle in its case on the counter, and Abraham takes it like a mother cradling her child. 'Tell me,' says the host (with the engraved card of a man who'll pay fifty thousand dollars, good cash money, burning in his inside breast pocket), 'how much is a violin like this worth? For my niece has a yearning on her to play the fiddle, and it's her birthday coming up in a week or so.'
""'Sell this fiddle?' says Abraham. 'I could never sell her. I've had her for twenty years I have, fiddled all over the country with her. And to tell the truth, she cost me all of five hundred dollars back when I bought her.'
""Mine host keeps the smile from his face. 'Five hundred dollars? What if I were to offer you a thousand dollars for it, here and now?'
""The fiddle player looks delighted, then crestfallen, and he says, 'But lordy, I'm a fiddle player, sir, it's all I know how to do. This fiddle knows me and she loves me, and my fingers know her so well I could play an air upon her in the dark. Where will I find another that sounds so fine? A thousand dollars is good money, but this is my livelihood. Not a thousand dollars, not for five thousand.""
""Mine host sees his profits shrinking, but this is business, and you must spend money to make money. 'Eight thousand dollars,' he says. 'It's not worth that, but I've taken a fancy to it, and I do love and indulge my niece.'
""Abraham is almost in tears at the thought of losing his beloved fiddle, but how can he say no to eight thousand dollars?-especially when mine host goes to the wall safe, and removes not eight but nine thousand dollars, all neatly banded and ready to be slipped into the fiddle player's threadbare pocket. 'You're a good man,' he tells his host. 'You're a saint! But you must swear to take care of my girl!' and, reluctantly, he hands over his violin.""
""But what if mine host simply hands over Barrington's card and tells Abraham that he's come into some good fortune?"" asked Shadow.
""Then we're out the cost of two dinners,"" said Wednesday. He wiped the remaining gravy and leftovers from his plate with a slice of bread, which he ate with lip-smacking relish.
""Let me see if I've got it straight,"" said Shadow. ""So Abraham leaves, nine thousand dollars the richer, and in the parking lot by the train station he and Barrington meet up. They split the money, get into Barrington's Model A Ford and head for the next town. I guess in the trunk of that car they must have a box filled with hundred-dollar violins.""
""I personally made it a point of honor never to pay more than five dollars for any of them,"" said Wednesday. Then he turned to the hovering waitress. ""Now, my dear, regale us with your description of the sumptuous desserts available to us on this, our Lord's natal day."" He stared at her-it was almost a leer-as if nothing that she could offer him would be as toothsome a morsel as herself. Shadow felt deeply uncomfortable: it was like watching an old wolf stalking a fawn too young to know that if it did not run, and run now, it would wind up in a distant glade with its bones picked clean by the ravens.
The girl blushed once more and told them that dessert was apple pie, apple pie à la mode-""That's with a scoop of vanilla ice cream""-Christmas Cake, Christmas Cake à la mode, or a red and green whipped pudding. Wednesday stared into her eyes and told her that he would try the Christmas Cake à la mode. Shadow passed.
""Now, as grifts go,"" said Wednesday, ""the Fiddle Game goes back three hundred years or more. And if you pick your chicken correctly you could still play it tomorrow anywhere in America.""
""I thought you said that your favorite grift was no longer practical,"" said Shadow.
""I did indeed. However, that is not my favorite. It was fine and enjoyable, but not my favorite. No, my favorite was one they called the Bishop Game. It had everything: excitement, subterfuge, portability, surprise. Perhaps, I think from time to time, perhaps with a little modification, it might..."" He thought for a moment, then shook his head. ""No. Its time has passed. It is, let us say, 1920, in a city of medium to large size-Chicago, perhaps, or New York, or Philadelphia. We are in a jeweler's emporium. A man dressed as a clergyman-and not just any clergyman, but a bishop, in his purple-enters and picks out a necklace, a gorgeous and glorious confection of diamonds and pearls, and pays for it with a dozen of the crispest hundred-dollar bills.
""There's a smudge of green ink on the topmost bill and the store owner, apologetically but firmly, sends the stack of bills to the bank on the corner to be checked. Soon enough, the store clerk returns with the bills. The bank says they are none of them counterfeit. The owner apologizes again, and the bishop is most gracious, he well understands the problem, there are such lawless and ungodly types in the world today, such immorality and lewdness abroad in the world-and shameless women, and now that the underworld has crawled out of the gutter and come to live on the screens of the picture palaces what more could anyone expect? And the necklace is placed in its case, and the store owner does his best not to ponder why a bishop of the church would be purchasing a twelve-hundred-dollar diamond necklace, nor why he would be paying good cash money for it.
""The bishop bids him a hearty farewell, and walks out on the street, only for a heavy hand to descend on his shoulder. 'Why, Soapy, yez spalpeen, up to your old tricks are you?' and a broad beat cop with an honest Irish face walks the bishop back into the jewelry store.
""'Beggin' your pardon, but has this man just bought anything from you?' asks the cop. 'Certainly not,' says the bishop. 'Tell him I have not.' 'Indeed he has,' says the jeweler. 'He bought a pearl and diamond necklace from me-paid for it in cash as well.' 'Would you have the bills available, sir?' asks the cop.
""So the jeweler takes the twelve hundred-dollar bills from the cash register and hands them to the cop, who holds them up to the light and shakes his head in wonder. 'Oh, Soapy, Soapy,' he says, 'these are the finest that you've made yet! You're a craftsman, that you are!'
""A self-satisfied smile spreads across the bishop's face. 'You can't prove nothing,' says the bishop. 'And the bank said that they were on the level. It's the real green stuff.' 'I'm sure they did,' agrees the cop on the beat, 'but I doubt that the bank had been warned that Soapy Sylvester was in town, nor of the quality of the hundred-dollar bills he'd been passing in Denver and in St. Louis.' And with that he reaches into the bishop's pocket and pulls out the necklace. ""Twelve hundred dollars' worth of diamonds and pearls in exchange for fifty cents' worth of paper and ink,' says the policeman, who is obviously a philosopher at heart. 'And passing yourself off as a man of the church. You should be ashamed,' he says, as he claps the handcuffs on the bishop, who is obviously no bishop, and he marches him away, but not before he gives the jeweler a receipt for both the necklace and the twelve hundred counterfeit dollars. It's evidence, after all.""
""Was it really counterfeit?"" asked Shadow.
""Of course not! Fresh banknotes, straight from the bank, only with a thumbprint and a smudge of green ink on a couple of them to make them a little more interesting.""
Shadow sipped his coffee. It was worse than prison coffee. ""So the cop was obviously no cop. And the necklace?""
""Evidence,"" said Wednesday. He unscrewed the top from the salt-shaker, poured a little heap of salt on the table. ""But the jeweler gets a receipt, and assurance that he'll get the necklace straight back as soon as Soapy comes to trial. He is congratulated on being a good citizen, and he watches, proudly, already thinking of the tale he'll have to tell at the next meeting of the Oddfellows tomorrow night, as the policeman marches the man pretending to be a bishop out of the store, twelve hundred dollars in one pocket, a twelve-hundred-dollar diamond necklace in the other, on their way to a police station that'll never see hide nor hair of either of them.""
The waitress had returned to clear the table. ""Tell me, my dear,"" said Wednesday. ""Are you married?""
She shook her head.
""Astonishing that a young lady of such loveliness has not yet been snapped up."" He was doodling with his fingernail in the spilled salt, making squat, blocky rune-like shapes. The waitress stood passively beside him, reminding Shadow less of a fawn and more of a young rabbit caught in an eighteen-wheeler's headlights, frozen in fear and indecision.
Wednesday lowered his voice, so much so that Shadow, only across the table, could barely hear him. ""What time do you get off work?""
""Nine,"" she said, and swallowed. ""Nine thirty latest.""
""And what is the finest motel in this area?""
""There's a Motel 6,"" she said. ""It's not much.""
Wednesday touched the back of her hand, fleetingly, with the tips of his fingers, leaving crumbs of salt on her skin. She made no attempt to wipe them off. ""To us,"" he said, his voice an almost inaudible rumble, ""it shall be a pleasure-palace.""
The waitress looked at him. She bit her thin lips, hesitated, then nodded and fled for the kitchen.
""C'mon,"" said Shadow. ""She looks barely legal.""
""I've never been overly concerned about legality,"" Wednesday told him. ""Not as long as I get what I want. Sometimes the nights are long and cold. And I need her, not as an end in herself, but to wake me up a little. Even King David knew that there is one easy prescription to get warm blood flowing through an old frame: take one virgin, call me in the morning.""
Shadow caught himself wondering if the girl on night duty in the hotel back in Eagle Point had been a virgin. ""Don't you ever worry about disease?"" he asked. ""What if you knock her up? What if she's got a brother?""
""No,"" said Wednesday. ""I don't worry about diseases. I don't catch them. People like me avoid them. Unfortunately, for the most part people like me fire blanks, so there's not a great deal of interbreeding. It used to happen in the old days. Nowadays, it's possible, but so unlikely as to be almost unimaginable. So no worries there. And many girls have brothers, and fathers. Some even have husbands. It's not my problem. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, I've left town already.""
""So we're staying here for the night?""
Wednesday rubbed his chin. ""I shall stay in the Motel 6,"" he said. Then he put his hand into his coat pocket. He pulled out a front-door key, bronze-colored, with a card tag attached on which was typed an address: 502 NORTHRIDGE RD, APT #3. ""You, on the other hand, have an apartment waiting for you, in a city far from here."" Wednesday closed his eyes for a moment. Then he opened them, gray and gleaming and fractionally mismatched, and he said, ""The Greyhound bus will be coming through town in twenty minutes. It stops at the gas station. Here's your ticket."" He pulled out a folded bus ticket, passed it across the table. Shadow picked it up and looked at it.
""Who's Mike Ainsel?"" he asked. That was the name on the ticket.
""You are. Happy Christmas.""
""And where's Lakeside?""
""Your happy home in the months to come. And now, because good things come in threes..."" He took a small, gift-wrapped package from his pocket, pushed it across the table. It sat beside the ketchup bottle with the black smears of dried ketchup on the top. Shadow made no move to take it.
""Well?""
Reluctantly, Shadow tore open the red wrapping paper, to reveal a fawn-colored calfskin wallet, shiny from use. It was obviously somebody's wallet. Inside the wallet was a driver's license with Shadow's photograph on it, in the name of Michael Ainsel, with a Milwaukee address, a MasterCard for M. Ainsel, and twenty crisp fifty-dollar bills. Shadow closed the wallet, put it into an inside pocket.
""Thanks,"" he said.
""Think of it as a Christmas bonus. Now, let me walk you down to the Greyhound. I shall wave to you as you ride the gray dog north.""
They walked outside the restaurant. Shadow found it hard to believe how much colder it had gotten in the last few hours. It felt too cold to snow, now. Aggressively cold. This was a bad winter.
""Hey. Wednesday. Both of the scams you were telling me about-the violin scam and the bishop one, the bishop and the cop-"" He hesitated, trying to form his thought, to bring it into focus.
""What of them?""
Then he had it. ""They're both two-man scams. One guy on each side. Did you used to have a partner?"" Shadow's breath came in clouds. He promised himself that when he got to Lakeside he would spend some of his Christmas bonus on the warmest, thickest winter coat that money could buy.
""Yes,"" said Wednesday. ""Yes. I had a partner. A junior partner. But, alas, those days are gone. There's the gas station, and there, unless my eye deceives me, is the bus."" It was already signaling its turn into the parking lot. ""Your address is on the key,"" said Wednesday. ""If anyone asks, I am your uncle, and I shall be rejoicing in the unlikely name of Emerson Borson. Settle in, in Lakeside, nephew Ainsel. I'll come for you within the week. We shall be traveling together. Visiting the people I have to visit. In the meantime, keep your head down and stay out of trouble.""
""My car-?"" said Shadow.
""I'll take good care of it. Have a good time in Lakeside,"" said Wednesday. He thrust out his hand, and Shadow shook it. Wednesday's hand was colder than a corpse's.
""Jesus,"" said Shadow. ""You're cold.""
""Then the sooner I am making the two-backed beast with the little hotsy-totsy lass from the restaurant in a back room of the Motel 6, the better."" And he reached out his other hand and squeezed Shadow's shoulder.
Shadow experienced a dizzying moment of double vision: he saw the grizzled man facing him, squeezing his shoulder, but he saw something else: so many winters, hundreds and hundreds of winters, and a gray man in a broad-brimmed hat walking from settlement to settlement, leaning on his staff, staring in through windows at the firelight, at a joy and a burning life he would never be able to touch, never even be able to feel...
""Go,"" said Wednesday, his voice a reassuring growl. ""All is well, and all is well, and all shall be well.""
Shadow showed his ticket to the driver. ""Hell of a day to be traveling,"" she said. And then she added, with a certain grim satisfaction, ""Merry Christmas.""
The bus was almost empty. ""When will we get in to Lakeside?"" asked Shadow.
""Two hours. Maybe a bit more,"" said the driver. ""They say there's a cold snap coming."" She thumbed a switch and the doors closed with a hiss and a thump.
Shadow walked halfway down the bus, put the seat back as far as it would go, and he started to think. The motion of the bus and the warmth combined to lull him, and before he was aware that he was becoming sleepy, he was asleep.
  
In the earth, and under the earth. The marks on the wall were the red of wet clay: hand prints, finger-marks and, here and there, crude representations of animals and people and birds.
The fire still burned and the buffalo man still sat on the other side of the fire, staring at Shadow with huge eyes, eyes like pools of dark mud. The buffalo lips, fringed with matted brown hair, did not move as the buffalo voice said, ""Well, Shadow? Do you believe yet?""
""I don't know,"" said Shadow. His mouth had not moved either, he observed. Whatever words were passing between the two of them were not being spoken, not in any way that Shadow understood speech. ""Are you real?""
""Believe,"" said the buffalo man.
""Are you..."" Shadow hesitated, and then he asked, ""Are you a god too?""
The buffalo man reached one hand into the flames of the fire and he pulled out a burning brand. He held the brand in the middle. Blue and yellow flames licked his red hand, but they did not burn.
""This is not a land for gods,"" said the buffalo man. But it was not the buffalo man talking any more, Shadow knew, in his dream: it was the fire speaking, the crackling and the burning of the flame itself that spoke to Shadow in the dark place under the earth.
""This land was brought up from the depths of the ocean by a diver,"" said the fire. ""It was spun from its own substance by a spider. It was shat by a raven. It is the body of a fallen father, whose bones are mountains, whose eyes are lakes.
""This is a land of dreams and fire,"" said the flame.
The buffalo man put the brand back on the fire.
""Why are you telling me this stuff?"" said Shadow. ""I'm not important. I'm not anything. I was an okay physical trainer, a really lousy smalltime crook and maybe not so good a husband as I thought I was..."" He trailed off.
""How do I help Laura?"" Shadow asked the buffalo man. ""She wants to be alive again. I said I'd help her. I owe her that.""
The buffalo man said nothing. He pointed up with his soot-blackened palm facing Shadow, his index finger pointing toward the roof of the cave. Shadow's eyes followed. There was a thin, wintry light, coming from a tiny opening far above.
""Up there?"" asked Shadow, wishing that one of his questions would be answered. ""I'm supposed to go up there?""
The dream took him then, the idea becoming the thing itself, and Shadow was crushed into the rock and earth. He was like a mole, trying to push through the earth, like a badger, climbing through the earth, like a groundhog, pushing the earth out of his way, like a bear, but the earth was too hard, too dense, and his breath was coming in gasps, and soon he could go no further, dig and climb no more, and he knew then that he would die, somewhere in the deep place beneath the world.
His own strength was not enough. His efforts became weaker. He knew that though his body was riding in a hot bus through cold woods if he stopped breathing here, beneath the world, he would stop breathing there as well, that even now his breath was coming in shallow panting gasps.
He struggled and he pushed, ever more weakly, each movement using precious air. He was trapped: could go no further, and could not return the way that he had come.
""Now bargain,"" said a voice in his mind. It might have been his own voice. He could not tell.
""What do I have to bargain with?"" Shadow asked. ""I have nothing.""
He could taste the clay now, thick and mud-gritty in his mouth; he could taste the sharp mineral tang of the rocks that surrounded him.
And then Shadow said, ""Except myself. I have myself, don't I?""
It seemed as if everything was holding its breath-not just Shadow, but the whole world under the earth, every worm, every crevice, every cavern, holding its breath.
""I offer myself,"" he said.
The response was immediate. The rocks and the earth that had surrounded him began to push down on Shadow, squeezed him so hard that the last ounce of air in his lungs was crushed out of him. The pressure became pain, pushing him on every side, and he felt he was being mashed, a fern becoming coal. He reached the zenith of pain and hung there, cresting, knowing that he could take no more, that no one could take more than this, and at that moment the spasm eased and Shadow could breathe again. The light above him had grown larger.
He was being pushed toward the surface.
As the next earth-spasm hit, Shadow tried to ride with it. This time he felt himself being pushed upward, the pressure of the earth pushing him out, expelling him, pushing him closer to the light. And then a moment for a breath.
The spasms took him and rocked him, each harder, each more painful than the one before it.
He rolled and writhed through the earth, and now his face was pushed against the opening, a gap in the rock scarcely larger than the span of his hand, through which a muted gray light came, and air, blessed air.
The pain, on that last awful contraction, was impossible to believe as he felt himself being squeezed, crushed and pushed through that unyielding rock gap, his bones shattering, his flesh becoming something shapeless and snakelike, and as his mouth and ruined head cleared the hole he began to scream, in fear and pain.
He wondered, as he screamed, whether, back in the waking world, he was also screaming-if he were screaming in his sleep back on the darkened bus.
And as that final spasm ended Shadow was on the ground, his fingers clutching the red earth, grateful only that the pain was over and he could breathe once more, deep lungfuls of warm, evening air.
He pulled himself into a sitting position, wiped the earth from his face with his hand and looked up at the sky. It was twilight, a long, purple twilight, and the stars were coming out, one by one, stars so much brighter and more vivid than any stars he had ever seen or imagined.
""Soon,"" said the crackling voice of the flame, coming from behind him, ""they will fall. Soon they will fall and the star people will meet the earth people. There will be heroes among them, and men who will slay monsters and bring knowledge, but none of them will be gods. This is a poor place for gods.""
A blast of air, shocking in its coldness, touched his face. It was like being doused in ice water. He could hear the driver's voice saying that they were in Pinewood, anyone who needs a cigarette or wants to stretch their legs, we'll be stopping here for ten minutes then we'll be back on the road.
Shadow stumbled off the bus. They were parked outside another rural gas station, almost identical to the one they had left. The driver was helping a couple of teenage girls onto the bus, putting their suitcases away in the luggage compartment.
""Hey,"" the driver said, when she saw Shadow. ""You're getting off at Lakeside, right?""
Shadow agreed, sleepily, that he was.
""Heck, that's a good town,"" said the bus-driver. ""I think sometimes that if I were just going to pack it all in, I'd move to Lakeside. Prettiest town I've ever seen. You've lived there long?""
""My first visit.""
""You have a pasty at Mabel's for me, you hear?""
Shadow decided not to ask for clarification. ""Tell me,"" said Shadow, ""was I talking in my sleep?""
""If you were, I didn't hear you."" She looked at her watch. ""Back on the bus. I'll call you when we get to Lakeside.""
The two girls-he doubted that either of them was much more than fourteen years old-who had got on in Pinewood were now in the seat in front of him. They were friends, Shadow decided, eavesdropping without meaning to, not sisters. One of them knew almost nothing about sex, but knew a lot about animals, helped out or spent a lot of time at some kind of animal shelter, while the other was not interested in animals, but, armed with a hundred tidbits gleaned from the Internet and from daytime television, thought she knew a great deal about human sexuality. Shadow listened with a horrified and amused fascination to the one who thought she was wise in the ways of the world detail the precise mechanics of using Alka-Seltzer tablets to enhance oral sex.
He listened to both of them-the girl who liked animals, and the one who knew why Alka-Seltzer gave you more oral bang for your buck than, like, even Altoids-dishing the dirt on the current Miss Lakeside, who had, like, everybody knew, only gotten her greasy hands on the coronet and sash by flirtin' up to the judges.
Shadow started to tune them out, blanked everything except the noise of the road, and now only fragments of conversation would come back every now and again.
Goldie is, like, such a good dog, and he was a purebred retriever, if only my dad would say okay, he wags his tail whenever he sees me.
It's Christmas, he has to let me use the snowmobile.
You can write your name with your tongue on the side of his thing.
I miss Sandy.
Yeah, I miss Sandy too.
Six inches tonight they said, but they just make it up, they make up the weather and nobody ever calls them on it...
And then the brakes of the bus were hissing and the driver was shouting ""Lakeside!"" and the doors clunked open. Shadow followed the girls out into the floodlit parking lot of a video store and tanning salon that functioned, Shadow guessed, as Lakeside's Greyhound station. The air was dreadfully cold, but it was a fresh cold. It woke him up. He stared at the lights of the town to the south and the west, and the pale expanse of a frozen lake to the east.
The girls were standing in the lot, stamping and blowing on their hands dramatically. One of them, the younger one, snuck a look at Shadow, smiled awkwardly when she realized that he had seen her do so.
""Merry Christmas,"" said Shadow. It seemed like a safe thing to say.
""Yeah,"" said the other girl, perhaps a year or so older than the first, ""merry Christmas to you too."" She had carroty red hair and a snub nose covered with a hundred thousand freckles.
""Nice town you got here,"" said Shadow.
""We like it,"" said the younger one. She was the one who liked animals. She gave Shadow a shy grin, revealing blue rubber-band braces stretching across her front teeth. ""You look like somebody,"" she told him, gravely. ""Are you somebody's brother or somebody's son or something?""
""You are such a spaz, Alison,"" said her friend. ""Everybody's somebody's son or brother or something.""
""That wasn't what I meant,"" said Alison. Headlights framed them all for one brilliant white moment. Behind the headlights was a station wagon with a mother in it, and in moments it took the girls and their bags away, leaving Shadow standing alone in the parking lot.
""Young man? Anything I can do for you?"" The old man was locking up the video store. He pocketed his keys. ""Store ain't open Christmas,"" he told Shadow cheerfully. ""But I come down to meet the bus. Make sure everything was okay. Couldn't live with myself if some poor soul'd found 'emselves stranded on Christmas Day."" He was close enough that Shadow could see his face: old but contented, the face of a man who had sipped life's vinegar and found it, by and large, to be mostly whiskey, and good whiskey at that.
""Well, you could give me the number of the local taxi company,"" said Shadow.
""I could,"" said the old man, doubtfully, ""but Tom'll be in his bed this time of night, and even if you could rouse him you'll get no satisfaction-I saw him down at the Buck Stops Here earlier this evening, and he was very merry. Very merry indeed. Where is it you're aiming to go?""
Shadow showed him the address tag on the door key.
""Well,"" he said, ""that's a ten-, mebbe a twenty-minute walk over the bridge and around. But it's no fun when it's this cold, and when you don't know where you're going it always seems longer-you ever notice that? First time takes forever, and then ever after it's over in a flash?""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""I've never thought of it like that. But I guess it's true.""
The old man nodded. His face cracked into a grin. ""What the heck, it's Christmas. I'll run you over there in Tessie.""
""Tessie?"" said Shadow, and then he said, ""I mean, thank you.""
""You're welcome.""
Shadow followed the old man to the road, where a huge old roadster was parked. It looked like something that gangsters might have been proud to drive in the Roaring Twenties, running boards and all. It was a deep dark color under the sodium lights that might have been red and might have been green. ""This is Tessie,"" the old man said. ""Ain't she a beaut?"" He patted her proprietarily, where the hood curved up and arched over the front nearside wheel.
""What make is she?"" asked Shadow.
""She's a Wendt Phoenix. Wendt went under in '31, name was bought by Chrysler, but they never made any more Wendts. Harvey Wendt, who founded the company, was a local boy. Went out to California, killed himself in, oh, 1941, '42. Great tragedy.""
The car smelled of leather and old cigarette smoke-not a fresh smell, but as if enough people had smoked enough cigarettes and cigars in the car over the years that the smell of burning tobacco had become part of the fabric of the car. The old man turned the key in the ignition and Tessie started first time.
""Tomorrow,"" he told Shadow, ""she goes into the garage. I'll cover her with a dust sheet, and that's where she'll stay until spring. Truth of the matter is, I shouldn't be driving her right now, with the snow on the ground.""
""Doesn't she ride well in snow?""
""Rides just fine. It's the salt they put on the roads to melt the snow. Rusts these old beauties faster than you could believe. You want to go door to door, or would you like the moonlight grand tour of the town?""
""I don't want to trouble you-""
""It's no trouble. You get to be my age, you're grateful for the least wink of sleep. I'm lucky if I get five hours a night nowadays-wake up and my mind is just turning and turning. Where are my manners? My name's Hinzelmann. I'd say, call me Richie, but round here folks who know me just call me plain Hinzelmann. I'd shake your hand, but I need two hands to drive Tessie. She knows when I'm not paying attention.""
""Mike Ainsel,"" said Shadow. ""Pleased to meet you, Hinzelmann.""
""So we'll go round the lake. Grand tour,"" said Hinzelmann.
Main Street, which they were on, was a pretty street, even at night, and it looked old-fashioned in the best sense of the word-as if, for a hundred years, people had been caring for that street and they had not been in a hurry to lose anything they liked.
Hinzelmann pointed out the town's two restaurants as they passed them (a German restaurant and what he described as ""Greek, Norwegian, bit of everything, and a popover at every plate""); he pointed out the bakery and the bookstore (""What I say is, a town isn't a town without a bookstore. It may call itself a town, but unless it's got a bookstore, it knows it's not foolin' a soul""). He slowed Tessie as they passed the library so Shadow could get a good look at it. Antique gaslights flickered over the doorway-Hinzelmann proudly called Shadow's attention to them. ""Built in the 1870s by John Henning, local lumber baron. He wanted it called the Henning Memorial Library, but when he died they started calling it the Lakeside Library, and I guess it'll be the Lakeside Library now until the end of time. Isn't it a dream?"" He couldn't have been prouder of it if he had built it himself. The building reminded Shadow of a castle, and he said so. ""That's right,"" agreed Hinzelmann. ""Turrets and all. Henning wanted it to look like that on the outside. Inside they still have all the original pine shelving. Miriam Shultz wants to tear the insides out and modernize, but it's on the register of historic places, and there's not a damn thing she can do.""
They drove around the south side of the lake. The town circled the lake, which was a thirty-foot drop below the level of the road. Shadow could see the patches of white ice dulling the surface of the lake with, here and there, a shiny patch of water reflecting the lights of the town.
""Looks like it's freezing over,"" he said.
""It's been frozen over for a month now,"" said Hinzelmann. ""The dull spots are snowdrifts and the shiny spots are ice. It froze just after Thanksgiving in one cold night, froze smooth as glass. You do much ice-fishing, Mr. Ainsel?""
""Never.""
""Best thing a man can do. It's not the fish you catch, it's the peace of mind that you take home at the end of the day.""
""I'll remember that."" Shadow peered down at the lake through Tessie's window. ""Can you actually walk on it already?""
""You can walk on it. Drive on it too, but I wouldn't want to risk it yet. It's been cold up here for six weeks,"" said Hinzelmann. ""But you also got to allow that things freeze harder and faster up here in northern Wisconsin than they do most anyplace else there is. I was out hunting once-hunting for deer, and this was oh, thirty, forty years back, and I shot at a buck, missed him and sent him running off through the woods-this was over acrost the north end of the lake, up near where you'll be living, Mike. Now he was the finest buck I ever did see, twenty point, big as a small horse, no lie. Now, I'm younger and feistier back then than I am now, and though it had started snowing before Halloween that year, now it was Thanksgiving and there was clean snow on the ground, fresh as anything, and I could see the buck's footprints. It looked to me like the big fellow was heading for the lake in a panic.
""Well, only a damn fool tries to run down a buck, but there am I, a damn fool, running after him, and there he is, standing in the lake, in oh, eight, nine inches of water, and he's just looking at me. That very moment, the sun goes behind a cloud, and the freeze comes-temperature must have fallen thirty degrees in ten minutes, not a word of a lie. And that old stag, he gets ready to run, and he can't move. He's frozen into the ice.
""Me, I just walk over to him slowly. You can see he wants to run, but he's iced in and it just isn't going to happen. But there's no way I can bring myself to shoot a defenseless critter when he can't get away-what kind of man would I be if I done that, heh? So I takes my shotgun and I fires off one shell, straight up into the air.
""Well the noise and the shock is enough to make that buck just about jump out of his skin, and seein' that his legs are iced in, that's just what he proceeds to do. He leaves his hide and his antlers stuck to the ice, while he charges back into the woods, pink as a newborn mouse and shivering fit to bust.
""I felt bad enough for that old buck that I talked the Lakeside Ladies Knitting Circle into making him something warm to wear all the winter, and they knitted him an all-over one-piece woolen suit, so he wouldn't freeze to death. Course the joke was on us, because they knitted him a suit of bright orange wool so no hunter ever shot at it. Hunters in these parts wear orange at hunting season,"" he added, helpfully. ""And if you think there's a word of a lie in that, I can prove it to you. I've got the antlers up on my rec room wall to this day.""
Shadow laughed, and the old man smiled the satisfied smile of a master craftsman. They pulled up outside a brick building with a large wooden deck, from which golden holiday lights hung and twinkled invitingly.
""That's Five-oh-two,"" said Hinzelmann. ""Apartment three would be on the top floor, round the other side, overlooking the lake. There you go, Mike.""
""Thank you, Mr. Hinzelmann. Can I give you anything toward gas?""
""Just Hinzelmann. And you don't owe me a penny. Merry Christmas from me and from Tessie.""
""Are you sure you won't accept anything?""
The old man scratched his chin. ""Tell you what,"" he said. ""Sometime in the next week or so I'll come by and sell you some tickets. For our raffle. Charity. For now, young man, you can be getting on to bed.""
Shadow smiled. ""Merry Christmas, Hinzelmann,"" he said.
The old man shook Shadow's hand with one red-knuckled hand. It felt as hard and as callused as an oak branch. ""Now, you watch the path as you go up there, it's going to be slippery. I can see your door from here, at the side there, see it? I'll just wait in the car down here until you're safely inside. You just give me the thumbs-up when you're in okay, and I'll drive off.""
He kept the Wendt idling until Shadow was safely up the wooden steps on the side of the house, and had opened the apartment door with his key. The door to the apartment swung open. Shadow made a thumbs-up sign and the old man in the Wendt-Tessie, thought Shadow, and the thought of a car with a name made him smile one more time-Hinzelmann and Tessie swung around and made their way back across the bridge.
Shadow shut the front door. The room was freezing. It smelled of people who had gone away to live other lives, and of all they had eaten and dreamed. He found the thermostat and cranked it up to 70 degrees. He went into the tiny kitchen, checked the drawers, opened the avocado-colored refrigerator, but it was empty. No surprise there. At least the fridge smelled clean inside, not musty.
There was a small bedroom with a bare mattress in it, beside the kitchen, next to an even tinier bathroom that was mostly shower stall. An aged cigarette butt floated in the toilet bowl, staining the water brown. Shadow flushed it away.
He found sheets and blankets in a closet, and made the bed. Then he took off his shoes, his jacket and his watch, and he climbed into the bed fully dressed, wondering how long it would take him to get warm.
The lights were off, and there was silence, mostly, nothing but the hum of the refrigerator, and somewhere in the building, a radio playing. He lay there in the darkness, wondering if he had slept himself out on the Greyhound, if the hunger and the cold and the new bed and the craziness of the last few weeks would combine to keep him awake that night.
In the stillness he heard something snap like a shot. A branch, he thought, or the ice. It was freezing out there.
He wondered how long he would have to wait until Wednesday came for him. A day? A week? However long he had, he knew he had to focus on something in the meantime. He would start to work out again, he decided, and practice his coin sleights and palms until he was smooth as anything (Practice all your tricks, somebody whispered inside his head, in a voice that was not his own, all of them but one, not the trick that poor dead Mad Sweeney showed you, dead of exposure and the cold and of being forgotten and surplus to requirements, not that trick. Oh not that one).
But this was a good town. He could feel it.
He thought of his dream, if it had been a dream, that first night in Cairo. He thought of Zorya...what the hell was her name? The midnight sister. And then he thought of Laura...
It was as if thinking of her opened a window in his mind. He could see her. He could, somehow, see her.
She was in Eagle Point, in the backyard outside her mother's big house.
She stood in the cold, which she did not feel any more, or which she felt all the time, she stood outside the house that her mother had bought in 1989 with the insurance money after Laura's father, Harvey McCabe, had passed on, a heart attack while straining on the can, and she was staring in, her cold hands pressed against the glass, her breath not fogging it, not at all, watching her mother, and her sister and her sister's children and husband in from Texas, home for Christmas. Out in the darkness, that was where Laura was, unable not to look.
Tears prickled in Shadow's eyes, and he rolled over in his bed.
Wednesday, he thought, and with just a thought a window opened and he was watching from a corner of the room in the Motel 6, watching two figures thrusting and rolling in the semi-darkness.
He felt like a Peeping Tom, turned his thoughts away, willed them to come back to him. He could imagine huge black wings pounding through the night toward him, he could see the lake spread out below him as the wind blew down from the Arctic, breathed its cold on the land, forcing any remaining liquids to become solid, prying jack-frost fingers a hundred times colder than the fingers of any corpse.
Shadow's breath came shallowly now, and he was no longer cold. He could hear a wind rising, a bitter screaming around the house, and for a moment he thought he could hear words on the wind.
If he was going to be anywhere, he might as well be here, he thought, and then he slept.

Meanwhile. A Conversation. 
Dingdong.
""Miz Crow?""
""Yes.""
""You are Samantha Black Crow?""
""Yes.""
""Do you mind if we ask you a few questions, ma'am?""
""Yeah. I do, actually.""
""There's no need to take that attitude, ma'am.""
""Are you cops? What are you?""
""My name is Town. My colleague here is Mister Road. We're investigating the disappearance of two of our associates.""
""What were their names?""
""I'm sorry?""
""Tell me their names. I want to know what they were called. Your associates. Tell me their names and maybe I'll help you.""
""...Okay. Their names were Mister Stone, and Mister Wood. Now, can we ask you some questions?""
""Do you guys just see things and pick names? 'Oh, you be Mister Sidewalk, he's Mister Carpet, say hello to Mister Airplane'?""
""Very funny, young lady. First question: we need to know if you've seen this man. Here. You can hold the photograph.""
""Whoa. Straight on and profile, with numbers on the bottom...and big. He's cute, though. What did he do?""
""He was mixed up in a small-town bank robbery, as a driver, some years ago. His two colleagues decided to keep all the loot for themselves and ran out on him. He got angry. Found them. Came close to killing them with his hands. The state cut a deal with the men he hurt: they testified and got a suspended sentence, Shadow here got six years. He served three. You ask me, guys like that, they should just lock them up and throw away the key.""
""I've never heard anyone say that in real life, you know. Not out loud.""
""Say what, Miz Crow?""
""Loot. It's not a word you ever hear people say. Maybe in movies people say it. Not for real.""
""This isn't a movie, Miz Crow.""
""Black Crow. It's Miz Black Crow. My friends call me Sam.""
""Got it, Sam. Now about this man-""
""But you aren't my friends. You can call me Miz Black Crow.""
""Listen, you snot-nosed little-""
""It's okay, Mister Road. Sam here-pardon, ma'am,-I mean, Miz Black Crow wants to help us. She's a law-abiding citizen.""
""Ma'am, we know you helped Shadow. You were seen with him, in a white Chevy Nova. He gave you a ride. He bought you dinner. Did he say anything that could help us in our investigation? Two of our best men have vanished.""
""I never met him.""
""You met him. Please don't make the mistake of thinking we're stupid. We aren't stupid.""
""Mm. I meet a lot of people. Maybe I met him and forgot already.""
""Ma'am, it really is to your advantage to cooperate with us.""
""Otherwise, you'll have to introduce me to your friends Mister Thumbscrews and Mister Pentothal?""
""Ma'am, you aren't making this any easier on yourself.""
""Gee. I'm sorry. Now, is there anything else? Cos I'm going to say 'buh-bye now' and close the door and I figure you two are going to go and get into Mister Car and drive away.""
""Your lack of cooperation has been noted, ma'am.""
""Buh-bye now.""

AG_ch9	AG	American Gods	9	2005	10917	CHAPTER NINETEEN 

One describes a tale best by telling the tale. You see? The way one describes a story, to oneself or to the world, is by telling the story. It is a balancing act and it is a dream. The more accurate the map, the more it resembles the territory. The most accurate map possible would be the territory, and thus would be perfectly accurate and perfectly useless. The tale is the map which is the territory. You must remember this.
-FROM THE NOTEBOOKS OF MR. IBIS 
The two of them were driving the VW bus down to Florida on I-75. They'd been driving since dawn, or rather, Shadow had driven, and Mr. Nancy had sat up front in the passenger seat and, from time to time, and with a pained expression on his face, offered to drive. Shadow always said no.
""Are you happy?"" asked Mr. Nancy, suddenly. He had been staring at Shadow for several hours. Whenever Shadow glanced over to his right, Mr. Nancy was looking at him with his earth-brown eyes.
""Not really,"" said Shadow. ""But I'm not dead yet.""
""Huh?""
""Call no man happy until he is dead. Herodotus.""
Mr. Nancy raised a white eyebrow, and he said, ""I'm not dead yet, and, mostly because I'm not dead yet, I'm happy as a clamboy.""
""The Herodotus thing. It doesn't mean that the dead are happy,"" said Shadow. ""It means that you can't judge the shape of someone's life until it's over and done.""
""I don't even judge then,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""And as for happiness, there's a lot of different kinds of happiness, just as there's a hell of a lot of different kinds of dead. Me, I'll just take what I can get when I can get it.""
Shadow changed the subject. ""Those helicopters,"" he said. ""The ones that took away the bodies, and the injured.""
""What about them?""
""Who sent them? Where did they come from?""
""You shouldn't worry yourself about that. They're like valkyries or buzzards. They come because they have to come.""
""If you say so.""
""The dead and the wounded will be taken care of. You ask me, old Jacquel's going to be very busy for the next month or so. Tell me somethin', Shadow-boy.""
""Okay.""
""You learn anythin' from all this?""
Shadow shrugged. ""I don't know. Most of what I learned on the tree I've already forgotten,"" he said. ""I think I met some people. But I'm not certain of anything any more. It's like one of those dreams that changes you. You keep some of the dream forever, and you know things down deep inside yourself, because it happened to you, but when you go looking for details they kind of just slip out of your head.""
""Yeah,"" said Mr. Nancy. And then he said, grudgingly, ""You're not so dumb.""
""Maybe not,"" said Shadow. ""But I wish I could have kept more of what passed through my hands, since I got out of prison. I was given so many things, and I lost them again.""
""Maybe,"" said Mr. Nancy, ""you kept more than you think.""
""No,"" said Shadow.
They crossed the border into Florida, and Shadow saw his first palm tree. He wondered if they'd planted it there on purpose, at the border, just so that you knew you were in Florida now.
Mr. Nancy began to snore, and Shadow glanced over at him. The old man still looked very gray, and his breath was rasping. Shadow wondered, not for the first time, if he had sustained some kind of chest or lung injury in the fight. Nancy had refused any medical attention.
Florida went on for longer than Shadow had imagined, and it was late by the time he pulled up outside a small, one-story wooden house, its windows tightly shuttered, on the outskirts of Fort Pierce. Nancy, who had directed him through the last five miles, invited him to stay the night.
""I can get a room in a motel,"" said Shadow. ""It's not a problem.""
""You could do that, and I'd be hurt. Obviously I wouldn't say anythin'. But I'd be real hurt, real bad,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""So you better stay here, and I'll make you a bed up on the couch.""
Mr. Nancy unlocked the hurricane shutters, and pulled open the windows. The house smelled musty and damp, and a little sweet, as if it were haunted by the ghosts of long-dead cookies.
Shadow agreed, reluctantly, to stay the night there, just as he agreed, even more reluctantly, to walk with Mr. Nancy to the bar at the end of the road, for just one late-night drink while the house aired out.
""Did you see Czernobog?"" asked Nancy, as they strolled through the muggy Floridian night. The air was alive with whirring palmetto bugs and the ground crawled with creatures that scuttled and clicked. Mr. Nancy lit a cigarillo, and coughed and choked on it. Still, he kept right on smoking.
""He was gone when I came out of the cave.""
""He will have headed home. He'll be waitin' for you there, you know.""
""Yes.""
They walked in silence to the end of the road. It wasn't much of a bar, but it was open.
""I'll buy the first beers,"" said Mr. Nancy.
""We're only having one beer, remember,"" said Shadow.
""What are you?"" asked Mr. Nancy. ""Some kind of cheapskate?""
Mr. Nancy bought them their first beers, and Shadow bought the second round. He stared in horror as Mr. Nancy talked the barman into turning on the karaoke machine, and then watched in fascinated embarrassment as the old man belted his way through ""What's New Pussycat?"" before crooning out a moving, tuneful version of ""The Way You Look Tonight."" He had a fine voice, and by the end the handful of people still in the bar were cheering and applauding him.
When he came back to Shadow at the bar he was looking brighter. The whites of his eyes were clear, and the gray pallor that had touched his skin was gone. ""Your turn,"" he said.
""Absolutely not,"" said Shadow.
But Mr. Nancy had ordered more beers and was handing Shadow a stained printout of songs from which to choose. ""Just pick a song you know the words to.""
""This is not funny,"" said Shadow. The world was beginning to swim, a little, but he couldn't muster the energy to argue, and then Mr. Nancy was putting on the backing tape to ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,"" and pushing-literally pushing-Shadow up onto the tiny makeshift stage at the end of the bar.
Shadow held the mike as if it was probably live, and then the backing music started and he croaked out the initial ""Baby..."" Nobody in the bar threw anything in his direction. And it felt good. ""Can you understand me now?"" His voice was rough but melodic, and rough suited the song just fine. ""Sometimes I feel a little mad. Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel...""
And he was still singing it as they walked home through the busy Florida night, the old man and the young, stumbling and happy.
""I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,"" he sang to the crabs and the spiders and the palmetto beetles and the lizards and the night. ""Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.""
Mr. Nancy showed him to the couch. It was much smaller than Shadow, who decided to sleep on the floor, but by the time he had finished deciding to sleep on the floor he was already fast asleep, half-sitting, half-lying, on the tiny sofa.
At first, he did not dream. There was just the comforting darkness. And then he saw a fire burning in the darkness and he walked toward it.
""You did well,"" whispered the buffalo man without moving his lips.
""I don't know what I did,"" said Shadow.
""You made peace,"" said the buffalo man. ""You took our words and made them your own. They never understood that they were here-and the people who worshiped them were here-because it suits us that they are here. But we can change our minds. And perhaps we will.""
""Are you a god?"" asked Shadow.
The buffalo-headed man shook his head. Shadow thought, for a moment, that the creature was amused. ""I am the land,"" he said.
And if there was more to that dream then Shadow did not remember it.
He heard something sizzling. His head was aching, and there was a pounding behind his eyes.
Mr. Nancy was already cooking breakfast: a pile of pancakes, sizzling bacon, perfect eggs, and coffee. He looked in the peak of health.
""My head hurts,"" said Shadow.
""You get a good breakfast inside you, you'll feel like a new man.""
""I'd rather feel like the same man, just with a different head,"" said Shadow.
""Eat,"" said Mr. Nancy.
Shadow ate.
""How do you feel now?""
""Like I've got a headache, only now I've got some food in my stomach and I think I'm going to throw up.""
""Come with me."" Beside the sofa, on which Shadow had spent the night, covered with an African blanket, was a trunk, made of some dark wood, which looked like an undersized pirate chest. Mr. Nancy undid the padlock, and opened the lid. Inside the trunk there were a number of boxes. Nancy rummaged among the boxes. ""It's an ancient African herbal remedy,"" he said. ""It's made of ground willow bark, things like that.""
""Like aspirin?""
""Yup,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""Just like that."" From the bottom of the trunk he produced a giant economy-sized bottle of generic aspirin. He unscrewed the top, and shook out a couple of white pills. ""Here.""
""Nice trunk,"" said Shadow. He took the bitter pills, swallowed them with a glass of water.
""My son sent it to me,"" said Mr. Nancy. ""He's a good boy. I don't see him as much as I'd like.""
""I miss Wednesday,"" said Shadow. ""Despite everything he did. I keep expecting to see him. But I look up and he's not there."" He kept staring at the pirate trunk, trying figure out what it reminded him of.
You will lose many things. Do not lose this. Who said that?
""You miss him? After what he put you through? Put us all through?""
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""I guess I do. Do you think he'll be back?""
""I think,"" said Mr. Nancy, ""that wherever two men are gathered together to sell a third man a twenty-dollar violin for ten thousand dollars, he will be there in spirit.""
""Yes, but-""
""We should get back into the kitchen,"" said Mr. Nancy, his expression becoming stony. ""Those pans won't wash themselves.""
Mr. Nancy washed the pans and the dishes. Shadow dried them, and put them away. Somewhere in there the headache began to ease. They went back into the sitting room.
Shadow stared at the old trunk some more, willing himself to remember. ""If I don't go to see Czernobog,"" he said, ""what would happen?""
""You'll see him,"" said Mr. Nancy flatly. ""Maybe he'll find you. Or maybe he'll bring you to him. But one way or another, you'll see him.""
Shadow nodded. Something started to fall into place. ""Hey,"" he said. ""Is there a god with an elephant's head?""
""Ganesh? He's a Hindu god. He removes obstacles and makes journeys easier. Good cook, too.""
Shadow looked up. ""...it's in the trunk,"" he said. ""I knew it was important, but I didn't know why. I thought maybe it meant the trunk of the tree. But he wasn't talking about that at all, was he?""
Mr. Nancy frowned. ""You lost me.""
""It's in the trunk,"" said Shadow. He knew it was true. He did not know why it should be true, not quite. But of that he was completely certain.
He got to his feet. ""I got to go,"" he said. ""I'm sorry.""
Mr. Nancy raised an eyebrow. ""Why the hurry?""
""Because,"" said Shadow, ""the ice is melting.""

I'll tell you all my secrets
But I lie about my past
So send me off to bed for evermore
-TOM WAITS, ""TANGO TILL THEY'RE SORE"" 
A
whole life in darkness, surrounded by filth, that was what Shadow dreamed, his first night in Lakeside. A child's life, long ago and far away, in a land across the ocean, in the lands where the sun rose. But this life contained no sunrises, only dimness by day and blindness by night.
Nobody spoke to him. He heard human voices, from outside, but he could understand human speech no better than he understood the howling of the owls or the yelps of dogs. He remembered, or thought he remembered, one night, half a lifetime ago, when one of the big people had entered, quietly, and had not cuffed him or fed him, but had picked him up to her breast and embraced him. She smelled good. She had made crooning noises. Hot drops of water had fallen from her face to his. He had been scared, and had wailed loudly in his fear.
She put him down on the straw, hurriedly, and left the hut, fastening the door behind her.
He remembered that moment, and he treasured it, just as he remembered the sweetness of a cabbage-heart, the tart taste of plums, the crunch of apples, the greasy delight of roasted fish.
And now he saw the faces in the firelight, all of them looking at him as he was led out from the hut for the first time, which was the only time. So that was what people looked like. Raised in darkness, he had never seen faces. Everything was so new. So strange. The bonfire light hurt his eyes. They pulled on the rope around his neck, to lead him to the space between the two bonfires, where the man waited for him.
And when the first blade was raised in the firelight, what a cheer went up from the crowd and the child from the darkness began to laugh and laugh with them, in delight and in freedom.
And then the blade came down.
Shadow opened his eyes and realized that he was hungry and cold, in an apartment with a layer of ice clouding the inside of the window glass. His frozen breath, he thought. He got out of bed, pleased he did not have to get dressed. He scraped at a window with a fingernail as he passed, felt the ice collect under the nail, then melt to water.
He tried to remember his dream, but remembered nothing but misery and darkness.
He put on his shoes. He figured he would walk into the town center, walk across the bridge across the northern end of the lake, if he had the geography of the town right. He put on his thin jacket, remembering his promise to himself that he would buy a warm winter coat, opened the apartment door and stepped out onto the wooden deck. The cold took his breath away: he breathed in, and felt every hair in his nostrils freeze into rigidity. The deck gave him a fine view of the lake, irregular patches of gray surrounded by an expanse of white.
He wondered how cold it was. The cold snap had come, that was for sure. It could not be much above zero, and it would not be a pleasant walk, but he was certain he could make it into town without too much trouble. What did Hinzelmann say last night-a ten-minute walk? And Shadow was a big man. He would walk briskly and keep himself warm.
He set off south, heading for the bridge.
Soon he began to cough, a dry, thin cough, as the bitterly cold air touched his lungs. Soon his ears and face and lips hurt, and then his feet hurt. He thrust his ungloved hands deep into his coat pockets, clenched his fingers together trying to find some warmth. He found himself remembering Low Key Lyesmith's tall tales of the Minnesota winters-particularly the one about a hunter treed by a bear during a hard freeze who took out his dick and pissed an arching yellow stream of steaming urine that was already frozen hard before it hit the ground, then slid down the rock-hard frozen-piss-pole to freedom. A wry smile at the memory and another dry, painful cough.
Step after step after step. He glanced back. The apartment building was not as far away as he had expected.
This walk, he decided, was a mistake. But he was already three or four minutes from the apartment, and the bridge over the lake was in sight. It made as much sense to press on as to go home (and then what? Call a taxi on the dead phone? Wait for spring? He had no food in the apartment, he reminded himself).
He kept walking, revising his estimates of the temperature downward as he walked. Minus 10? Minus 20? Minus 40, maybe, that strange point on the thermometer when Celsius and Fahrenheit say the same thing. Probably not that cold. But then there was wind chill, and the wind was now hard and steady and continuous, blowing over the lake, coming down from the Arctic across Canada.
He remembered, enviously, the chemical hand-and footwarmers he had taken from the men in the black train. He wished he had them now.
Ten more minutes of walking, he guessed, and the bridge seemed to be no nearer. He was too cold to shiver. His eyes hurt. This was not simply cold: this was science fiction. This was a story set on the dark side of Mercury, back when they thought Mercury had a dark side. This was somewhere out on rocky Pluto, where the sun is just another star, shining only a little more brightly in the darkness. This, thought Shadow, is just a hair away from the places where air comes in buckets and pours just like beer.
The occasional cars that roared past him seemed unreal: spaceships, little freeze-dried packages of metal and glass, inhabited by people dressed more warmly than he was. An old song his mother had loved, ""Winter Wonderland,"" began to run through his head, and he hummed it through closed lips, kept pace to it as he walked.
He had lost all sensation in his feet. He looked down at his black leather shoes, at the thin cotton socks, and began, seriously, to worry about frostbite.
This was beyond a joke. This had moved beyond foolishness, slipped over the line into genuine twenty-four-karat Jesus-Christ-I-fucked-up-big-time territory. His clothes might as well have been netting or lace: the wind blew through him, froze his bones and the marrow in his bones, froze the lashes of his eyes, froze the warm place under his balls, which were retreating into his pelvic cavity.
Keep walking, he told himself. Keep walking. I can stop and drink a pail of air when I get home. A Beatles song started in his head, and he adjusted his pace to match it. It was only when he got to the chorus that he realized that he was humming ""Help!""
He was almost at the bridge now. Then he had to walk across it, and he would still be another ten minutes from the stores on the west of the lake-maybe a little more...
A dark car passed him, stopped, then reversed in a foggy cloud of exhaust smoke and came to a halt beside him. A window slid down, and the haze and steam from the window mixed with the exhaust to form a dragon's breath that surrounded the car. ""Everything okay here?"" said a cop inside.
Shadow's first, automatic instinct was to say Yup, everything's just fine and jim-dandy thank you, officer, nothing's happening here. Move on. Nothing to see. But it was too late for that, and he started to say, ""I think I'm freezing. I was walking into Lakeside to buy food and clothes, but I underestimated the length of the walk""-he was that far through the sentence in his head, when he realized that all that had come out was ""F-f-freezing,"" and a chattering noise, and he said, ""So s-sorry. Cold. Sorry.""
The cop pulled open the back door of the car, and said, ""You get in there this moment and warm yourself up, okay?"" Shadow climbed in gratefully, and he sat in the back and rubbed his hands together, trying not to worry about frostbitten toes. The cop got back in the driver's seat. Shadow stared at him through the metal grille. Shadow tried not to think about the last time he'd been in the back of a police car, or to notice that there were no door handles in the back, and to concentrate instead on rubbing life back into his hands. His face hurt and his red fingers hurt, and now, in the warmth, his toes were starting to hurt once more. That was, Shadow figured, a good sign.
The cop put the car in drive and moved off. ""You know, that was,"" he said, not turning to look at Shadow, just talking a little louder, ""if you'll pardon me saying so, a real stupid thing to do. You didn't hear any of the weather advisories? It's minus thirty out there. God alone knows what the wind chill is, minus sixty, minus seventy, although I figure when you're down at minus thirty, wind chill's the least of your worries.""
""Thanks,"" said Shadow. ""Thanks for stopping. Very, very grateful.""
""Woman in Rhinelander went out this morning to fill her bird feeder in her robe and carpet slippers and she froze, literally froze, to the sidewalk. She's in intensive care now. It was on the radio this morning. You're new in town."" It was almost a question, but the man knew the answer already.
""I came in on the Greyhound last night. Figured today I'd buy myself some warm clothes, food, and a car. Wasn't expecting this cold.""
""Yeah,"" said the cop. ""It took me by surprise as well. I was too busy worrying about global warming. I'm Chad Mulligan. I'm the chief of police here in Lakeside.""
""Mike Ainsel.""
""Hi, Mike. Feeling any better?""
""A little, yes.""
""So where would you like me to take you first?""
Shadow put his hands down to the hot air stream, painful on his fingers, then he pulled them away. Let it happen in its own time. ""Can you just drop me off in the town center?""
""Wouldn't hear of it. Long as you don't need me to drive a getaway car for your bank robbery I'll happily take you wherever you need to go. Think of it as the town welcome wagon.""
""Where would you suggest we start?""
""You only moved in last night.""
""That's right.""
""You eaten breakfast yet?""
""Not yet.""
""Well, that seems like a heck of a good starting place to me,"" said Mulligan.
They were over the bridge now, and entering the northwest side of the town. ""This is Main Street,"" said Mulligan, ""and this,"" he said, crossing Main Street and turning right, ""is the town square.""
Even in the winter the town square was impressive, but Shadow knew that this place was meant to be seen in summer: it would be a riot of color, of poppies and irises and flowers of every kind, and the clump of birch trees in one corner would be a green and silver bower. Now it was a colorless place, beautiful in a skeletal way, the band shell empty, the fountain turned off for the winter, the brownstone city hall capped by white snow.
""...and this,"" concluded Chad Mulligan, bringing the car to a stop outside a high glass-fronted old building on the west of the square, ""is Mabel's.""
He got out of the car, opened the rear door for Shadow. The two men put their heads down against the cold and the wind, and hurried across the sidewalk and into a warm room, fragrant with the smells of new-baked bread, of pastry and soup and bacon.
The place was almost empty. Mulligan sat down at a table and Shadow sat opposite him. He suspected that Mulligan was doing this to get a feel for the stranger in town. Then again, the police chief might simply be what he appeared: friendly, helpful, good.
A woman bustled over to their table, not fat but big, a big woman in her sixties, her hair bottle-bronze.
""Hello, Chad,"" she said. ""You'll want a hot chocolate while you're thinking."" She handed them two laminated menus.
""No cream on the top, though,"" he agreed. ""Mabel knows me too well,"" he said to Shadow. ""What'll it be, pal?""
""Hot chocolate sounds great,"" said Shadow. ""And I'm happy to have the whipped cream on the top.""
""That's good,"" said Mabel. ""Live dangerously, hon. Are you going to introduce me, Chad? Is this young man a new officer?""
""Not yet,"" said Chad Mulligan, with a flash of white teeth. ""This is Mike Ainsel. He moved to Lakeside last night. Now, if you'll excuse me."" He got up, walked to the back of the room, through the door marked POINTERS. It was next to a door marked SETTERS.
""You're the new man in the apartment up on Northridge Road. The old Pilsen place. Oh yes,"" she said, happily, ""I know just who you are. Hinzelmann was by this morning for his morning pasty, he told me all about you. You boys only having hot chocolate or you want to look at the breakfast menu?""
""Breakfast for me,"" said Shadow. ""What's good?""
""Everything's good,"" said Mabel. ""I make it. But this is the furthest south and east of the yoopie you can get pasties, and they are particularly good. Warming and filling too. My specialty.""
Shadow had no idea what a pasty was, but he said that would be fine, and in a few moments Mabel returned with a plate with what looked like a folded-over pie on it. The lower half was wrapped in a paper napkin. Shadow picked it up with the napkin and bit into it: it was warm and filled with meat, potatoes, carrots, onions. ""First pasty I've ever had,"" he said. ""It's real good.""
""They're a yoopie thing,"" she told him. ""Mostly you need to be at least up Ironwood way to get one. The Cornish men who came over to work the iron mines brought them over.""
""Yoopie?""
""Upper Peninsula. UP. Yoopie. Where the Yoopers come from. It's the little chunk of Michigan to the northeast.""
The chief of police came back. He picked up the hot chocolate and slurped it. ""Mabel,"" he said, ""are you forcing this nice young man to eat one of your pasties?""
""It's good,"" said Shadow. It was, too-a savory delight wrapped in hot pastry.
""They go straight to the belly,"" said Chad Mulligan, patting his own stomach. ""I warn you. Okay. So, you need a car?"" With his parka off, he was revealed as a lanky man with a round, apple-belly gut on him. He looked harassed and competent, more like an engineer than a cop.
Shadow nodded, mouth full.
""Right. I made some calls. Justin Liebowitz's selling his jeep, wants four thousand dollars for it, will settle for three. The Gunthers have had their Toyota 4Runner for sale for eight months, ugly sonofabitch, but at this point they'd probably pay you to take it out of their driveway. And if you don't care about ugly, it's got to be a great deal. I used the phone in the men's room, left a message for Missy Gunther down at Lakeside Realty, but she wasn't in yet, probably getting her hair done down at Sheila's.""
The pasty remained good as Shadow chewed his way through it. It was astonishingly filling. ""Stick-to-your-ribs food,"" as his mother would have said. ""Sticks to your sides.""
""So,"" said Chief of Police Chad Mulligan, wiping the hot chocolate foam from around his lips. ""I figure we stop off next at Henning's Farm and Home Supplies, get you a real winter wardrobe, swing by Dave's Finest Food, so you can fill your larder, then I'll drop you up by Lakeside Realty. If you can put down a thousand up front for the car they'll be happy, otherwise five hundred a month for four months should see them okay. It's an ugly car, like I said, but if the kid hadn't painted it purple it'd be a ten-thousand-dollar car, and reliable, and you'll need something like that to get around this winter, you ask me.""
""This is very good of you,"" said Shadow. ""But shouldn't you be out catching criminals, not helping newcomers? Not that I'm complaining, you understand.""
Mabel chuckled. ""We all tell him that,"" she said.
Mulligan shrugged. ""It's a good town,"" he said, simply. ""Not much trouble. You'll always get someone speeding within city limits-which is a good thing, as traffic tickets pay my wages. Friday, Saturday nights you get some jerk who gets drunk and beats on a spouse-and that one can go both ways, believe me. Men and women. And I learned when I was on the force in Green Bay, I'd rather attend a bank robbery than a domestic in a big city. But out here things are quiet. They call me out when someone's locked their keys in their vehicle. Barking dogs. Every year there's a couple of high school kids caught with weed behind the bleachers. Biggest police case we've had here in five years was when Dan Schwartz got drunk and shot up his own trailer, then he went on the run, down Main Street, in his wheelchair, waving this darn shotgun, shouting that he would shoot anyone who got in his way, that no one would stop him from getting to the interstate. I think he was on his way to Washington to shoot the president. I still laugh whenever I think of Dan heading down the interstate in that wheelchair of his with the bumper sticker on the back. MY JUVENILE DELINQUENT IS SCREWING YOUR HONOR STUDENT. You remember, Mabel?""
She nodded, lips pursed. She did not seem to find it as funny as Mulligan did.
""What did you do?"" asked Shadow.
""I talked to him. He gave me the shotgun. Slept it off down at the jail. Dan's not a bad guy, he was just drunk and upset.""
Shadow paid for his own breakfast and, over Chad Mulligan's halfhearted protests, both hot chocolates.
Henning's Farm and Home was a warehouse-sized building on the south of the town that sold everything from tractors to toys (the toys, along with the Christmas ornaments, were already on sale). The store was bustling with post-Christmas shoppers. Shadow recognized the younger of the girls who had sat in front of him on the bus. She was trailing after her parents. He waved at her and she gave him a hesitant, blue-rubber-banded smile. Shadow wondered idly what she'd look like in ten years' time.
Probably as beautiful as the girl at the Henning's Farm and Home checkout counter, who scanned in his purchases with a chattering hand-held gun, capable, Shadow had no doubt, of ringing up a tractor if someone drove it through.
""Ten pairs of long underwear?"" said the girl. ""Stocking up, huh?"" She looked like a movie starlet.
Shadow felt fourteen again, and tongue-tied and foolish. He said nothing while she rang up the thermal boots, the gloves, the sweaters, and the goose-down-filled coat.
He had no wish to put the credit card that Wednesday had given him to the test, not with Chief of Police Mulligan standing helpfully beside him, so he paid for everything in cash. Then he took his bags into the men's restroom, and came out wearing many of his purchases.
""Looking good, big fella,"" said Mulligan.
""At least I'm warm,"" said Shadow, and outside, in the parking lot, although the wind burned cold on the skin of his face, the rest of him was warm enough. At Mulligan's invitation, he put his shopping bags in the back of the police car, and rode in the passenger seat, in the front.
""So, what do you do, Mister Ainsel?"" asked the chief of police. ""Big guy like you. What's your profession, and will you be practicing it in Lakeside?""
Shadow's heart began to pound, but his voice was steady. ""I work for my uncle. He buys and sells stuff all over the country. I just do the heavy lifting.""
""Does he pay well?""
""I'm family. He knows I'm not going to rip him off, and I'm learning a little about the trade on the way. Until I figure out what it is I really want to do."" It was coming out of him with conviction, smooth as a snake. He knew everything about big Mike Ainsel in that moment, and he liked Mike Ainsel. Mike Ainsel had none of the problems that Shadow had. Ainsel had never been married. Mike Ainsel had never been interrogated on a freight train by Mr. Wood and Mr. Stone. Televisions did not speak to Mike Ainsel (You want to see Lucy's tits? asked a voice in his head.) Mike Ainsel didn't have bad dreams, or believe that there was a storm coming.
He filled his shopping basket at Dave's Finest Foods, doing what he thought of as a gas-station stop-milk, eggs, bread, apples, cheese, cookies. Just some food. He'd do a real one later. As Shadow moved around, Chad Mulligan said hello to people and introduced Shadow to them. ""This is Mike Ainsel, he's taken the empty apartment at the old Pilsen place. Up around the back,"" he'd say. Shadow gave up trying to remember names. He just shook hands with people and smiled, sweating a little, uncomfortable in his insulated layers in the hot store.
Chad Mulligan drove Shadow across the street to Lakeside Realty. Missy Gunther, her hair freshly set and lacquered, did not need an introduction-she knew exactly who Mike Ainsel was. Why that nice Mr. Borson, his uncle Emerson, such a nice man, he'd been by, what, about six, eight weeks ago now, and rented the apartment up at the old Pilsen place, and wasn't the view just to die for up there? Well, honey, just wait until the spring, and we're so lucky, so many of the lakes in this part of the world go bright green from the algae in the summer, it would turn your stomach, but our lake, well, come fourth of July you could still practically drink it, and Mr. Borson had paid for a whole year's lease in advance, and as for the Toyota 4Runner, she couldn't believe that Chad Mulligan still remembered it, and yes, she'd be delighted to get rid of it. Tell the truth, she'd pretty much resigned herself to giving it to Hinzelmann as this year's klunker and just taking the tax write-off, not that the car was a klunker, far from it, no, it was her son's car before he went to school in Green Bay, and, well, he'd painted it purple one day and, ha-ha, she certainly hoped that Mike Ainsel liked purple, that was all she had to say, and if he didn't she wouldn't blame him...
Chief of Police Mulligan excused himself near the middle of this litany. ""Looks like they need me back at the office, good meeting you, Mike,"" he said, and he moved Shadow's shopping bags into the back of Missy Gunther's station wagon.
Missy drove Shadow back to her place, where, in the drive, he saw an elderly SUV. The blown snow had bleached half of it to a blinding white, while the rest of it was painted the kind of drippy purple that someone would need to be very stoned, very often, to even begin to be able to find attractive.
Still, the car started up on the first try, and the heater worked, although it took almost ten minutes of running the engine with the heater on full before it even started to change the interior of the car from unbearably cold to merely chilly. While this was happening, Missy Gunther took Shadow into her kitchen-excuse the mess, but the little ones just leave their toys all over after Christmas and she just doesn't have the heart, would he care for some leftover turkey dinner? Last year they did goose but this year it was a big old turkey, well, coffee then, won't take a moment to brew a fresh pot-and Shadow took a large red toy car off a window seat and sat down, while Missy Gunther asked if he had met his neighbors yet, and Shadow confessed that he hadn't.
There were, he was informed, while the coffee dripped and brewed, four other inhabitants of his apartment building-back when it was the Pilsen place the Pilsens lived in the downstairs flat and rented out the upper two flats, now their apartment, that was the downstairs one and that was taken by a couple of young men, Mr. Holz and Mr. Neiman, they actually are a couple and when she said couple, Mr. Ainsel, heavens, we have all kinds here, more than one kind of tree in the forest, although mostly those kind of people wind up in Madison or the Twin Cities, but truth to tell, nobody here gives it a second thought. They're in Key West for the winter, they'll be back in April, he'll meet them then. The thing about Lakeside is that it's a good town. Now next door to Mr. Ainsel, that's Marguerite Olsen and her little boy, a sweet lady, sweet, sweet lady, but she's had a hard life, still sweet as pie, and she works for the Lakeside News. Not the most exciting newspaper in the world, but truth to tell Missy Gunther thought that was probably the way most folk around here liked it.
Oh, she said, and poured him coffee, she just wished that Mr. Ainsel could see the town in the summer or late in the spring, when the lilacs and the apple and the cherry blossoms were out, she thought there was nothing like it for beauty, nothing like it anywhere in the world.
Shadow gave her a five-hundred-dollar deposit, and he climbed up into the car and started to back it up, out of her front yard and onto the driveway proper. Missy Gunther tapped on his front window. ""This is for you,"" she said. ""I nearly forgot."" She handed him a buff envelope. ""It's kind of a gag. We had them printed up a few years back. You don't have to look at it now.""
He thanked her, and drove, cautiously, back into the town. He took the road that ran around the lake. He wished he could see it in the spring, or the summer, or the fall: it would be very beautiful, he had no doubt of that.
In ten minutes he was home.
He parked the car out on the street and walked up the outside steps to his cold apartment. He unpacked his shopping, put the food into the cupboards and the fridge, and then he opened the envelope Missy Gunther had given him.
It contained a passport. Blue, laminated cover and, inside, a proclamation that Michael Ainsel (his name handwritten in Missy Gunther's precise handwriting) was a citizen of Lakeside. There was a map of the town on the next page. The rest of it was filled with discount coupons for various local stores.
""I think I may like it here,"" said Shadow, aloud. He looked out of the icy window at the frozen lake. ""If it ever warms up.""
There was a bang at the front door at around 2:00 P.M. Shadow had been practicing the Sucker Vanish with a quarter, tossing it from one hand to the other undetectably. His hands were cold enough and clumsy enough that he kept dropping the coin onto the table, and the knock at the door made him drop it again.
He went to the door and opened it.
A moment of pure fear: the man at the door wore a black mask which covered the lower half of his face. It was the kind of mask that a bank robber might wear on TV, or a serial killer from a cheap movie might wear to scare his victims. The top of the man's head was covered by a black knit cap.
Still, the man was smaller and slighter than Shadow, and he did not appear to be armed. And he wore a bright plaid coat, of the kind that serial killers normally avoid.
""Ih hihelhan,"" said the visitor.
""Huh?""
The man pulled the mask downward, revealing Hinzelmann's cheerful face. ""I said, it's Hinzelmann. You know, I don't know what we did before they came up with these masks. Well, I do remember what we did. Thick knitted caps that went all around your face, and scarves and you don't want to know what else. I think it's a miracle what they come up with these days. I may be an old man, but I'm not going to grumble about progress, not me.""
He finished this speech by thrusting a basket at Shadow, filled high with local cheeses, bottles, jars, and several small salamis that proclaimed themselves to be venison summer sausage, and by coming inside. ""Merry Day after Christmas,"" he said. His nose and ears and cheeks were red as raspberries, mask or no mask. ""I hear you already ate a whole one of Mabel's pasties. Brought you a few things.""
""That's very kind of you,"" said Shadow.
""Kind, nothing. I'm going to stick it to you next week for the raffle. The chamber of commerce runs it, and I run the chamber of commerce. Last year we raised almost seventeen thousand dollars for the children's ward of Lakeside Hospital.""
""Well, why don't you put me down for a ticket now?""
""It don't start until the day the klunker hits the ice,"" said Hinzelmann. He looked out of Shadow's window toward the lake. ""Cold out there. Must have dropped fifty degrees last night.""
""It happened really fast,"" agreed Shadow.
""We used to pray for freezes like this back in the old days,"" said Hinzelmann. ""My daddy told me. When the settlers were first coming into these parts, farming people and lumber people, long before ever the mining people came out, although the mines never really happened in this county, which they could have done, for there's iron enough under there...""
""You'd pray for days like this?"" interrupted Shadow.
""Well, yah, it was the only way the settlers survived back then. Weren't enough food for everyone, and you couldn't just go down to Dave's and fill up your shopping trolley in the old days, no, sir. So my grampaw, he got to thinking, and when a really cold day like this come along he'd take my grammaw, and the kids, my uncle and my aunt and my daddy-he was the youngest-and the serving girl and the hired man, and he'd go down with them to the creek, give 'em a little rum-and-herbs drink, it was a recipe he'd got from the old country, then he'd pour creek water over them. Course they'd freeze in seconds, stiff and blue as so many popsicles. He'd haul them to a trench they'd already dug and filled with straw, and he'd stack 'em down there, one by one, like so much cordwood in the trench, and he'd pack straw around them, then he'd cover the top of the trench with two-b'-fours to keep the critters out-in those days there were wolves and bears and all sorts you never see any more around here, no hodags though, that's just a story about the hodags and I wouldn't ever stretch your credulity by telling you no stories, no, sir,-he'd cover the trench with two-b'-fours and the next snowfall would cover it up completely, save for the flag he'd planted to show him where the trench was.
""Then my grampaw would ride through the winter in comfort and never have to worry about running out of food or out of fuel. And when he saw that the true spring was coming he'd go to the flag, and he'd dig his way down through the snow, and he'd move the two-b'-fours, and he'd carry them in one by one and set the family in front of the fire to thaw. Nobody ever minded except one of the hired men who lost half an ear to a family of mice who nibbled it off one time my grampaw didn't push those two-b'-fours all the way closed. Of course, in those days we had real winters. You could do that back then. These pussy winters we get nowadays it don't hardly get cold enough.""
""No?"" asked Shadow. He was playing straight-man, and enjoying it enormously.
""Not since the winter of '49 and you'd be too young to remember that one. That was a winter. I see you bought yourself a vee-hicle.""
""Yup. What do you think?""
""Truth to tell, I never liked that Gunther boy. I had a trout stream down in the woods a way, on back of my property, way back, well it's town land but I'd put down stones in the river, made little pools and places where the trout liked to live. Caught me some beauties too-one fellow must have been pretty much thirty inches long, and that little Gunther so-an'-so he kicked down each of the pools and threatened to report me to the DNR. Now he's in Green Bay, and soon enough he'll be back here. If there were any justice in the world he'd've gone off into the world as a winter runaway, but nope, sticks like a cockleburr to a woolen vest."" He began to arrange the contents of Shadow's welcome basket on the counter. ""This is Katherine Powdermaker's crab apple jelly. She's been giving me a pot for Christmas for longer than you've been alive, and the sad truth is I've never opened a one. They're down in my basement, forty, fifty pots. Maybe I'll open one and discover that I like the stuff. Meantime, here's a pot for you. Maybe you'll like it.""
Shadow put the jar away in the fridge, along with the other presents that Hinzelmann had brought him. ""What's this?"" he asked, holding up a tall, unlabeled bottle filled with a greenish buttery substance.
""Olive oil. That's how it looks when it gets this cold. Don't worry, it'll cook up fine.""
""Okay. What are winter runaways?""
""Mm."" The old man pushed his woolen cap above his ears, rubbed his temple with a pink forefinger. ""Well, it ain't unique to Lakeside-we're a good town, better than most, but we're not perfect. Some winters, well, maybe a kid gets a bit stir-crazy, when it gets so cold that you can't go out, and the snow's so dry that you can't make so much as a snowball without it crumbling away...""
""They run off?""
The old man nodded, gravely. ""I blame the television, showing all the kids things they'll never have-Dallas and Dynasty and Beverly Hills and Hawaii Five-O, all of that nonsense. I've not had a television since the fall of '83, except for a black-and-white set I keep in the closet for if folk come in from out of town and there's a big game on.""
""Can I get you anything, Hinzelmann?""
""Not coffee. Gives me heartburn. Just water."" Hinzelmann shook his head. ""Biggest problem in this part of the world is poverty. Not the poverty we had in the Depression but something more in...what's the word, means it creeps in at the edges, like cock-a-roaches?""
""Insidious?""
""Yeah. Insidious. Logging's dead. Mining's dead. Tourists don't drive further north than the Dells, 'cept for a handful of hunters and some kids going to camp on the lakes-and they aren't spending their money in the towns.""
""Lakeside seems kind of prosperous, though.""
The old man's blue eyes blinked. ""And believe me, it takes a lot of work,"" he said. ""Hard work. But this is a good town, and all the work all the people here put into it is worthwhile. Not that my family weren't poor as kids. Ask me how poor we was as kids.""
Shadow put on his straight-man face and said, ""How poor were you as kids, Mister Hinzelmann?""
""Just Hinzelmann, Mike. We were so poor that we couldn't afford a fire. Come New Year's Eve my father would suck on a peppermint, and us kids, we'd stand around with our hands outstretched, basking in the glow.""
Shadow made a rim-shot noise. Hinzelmann put on his ski-mask and did up his huge plaid coat, pulled out his car keys from his pocket and then, last of all, pulled on his great gloves. ""You get too bored up here, you just come down to the store and ask for me. I'll show you my collection of hand-tied fishing flies. Bore you so much that getting back here will be a relief."" His voice was muffled, but audible.
""I'll do that,"" said Shadow with a smile. ""How's Tessie?""
""Hibernating. She'll be out in the spring. You take care now, Mister Ainsel."" And he closed the door behind him as he left.
The apartment grew ever colder.
Shadow put on his coat and his gloves. Then he put on his boots. He could hardly see through the windows now for the ice on the inside of the panes which turned the view of the lake into an abstract image.
His breath was clouding in the air.
He went out of his apartment onto the wooden deck and knocked on the door next door. He heard a woman's voice shouting at someone to for heaven's sake shut up and turn that television down-a kid he thought, adults don't shout like that at other adults, not with that tone in their voice. The door opened and a tired woman with very long, very black hair was staring at him warily.
""Yes?""
""How do you do, ma'am. I'm Mike Ainsel. I'm your next-door neighbor.""
Her expression did not change, not by a hair. ""Yes?""
""Ma'am. It's freezing in my apartment. There's a little heat coming out of the grate, but it's not warming the place up, not at all.""
She looked him up and down, then a ghost of a smile touched the edges of her lips and she said, ""Come in, then. If you don't there'll be no heat in here, either.""
He stepped inside her apartment. Plastic, multicolored toys were strewn all over the floor. There were small heaps of torn Christmas wrapping paper by the wall. A small boy sat inches away from the television set, a video of the Disney Hercules playing, an animated satyr stomping and shouting his way across the screen. Shadow kept his back to the TV set.
""Okay,"" she said. ""This is what you do. First you seal the windows, you can buy the stuff down at Henning's, it's just like Saran wrap but for windows. Tape it to the windows, then if you want to get fancy you run a blow-dryer on it, it stays there the whole winter. That stops the heat leaving through the windows. Then you buy a space heater or two. The building's furnace is old, and it can't cope with the real cold. We've had some easy winters recently, I suppose we should be grateful."" Then she put out her hand. ""Marguerite Olsen.""
""Good to meet you,"" said Shadow. He pulled off a glove and they shook hands. ""You know, ma'am, I'd always thought of Olsens as being blonder than you.""
""My ex-husband was as blond as they came. Pink and blond. Couldn't tan at gunpoint.""
""Missy Gunther told me you write for the local paper.""
""Missy Gunther tells everybody everything. I don't see why we need a local paper with Missy Gunther around."" She nodded. ""Yes. Some news reporting here and there, but my editor writes most of the news. I write the nature column, the gardening column, an opinion column every Sunday and the 'News From the Community' column which tells, in mind-numbing detail, who went to dinner with who for fifteen miles around. Or is that whom?""
""Whom,"" said Shadow, before he could stop himself. ""It's the objective case.""
She looked at him with her black eyes, and Shadow experienced a moment of pure déjà vu. I've been here before, he thought.
No, she reminds me of someone.
""Anyway, that's how you heat up your apartment,"" she said.
""Thank you,"" said Shadow. ""When it's warm you and your little one must come over.""
""His name's Leon,"" she said. ""Good meeting you, Mister...I'm sorry...""
""Ainsel,"" said Shadow. ""Mike Ainsel.""
""And what sort of a name is Ainsel?"" she asked.
Shadow had no idea. ""My name,"" he said. ""I'm afraid I was never very interested in family history.""
""Norwegian, maybe?"" she said.
""We were never close,"" he said. Then he remembered Uncle Emerson Borson, and added, ""On that side, anyway.""
  
By the time that Mr. Wednesday arrived, Shadow had put clear plastic sheeting across all the windows and had one space heater running in the main room and one in the bedroom at the back. It was practically cozy.
""What the hell is that purple piece of shit you're driving?"" asked Wednesday, by way of greeting.
""Well,"" said Shadow, ""you drove off with my white piece of shit. Where is it, by the way?""
""I traded it in in Duluth,"" said Wednesday. ""You can't be too careful. Don't worry-you'll get your share when all this is done.""
""What am I doing here?"" asked Shadow. ""In Lakeside, I mean. Not in the world.""
Wednesday smiled his smile, the one that made Shadow want to hit him. ""You're living here because it's the last place they'll look for you. I can keep you out of sight here.""
""By they you mean the black hats?""
""Exactly. I'm afraid the House on the Rock is now out of bounds. It's a little difficult, but we'll cope. Now it's just stamping our feet and flag-waving, caracole and saunter until the action starts-a little later than any of us expected. I think they'll hold off until spring. Nothing big can happen until then.""
""How come?""
""Because they may babble on about micro-milliseconds and virtual worlds and paradigm shifts and what-have-you, but they still inhabit this planet and are still bound by the cycle of the year. These are the dead months. A victory in these months is a dead victory.""
""I have no idea what you're talking about,"" said Shadow. That was not entirely true. He had a vague idea, and he hoped it was wrong.
""It's going to be a bad winter, and you and I are going to use our time as wisely as we can. We shall rally our troops and pick our battleground.""
""Okay,"" said Shadow. He knew that Wednesday was telling him the truth, or a part of a truth. War was coming. No, that was not it: the war had already begun. The battle was coming. ""Mad Sweeney said that he was working for you when we met him that first night. He said that before he died.""
""And would I have wanted to employ someone who could not even best a sad case like that in a bar fight? But never fear, you've repaid my faith in you a dozen times over. Have you ever been to Las Vegas?""
""Las Vegas, Nevada?""
""That's the one.""
""No.""
""We're flying in there from Madison later tonight, on a gentleman's red-eye, a charter plane for High Rollers. I've convinced them that we should be on it.""
""Don't you ever get tired of lying?"" asked Shadow. He said it gently, curiously.
""Not in the slightest. Anyway, it's true. We are playing for the highest stakes of all. It shouldn't take us more than a couple of hours to get to Madison, the roads are clear. So lock your door and turn off the heaters. It would be a terrible thing if you burned down the house in your absence.""
""Who are we going to see in Las Vegas?""
Wednesday told him.
Shadow turned off the heaters, packed some clothes into an overnight bag, then turned back to Wednesday and said, ""Look, I feel kind of stupid. I know you just told me who we're going to see, but I dunno. I just had a brain-fart or something. It's gone. Who is it again?""
Wednesday told him once more.
This time Shadow almost had it. The name was there on the tip of his mind. He wished he'd been paying closer attention when Wednesday told him. He let it go.
""Who's driving?"" he asked Wednesday.
""You are,"" said Wednesday. They walked out of the house, down the wooden stairs and the icy path to where a black Lincoln town car was parked.
Shadow drove.
  
Entering the casino one is beset at every side by invitation-invitations such that it would take a man of stone, heartless, mindless, and curiously devoid of avarice, to decline them. Listen: a machine gun rattle of silver coins as they tumble and spurt down into a slot machine tray and overflow onto monogrammed carpets is replaced by the siren clangor of the slots, the jangling, blippeting chorus swallowed by the huge room, muted to a comforting background chatter by the time one reaches the card tables, the distant sounds only loud enough to keep the adrenaline flowing through the gamblers' veins.
There is a secret that the casinos possess, a secret they hold and guard and prize, the holiest of their mysteries. For most people do not gamble to win money, after all, although that is what is advertised, sold, claimed and dreamed. But that is merely the easy lie that allows the gamblers to lie to themselves, the big lie that gets them through the enormous, ever-open, welcoming doors.
The secret is this: people gamble to lose money. They come to the casinos for the moment in which they feel alive, to ride the spinning wheel and turn with the cards and lose themselves, with the coins, in the slots. They want to know they matter. They may brag about the nights they won, the money they took from the casino, but they treasure, secretly treasure, the times they lost. It's a sacrifice, of sorts.
The money flows through the casino in an uninterrupted stream of green and silver, streaming from hand to hand, from gambler to croupier, to cashier, to the management, to security, finally ending up in the Holy of Holies, the innermost sanctum, the Counting Room. And it is here, in the counting room of this casino, that you come to rest, here, where the greenbacks are sorted, stacked, indexed, here in a space that is slowly becoming redundant as more and more of the money that flows through the casino is imaginary: an electrical sequence of ons and offs, sequences that flow down telephone lines.
In the Counting Room you see three men, counting money under the glassy stare of the cameras they can see, the insectile gazes of the tiny cameras they cannot see. During the course of one shift each of the men counts more money than he will see in all the pay packets of his life. Each man, when he sleeps, dreams of counting money, of stacks and paper bands and numbers which climb inevitably, which are sorted and lost. Each of the three men has idly wondered, not less than once a week, how to evade the casino's security systems and run off with as much money as he could haul; and, reluctantly, each man has inspected the dream and found it impractical, has settled for a steady paycheck, avoided the twin specters of prison and an unmarked grave.
And here, in the sanctum sanctorum, there are the three men who count the money, and there are the guards who watch and who bring money and take it away; and then there is another person. His charcoal-gray suit is immaculate, his hair is dark, he is clean-shaven, and his face, and his demeanor, are, in every sense, forgettable. None of the other men has even observed that he is there, or if they have noticed him, they have forgotten him on the instant.
As the shift ends the doors are opened, and the man in the charcoal suit leaves the room and walks, with the guards, through the corridors, their feet shushing along the monogrammed carpets. The money, in strongboxes, is wheeled to an interior loading bay, where it is loaded into armored cars. As the ramp door swings open, to allow the armored car out onto the early streets of Las Vegas, the man in the charcoal suit walks, unnoticed, through the doorway, and saunters up the ramp, out onto the sidewalk. He does not even glance up to see the imitation of New York on his left.
Las Vegas has become a child's picture book dream of a city-here a storybook castle, there a sphinx-flanked black pyramid beaming white light into the darkness as a landing beam for UFOs, and everywhere neon oracles and twisting screens predict happiness and good fortune, announce singers and comedians and magicians in residence or on their way, and the lights always flash and beckon and call. Once every hour a volcano erupts in light and flame. Once every hour a pirate ship sinks a man o' war.
The man in the charcoal suit ambles comfortably along the sidewalk, feeling the flow of the money through the town. In the summer the streets are baking, and each store doorway he passes breathes wintry A/C out into the sweaty warmth and chills the sweat on his face. Now, in the desert winter, there's a dry cold, which he appreciates. In his mind the movement of money forms a fine lattice-work, a three-dimensional cat's-cradle of light and motion. What he finds attractive about this desert city is the speed of movement, the way the money moves from place to place and hand to hand: it's a rush for him, a high, and it pulls him like an addict to the street.
A taxi follows him slowly down the street, keeping its distance. He does not notice it; it does not occur to him to notice it: he is so rarely noticed himself that he finds the concept that he could be being followed almost inconceivable.
It's four in the morning, and he finds himself drawn to a hotel and casino that has been out of style for thirty years, still running until tomorrow or six months from now when they'll implode it and knock it down and build a pleasure palace where it was, and forget it forever. Nobody knows him, nobody remembers him, but the lobby bar is tacky and quiet, and the air is blue with old cigarette smoke and someone's about to drop several million dollars on a poker game in a private room upstairs. The man in the charcoal suit settles himself in the bar several floors below the game, and is ignored by a waitress. A Muzak version of ""Why Can't He Be You"" is playing, almost subliminally. Five Elvis Presley impersonators, each man wearing a different colored jumpsuit, watch a late-night rerun of a football game on the bar TV.
A big man in a light gray suit sits at the man in the charcoal suit's table, and, noticing him even if she does not notice the man in the charcoal suit, the waitress, who is too thin to be pretty, too obviously anorectic to work Luxor or the Tropicana, and who is counting the minutes until she gets off work, comes straight over and smiles. He grins widely at her. ""You're looking a treat tonight, m'dear, a fine sight for these poor old eyes,"" he says, and, scenting a large tip, she smiles broadly at him. The man in the light gray suit orders a Jack Daniel's for himself and a Laphroaig and water for the man in the charcoal suit sitting beside him.
""You know,"" says the man in the light gray suit, when his drink arrives, ""the finest line of poetry ever uttered in the history of this whole damn country was said by Canada Bill Jones in 1853, in Baton Rouge, while he was being robbed blind in a crooked game of faro. George Devol, who was, like Canada Bill, not a man who was averse to fleecing the odd sucker, drew Bill aside and asked him if he couldn't see that the game was crooked. And Canada Bill sighed, and shrugged his shoulders, and said, 'I know. But it's the only game in town.' And he went back to the game.""
Dark eyes stare at the man in the light gray suit distrustfully. The man in the charcoal suit says something in reply. The man in the light suit, who has a graying reddish beard, shakes his head.
""Look,"" he says, ""I'm sorry about what went down in Wisconsin. But I got you all out safely, didn't I? No one was hurt.""
The man in the dark suit sips his Laphroaig and water, savoring the marshy taste, the body-in-the-bog quality of the whisky. He asks a question.
""I don't know. Everything's moving faster than I expected. Everyone's got a hard-on for the kid I hired to run errands-I've got him outside, waiting in the taxi. Are you still in?""
The man in the dark suit replies.
The bearded man shakes his head. ""She's not been seen for two hundred years. If she isn't dead she's taken herself out of the picture.""
Something else is said.
""Look,"" says the bearded man, knocking back his Jack Daniel's. ""You come in, be there when we need you, and I'll take care of you. Whaddayou want? Soma? I can get you a bottle of Soma. The real stuff.""
The man in the dark suit stares. Then he nods his head, reluctantly, and makes a comment.
""Of course I am,"" says the bearded man, smiling like a knife. ""What do you expect? But look at it this way: it's the only game in town."" He reaches out a paw-like hand and shakes the other man's well-manicured hand. Then he walks away.
The thin waitress comes over, puzzled: there's now only one man at the corner table, a sharply dressed man with dark hair in a charcoal-gray suit. ""You doing okay?"" she asks. ""Is your friend coming back?""
The man with the dark hair sighs, and explains that his friend won't be coming back, and thus she won't be paid for her time, or for her trouble. And then, seeing the hurt in her eyes, and taking pity on her, he examines the golden threads in his mind, watches the matrix, follows the money until he spots a node, and tells her that if she's outside Treasure Island at 6:00 A.M., thirty minutes after she gets off work, she'll meet an oncologist from Denver who will just have won $40,000 at a craps table, and will need a mentor, a partner, someone to help him dispose of it all in the forty-eight hours before he gets on the plane home.
The words evaporate in the waitress's mind, but they leave her happy. She sighs and notes that the guys in the corner have done a runner, and have not even tipped her; and it occurs to her that, instead of driving straight home when she gets off shift, she's going to drive over to Treasure Island; but she would never, if you asked her, be able to tell you why.
  
So who was that guy you were seeing?"" asked Shadow as they walked back down the Las Vegas concourse. There were slot machines in the airport. Even at this time of the morning people stood in front of them, feeding them coins. Shadow wondered if there were those who never left the airport, who got off their planes, walked along the Jetway into the airport building and stopped there, trapped by the spinning images and the flashing lights; people who would stay in the airport until they had fed their last quarter to the machines, and then would turn around and get onto the plane back home.
He guessed it must have happened. He suspected that there wasn't much that hadn't happened in Las Vegas at some point or other. And America was so damn big that with so many people there was always bound to be somebody.
And then he realized that he had zoned out just as Wednesday had been telling him who the man in the dark suit they had followed in the taxi had been, and he had missed it.
""So he's in,"" said Wednesday. ""It'll cost me a bottle of Soma, though.""
""What's Soma?""
""It's a drink."" They walked onto the charter plane, empty but for them and a trio of corporate big spenders who needed to be back in Chicago by the start of the next business day.
Wednesday got comfortable, ordered himself a Jack Daniel's. ""My kind of people see your kind of people..."" He hesitated. ""It's like bees and honey. Each bee makes only a tiny, tiny drop of honey. It takes thousands of them, millions perhaps, all working together to make the pot of honey you have on your breakfast table. Now imagine that you could eat nothing but honey. That's what it's like for my kind of people...we feed on belief, on prayers, on love. It takes a lot of people believing just the tiniest bit to sustain us. That's what we need, instead of food. Belief.""
""And Soma is...""
""To take the analogy further, it's honey wine. Mead."" He chuckled. ""It's a drink. Concentrated prayer and belief, distilled into a potent liqueur.""
They were somewhere over Nebraska eating an unimpressive in-flight breakfast when Shadow said, ""My wife.""
""The dead one.""
""Laura. She doesn't want to be dead. She told me. After she got me away from the guys on the train.""
""The action of a fine wife. Freeing you from durance vile and murdering those who would have harmed you. You should treasure her, Nephew Ainsel.""
""She wants to be really alive. Not one of the walking dead, or whatever she is. She wants to live again. Can we do that? Is that possible?""
Wednesday said nothing for long enough that Shadow started to wonder if he had heard the question, or if he had, possibly, fallen asleep with his eyes open. Then he said, staring ahead of him as he talked, ""I know a charm that can cure pain and sickness, and lift the grief from the heart of the grieving.
""I know a charm that will heal with a touch.
""I know a charm that will turn aside the weapons of an enemy.
""I know another charm to free myself from all bonds and locks.
""A fifth charm: I can catch a bullet in flight and take no harm from it.""
His words were quiet, urgent. Gone was the hectoring tone, gone was the grin. Wednesday spoke as if he were reciting the words of a religious ritual, as if he were speaking something dark and painful.
""A sixth: spells sent to hurt me will hurt only the sender.
""A seventh charm I know: I can quench a fire simply by looking at it.
""An eighth: if any man hates me, I can win his friendship.
""A ninth: I can sing the wind to sleep and calm a storm for long enough to bring a ship to shore.
""Those were the first nine charms I learned. Nine nights I hung on the bare tree, my side pierced with a spear's point. I swayed and blew in the cold winds and the hot winds, without food, without water, a sacrifice of myself to myself, and the worlds opened to me.
""For a tenth charm, I learned to dispel witches, to spin them around in the skies so that they will never find their way back to their own doors again.
""An eleventh: if I sing it when a battle rages it can take warriors through the tumult unscathed and unhurt, and bring them safely back to their hearth and their home.
""A twelfth charm I know: if I see a hanged man I can bring him down from the gallows to whisper to us all he remembers.
""A thirteenth: if I sprinkle water on a child's head, that child will not fall in battle.
""A fourteenth: I know the names of all the gods. Every damned one of them.
""A fifteenth: I have a dream of power, of glory, and of wisdom, and I can make people believe my dreams.""
His voice was so low now that Shadow had to strain to hear it over the plane's engine noise.
""A sixteenth charm I know: if I need love I can turn the mind and heart of any woman.
""A seventeenth, that no woman I want will ever want another.
""And I know an eighteenth charm, and that charm is the greatest of all, and that charm I can tell to no man, for a secret that no one knows but you is the most powerful secret there can ever be.""
He sighed, and then stopped talking.
Shadow could feel his skin crawl. It was as if he had just seen a door open to another place, somewhere worlds away where hanged men blew in the wind at every crossroads, where witches shrieked overhead in the night.
""Laura,"" was all he said.
Wednesday turned his head, stared into Shadow's pale gray eyes with his own. ""I can't make her live again,"" he said. ""I don't even know why she isn't as dead as she ought to be.""
""I think I did it,"" said Shadow. ""It was my fault.""
Wednesday raised a bushy eyebrow.
""Mad Sweeney gave me a golden coin, back when he showed me how to do that trick. From what he said, he gave me the wrong coin. What he gave me was something more powerful than what he thought he was giving me. I passed it on to Laura.""
Wednesday grunted, lowered his chin to his chest, frowned. Then he sat back. ""That could do it,"" he said. ""And no, I can't help you. What you do in your own time is your own affair, of course.""
""What,"" asked Shadow, ""is that supposed to mean?""
""It means that I can't stop you from hunting eagle stones or thunderbirds. But I would infinitely prefer that you spend your days quietly sequestered in Lakeside, out of sight, and, I hope, out of mind. When things get hairy we'll need all hands to the wheel.""
He looked very old as he said this, and fragile, and his skin seemed almost transparent, and the flesh beneath was gray.
Shadow wanted, wanted very much, to reach out and put his hand over Wednesday's gray hand. He wanted to tell him that everything would be okay-something that Shadow did not feel, but that he knew had to be said. There were men in black trains out there. There was a fat kid in a stretch limo and there were people in the television who did not mean them well.
He did not touch Wednesday. He did not say anything.
Later, he wondered if he could have changed things, if that gesture would have done any good, if it could have averted any of the harm that was to come. He told himself it wouldn't. He knew it wouldn't. But still, afterward, he wished that, just for a moment on that slow flight home, he had touched Wednesday's hand.
  
The brief winter daylight was already fading when Wednesday dropped Shadow outside his apartment. The freezing temperature when Shadow opened the car door felt even more science fictional when compared to Las Vegas.
""Don't get into any trouble,"" said Wednesday. ""Keep your head below the parapet. Make no waves.""
""All at the same time?""
""Don't get smart with me, m'boy. You can keep out of sight in Lakeside. I pulled in a big favor to keep you here, safe and sound. If you were in a city they'd get your scent in minutes.""
""I'll stay put and keep out of trouble."" Shadow meant it as he said it. He'd had a lifetime of trouble and he was ready to let it go forever. ""When are you coming back?"" he asked.
""Soon,"" said Wednesday, and he gunned the Lincoln's engine, slid up the window and drove off into the frigid night.

Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.
-BEN FRANKLIN, POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK 
Three cold days passed. The thermometer never made it up to the zero mark, not even at midday. Shadow wondered how people had survived this weather in the days before electricity, before thermal face masks and lightweight thermal underwear, before easy travel.
He was down at the Video, Tanning, Bait, and Tackle store, being shown Hinzelmann's hand-tied trout flies. They were more interesting than he had expected: colorful fakes of life, made of feather and thread, each with a hook hidden inside it.
He asked Hinzelmann.
""For real?"" asked Hinzelmann.
""For real,"" said Shadow.
""Well,"" said the older man. ""Sometimes they didn't survive it, and they died. Leaky chimneys and badly ventilated stoves and ranges killed as many people as the cold. But those days were hard-they'd spend the summer and the fall laying up the food and the firewood for the winter. The worst thing of all was the madness. I heard on the radio, they were saying how it was to do with the sunlight, how there isn't enough of it in the winter. My daddy, he said folk just went stir-crazy-winter madness they called it. Lakeside always had it easy, but some of the other towns around here, they had it hard. There was a saying still had currency when I was a kid, that if the serving girl hadn't tried to kill you by February she hadn't any backbone.
""Storybooks were like gold-dust-anything you could read was treasured, back before the town had a lending library. When my grampaw got sent a storybook from his brother in Bavaria, all the Germans in town met up in the town hall to hear him read it, and the Finns and the Irish and the rest of them, they'd make the Germans tell them the stories.
""Twenty miles south of here, in Jibway, they found a woman walking mother-naked in the winter with a dead babe at her breast, and she'd not suffer them to take it from her."" He shook his head meditatively, closed the fly cabinet with a click. ""Bad business. You want a video rental card? Eventually they'll open a Blockbuster here, and then we'll soon be out of business. But for now we got a pretty fair selection.""
Shadow reminded Hinzelmann that he had no television and no VCR. He enjoyed Hinzelmann's company-the reminiscences, the tall tales, the goblin grin of the old man. It could make things awkward between them were Shadow to admit that television had made him uncomfortable ever since it had started to talk to him.
Hinzelmann fished in a drawer, and took out a tin box-by the look of it, it had once been a Christmas Box, of the kind that contained chocolates or cookies: a mottled Santa Claus, holding a tray of Coca-Cola bottles, beamed up from its lid. Hinzelmann eased off the metal top of the box, revealing a notebook and books of blank tickets, and said, ""How many you want me to put you down for?""
""How many of what?""
""Klunker tickets. She'll go out onto the ice today, so we've started selling tickets. Each ticket is ten dollars, five for forty, ten for seventy-five. One ticket buys you five minutes. Of course we can't promise it'll go down in your five minutes, but the person who's closest stands to win five hundred bucks, and if it goes down in your five minutes, you win a thousand dollars. The earlier you buy your tickets, the more times aren't spoken for. You want to see the info sheet?""
""Sure.""
Hinzelmann handed Shadow a photocopied sheet. The klunker was an old car with its engine and fuel tank removed, which would be parked out on the ice for the winter. Sometime in the spring the lake ice would melt, and when it was too thin to bear the car's weight the car would fall into the lake. The earliest the klunker had ever tumbled into the lake was February the twenty-seventh (""That was the winter of 1998. I don't think you could rightly call that a winter at all""), the latest was May the first (""That was 1950. Seemed that year that the only way that winter would end was if somebody hammered a stake through its heart""). The beginning of April appeared to be the most common time for the car to sink-normally in mid-afternoon.
All of the mid-afternoons in April had already gone, marked off in Hinzelmann's lined notebook. Shadow bought a twenty-five-minute period on the morning of March the twenty-third, from 9:00 A.M. to 9: 25 A.M. He handed Hinzelmann forty dollars.
""I just wish everybody in town was as easy a sell as you are,"" said Hinzelmann.
""It's a thank-you for that ride you gave me that first night I was in town.""
""No, Mike,"" said Hinzelmann. ""It's for the children."" For a moment he looked serious, with no trace of impishness on his creased old face. ""Come down this afternoon, you can lend a hand pushing the klunker out onto the lake.""
He passed Shadow five blue cards, each with a date and time written on it in Hinzelmann's old-fashioned handwriting, then entered the details of each in his notebook.
""Hinzelmann,"" asked Shadow. ""Have you ever heard of eagle stones?""
""Up north of Rhinelander? Nope, that's Eagle River. Can't say I have.""
""How about thunderbirds?""
""Well, there was the Thunderbird Framing Gallery up on Fifth Street, but that closed down. I'm not helping, am I?""
""Nope.""
""Tell you what, why don't you go look at the library. Good people, although they may be kind of distracted by the library sale on this week. I showed you where the library was, didn't I?""
Shadow nodded, and said so long. He wished he'd thought of the library himself. He got into the purple 4Runner and drove south on Main Street, following the lake around to the southernmost point, until he reached the castle-like building which housed the city library. He walked inside. A sign pointed to the basement: LIBRARY SALE, it said. The library proper was on the ground floor, and he stamped the snow off his boots and went in.
A forbidding woman with pursed, crimson-colored lips asked him pointedly if she could help him.
""I suppose I need a library card,"" he said. ""And I want to know all about thunderbirds.""
The woman had him fill out a form, then she told him it would take a week until he could be issued with his card. Shadow wondered if they spent the week sending out inquiries to ensure that he was not wanted in any other libraries across America for failure to return library books.
He had known a man in prison who had been imprisoned for stealing library books.
""Sounds kind of rough,"" said Shadow, when the man told him why he was inside.
""Half a million dollars' worth of books,"" said the man, proudly. His name was Gary McGuire. ""Mostly rare and antique books from libraries and universities. They found a whole storage locker filled with books from floor to ceiling. Open and shut case.""
""Why did you take them?"" asked Shadow.
""I wanted them,"" said Gary.
""Jesus. Half a million dollars' worth of books.""
Gary flashed him a grin, lowered his voice and said, ""That was just in the storage locker they found. They never found the garage in San Clemente with the really good stuff in it.""
Gary had died in prison, when what the infirmary had told him was just a malingering, feeling-lousy kind of day turned out to be a ruptured appendix. Now, here in the Lakeside library, Shadow found himself thinking about a garage in San Clemente with box after box of rare, strange and beautiful books in it rotting away, all of them browning and wilting and being eaten by mold and insects in the darkness, waiting for someone who would never come to set them free.
Native American Beliefs and Traditions was on a single shelf in one castle-like turret. Shadow pulled down some books and sat in the window seat. In several minutes he had learned that thunderbirds were mythical gigantic birds who lived on mountaintops, who brought the lightning and who flapped their wings to make the thunder. There were some tribes, he read, who believed that the thunderbirds had made the world. Another half-hour's reading did not turn up anything more, and he could find no mention of eagle stones anywhere in the books' indexes.
Shadow was putting the last of the books back on the shelf when he became aware of somebody staring at him. Someone small and grave was peeking at him from around the heavy shelves. As he turned to look, the face vanished. He turned his back on the boy, then glanced around to see that he was being watched once more.
In his pocket was the Liberty dollar. He took it out of his pocket, held it up in his right hand, making sure the boy could see it. He finger-palmed it into his left hand, displayed both hands empty, raised his left hand to his mouth and coughed once, letting the coin tumble from his left hand into his right.
The boy looked at him wide-eyed and scampered away, returning a few moments later, dragging an unsmiling Marguerite Olsen, who looked at Shadow suspiciously and said, ""Hello, Mister Ainsel. Leon says you were doing magic for him.""
""Just a little prestidigitation, ma'am.""
""Please don't,"" she said.
""I'm sorry. I was just trying to entertain him.""
She shook her head, tautly. Drop it. Shadow dropped it. He said, ""I never did say thank you for your advice about heating the apartment. It's warm as toast in there right now.""
""That's good."" Her icy expression had not begun to thaw.
""It's a lovely library,"" said Shadow.
""It's a beautiful building. But the city needs something more efficient and less beautiful. You going to the library sale downstairs?""
""I wasn't planning on it.""
""Well, you should. It's for a good cause. Makes money for new books, cleans out shelf space, and it's raising money to put in computers for the children's section. But the sooner we get a whole new library built, the better.""
""I'll make a point of getting down there.""
""Head out into the hall and then go downstairs. Good seeing you, Mister Ainsel.""
""Call me Mike,"" he said.
She said nothing, just took Leon's hand and walked the boy over to the children's section.
""But, Mom,"" Shadow heard Leon say, ""it wasn't pressed igitation. It wasn't. I saw it vanish and then it fell out of his nose. I saw it.""
An oil portrait of Abraham Lincoln gazed down from the wall at him. Shadow walked down the marble and oak steps to the library basement, through a door into a large room filled with tables, each table covered with books of all kinds, indiscriminately assorted and promiscuously arranged: paperbacks and hardcovers, fiction and non-fiction, periodicals and encyclopedias all side by side upon the tables, spines up or spines out.
Shadow wandered to the back of the room where there was a table covered with old-looking leather-bound books, each with a library catalog number painted in white on the spine. ""You're the first person over in that corner all day,"" said the man sitting by the stack of empty boxes and bags and the small, open, metal cashbox. ""Mostly folk just take the thrillers and the children's books and the Harlequin Romances. Jenny Kerton, Danielle Steel, all that."" The man was reading Agatha Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. ""Everything on the tables is fifty cents a book, or you can take three for a dollar.""
Shadow thanked him and continued to browse. He found a copy of Herodotus's Histories bound in peeling brown leather. It made him think of the paperback copy he had left behind in prison. There was a book called Perplexing Parlour Illusions, which looked like it might have some coin effects. He carried both the books over to the man with the cashbox.
""Buy one more, it's still a dollar,"" said the man. ""And if you take another book away, you'll be doing us a favor. We need the shelf-space.""
Shadow walked back to the old leather-bound books. He decided to liberate the book that was least likely to be bought by anyone else, and found himself unable to decide between Common Diseases of the Urinary Tract with Illustrations by a Medical Doctor and Minutes of the Lakeside City Council 1872-1884. He looked at the illustrations in the medical book and decided that somewhere in the town there was a teenage boy who could use the book to gross out his friends. He took the Minutes to the man on the door, who took his dollar and put all the books into a Dave's Finest Food brown paper sack.
Shadow left the library. He had a clear view of the lake, all the way to the northeastern corner. He could even see his apartment building, a small brown box on the bank up past the bridge. And there were men on the ice near the bridge, four or five of them, pushing a dark green car into the center of the white lake.
""March the twenty-third,"" Shadow said to the lake, under his breath. ""Nine A.M. to nine twenty-five A.M."" He wondered if the lake or the klunker could hear him-and if they would pay any attention to him, even if they could. He doubted it. In Shadow's world, luck, the good kind, was something that other people had, not him.
The wind blew bitter against his face.
Officer Chad Mulligan was waiting outside Shadow's apartment when he got back. Shadow's heart began to pound when he saw the police car, to relax a little when he observed that the policeman was doing paperwork in the front seat.
He walked over to the car, carrying his paper sack of books.
Mulligan lowered his window. ""Library sale?"" he said.
""Yes.""
""I bought a box of Robert Ludlum books there two, three years back. Keep meaning to read them. My cousin swears by the guy. These days I figure if I ever get marooned on a desert island and I got my box of Robert Ludlum books with me, I can catch up on my reading.""
""Something particular I can do for you, Chief?""
""Not a damn thing, pal. Thought I'd stop by and see how you were settling in. You remember that Chinese saying, 'You save a man's life, you're responsible for him'? Well, I'm not saying I saved your life last week. But I still thought I should check in. How's the Gunther Purple-mobile doing?""
""Good,"" said Shadow. ""It's good. Running fine.""
""Pleased to hear it.""
""I saw my next-door neighbor in the library,"" said Shadow. ""Miz Olsen. I was wondering...""
""What crawled up her butt and died?""
""If you want to put it like that.""
""Long story. You want to ride along for a spell, and I'll tell you all about it.""
Shadow thought about it for a moment. ""Okay,"" he said. He got into the car, sat in the front passenger seat. Mulligan drove north of town. Then he turned off his lights and parked beside the road.
""Darren Olsen met Marge at UW Stevens Point and he brought her back north to Lakeside. She was a journalism major. He was studying, shit, hotel management, something like that. When they got here, jaws dropped. This was, what, thirteen, fourteen years ago. She was so beautiful...that black hair..."" He paused. ""Darren managed the Motel America over in Camden, twenty miles west of here. Except nobody ever seemed to want to stop in Camden and eventually the motel closed. They had two boys. At that time Sandy was eleven. The little one-Leon is it?-was just a babe in arms.
""Darren Olsen wasn't a brave man. He'd been a good high school football player, but that was the last time he was flying high. Whatever. He couldn't find the courage to tell Margie that he'd lost his job. So for a month, maybe for two months, he'd drive off early in the morning, come home late in the evening complaining about the hard day he'd had at the motel.""
""What was he doing?"" asked Shadow.
""Mm. Couldn't say for certain. I reckon he was driving up to Ironwood, maybe down to Green Bay. Guess he started out as a job hunter. Pretty soon he was drinking the time away, getting stoned, more than probably meeting the occasional working girl for a little instant gratification. He could have been gambling. What I do know for certain is that he emptied out their joint account in about ten weeks. It was only a matter of time before Margie figured out-there we go!""
He swung the car out, flicked on the siren and the lights, and scared the daylights out of a small man with Iowa plates who had just come down the hill at seventy.
The rogue Iowan ticketed, Mulligan returned to his story.
""Where was I? Okay. So Margie kicks him out, sues for divorce. It turned into a vicious custody battle. That's what they call 'em when they get into People magazine. Vicious Custody Battle. Always makes me think of lawyers with knives and assault weapons and brass knuckles. She got the kids. Darren got visitation rights and precious little else. Now, back then Leon was pretty small. Sandy was older, a good kid, the kind of boy who worships his daddy. Wouldn't let Margie say nothing bad about him. They lost the house-had a nice place down on Daniels Road. She moved into the apartments. He left town. Came back every few months to make everybody miserable.
""This went on for a few years. He'd come back, spend money on the kids, leave Margie in tears. Most of us just started wishing he'd never come back at all. His mom and pop had moved to Florida when they retired, said they couldn't take another Wisconsin winter. So last year he came out, said he wanted to take the boys to Florida for Christmas. Margie said not a hope, told him to get lost. It got pretty unpleasant-at one point I had to go over there. Domestic dispute. By the time I got there Darren was standing in the front yard shouting stuff, the boys were barely holding it together, Margie was crying.
""I told Darren he was shaping up for a night in the cells. I thought for a moment he was going to hit me, but he was sober enough not to do that. I gave him a ride down to the trailer park south of town, told him to shape up. That he'd hurt her enough...Next day he left town.""
""Two weeks later, Sandy vanished. Didn't get onto the school bus. Told his best friend that he'd be seeing his dad soon, that Darren was bringing him a specially cool present to make up for having missed Christmas in Florida. Nobody's seen him since. Non-custodial kidnappings are the hardest. It's tough to find a kid who doesn't want to be found, y'see?""
Shadow said that he did. He saw something else as well. Chad Mulligan was in love with Marguerite Olsen himself. He wondered if the man knew how obvious it was.
Mulligan pulled out once more, lights flashing, and pulled over some teenagers doing sixty. He didn't ticket them, ""just put the fear of God in them.""
  
That evening Shadow sat at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to transform a silver dollar into a penny. It was a trick he had found in Perplexing Parlour Illusions but the instructions were infuriating, unhelpful, and vague. Phrases like ""then vanish the penny in the usual way"" occurred every sentence or so. In this context, Shadow wondered, what was ""the usual way""? A French drop? Sleeving it? Shouting ""Oh my god, look out-a mountain lion!"" and dropping the coin into his side pocket while the audience's attention was diverted?
He tossed his silver dollar into the air, caught it, remembering the moon and the woman who gave it to him, then he attempted the illusion. It didn't seem to work. He walked into the bathroom and tried it in front of the mirror, and confirmed that he was right. The trick as written simply didn't work. He sighed, dropped the coins in his pocket and sat down on the couch. He spread the cheap throw rug over his legs and flipped open the Minutes of the Lakeside Council 1872-1884. The type, in two columns, was so small as to be almost unreadable. He flipped through the book, looking at the reproductions of the photographs of the period, at the several incarnations of the Lakeside city council therein: long side-whiskers and clay pipes and battered hats and shiny hats, worn with faces which were, many of them, peculiarly familiar. He was unsurprised to see that the portly secretary of the 1882 city council was a Patrick Mulligan: shave him, make him lose twenty pounds and he'd be a dead ringer for Chad Mulligan, his-what, great-great-grandson? He wondered if Hinzelmann's pioneer grandfather was in the photographs, but it did not appear that he had been city council material. Shadow thought he had seen a reference to a Hinzelmann in the text, while flipping from photograph to photograph, but it eluded him when he leafed back for it, and the tiny type made Shadow's eyes ache.
He put the book down on his chest and realized his head was nodding. It would be foolish to fall asleep on the couch, he decided, soberly. The bedroom was only a few feet away. On the other hand, the bedroom and the bed would still be there in five minutes, and anyway, he was not going to go to sleep, only to close his eyes for a moment...
Darkness roared.
He stood on an open plain. Beside him was the place from which he had once emerged, from which the earth had squeezed him. Stars were still falling from the sky and each star that touched the red earth became a man or a woman. The men had long black hair and high cheekbones. The women all looked like Marguerite Olsen. These were the star people.
They looked at him with dark, proud eyes.
""Tell me about the thunderbirds,"" said Shadow. ""Please. It's not for me. It's for my wife.""
One by one they turned their backs on him, and as he lost their faces they were gone, one with the landscape. But the last of them, her hair streaked white on dark gray, pointed before she turned away, pointed into the wine-colored sky.
""Ask them yourself,"" she said. Summer lightning flickered, momentarily illuminating the landscape from horizon to horizon.
There were high rocks near him, peaks and spires of sandstone, and Shadow began to climb the nearest. The spire was the color of old ivory. He grabbed at a handhold, and felt it slice into his hand. It's bone, thought Shadow. Not stone. It's old dry bone.
But it was a dream, and in dreams, sometimes, you have no choices: either there are no decisions to be made, or they were made for you long before ever the dream began. Shadow continued to climb, pulling himself up. His hands hurt. Bone popped and crushed and fragmented under his bare feet, cutting them painfully. The wind tugged at him, and he pressed himself to the spire, and he continued to climb the tower.
It was made of only one kind of bone, he realized, repeated over and over. Each of the bones was dry and ball-like. For a moment he had imagined they might be old yellow shells or the eggs of some dreadful bird. But another flare of lightning told him differently: they had holes for eyes, and they had teeth, which grinned without humor.
Somewhere birds were calling. Rain spattered his face.
He was hundreds of feet above the ground, clinging to the side of the tower of skulls, while flashes of lightning burned in the wings of the shadowy birds who circled the spire-enormous black, condor-like birds, each with a ruff of white at its neck. They were huge, graceful, awful birds, and the beats of their wings crashed like thunder on the night air.
They were circling the spire.
They must be fifteen, twenty feet from wingtip to wingtip, thought Shadow.
Then the first bird swung out of its glide toward him, blue lightning crackling in its wings. He pushed himself into a crevice of skulls, hollow eye-holes stared at him, a clutter of ivory teeth smiled at him, but he kept climbing, pulling himself up the mountain of skulls, every sharp edge cutting into his skin, feeling revulsion and terror and awe.
Another bird came at him, and one hand-sized talon sank into his arm.
He reached out and tried to grasp a feather from its wing. If he returned to his tribe without a thunderbird's feather he would be disgraced, he would never be a man, but the bird pulled up, so that he could not grasp even one feather. The thunderbird loosened its grip and swung back onto the wind. Shadow continued to climb.
There must be a thousand skulls, thought Shadow. A thousand thousand. And not all of them are human. He stood at last on the top of the spire, the great birds, the thunderbirds, circling him slowly, navigating the gusts of the storm with tiny flicks of their wings.
He heard a voice, the voice of the buffalo man, calling to him on the wind, telling him who the skulls belonged to...
The tower began to tumble, and the biggest bird, its eyes the blinding blue-white of forked lightning, plummeted down toward him in a rush of thunder, and Shadow was falling, tumbling down the tower of skulls...
The telephone shrilled. Shadow had not even known that it was connected. Groggy, shaken, he picked it up.
""What the fuck,"" shouted Wednesday, angrier than Shadow had ever heard him. ""What the almighty flying fuck do you think you are playing at?""
""I was asleep,"" said Shadow into the receiver, stupidly.
""What do you think is the fucking point of stashing you in a hiding place like Lakeside, if you're going to raise such a ruckus that not even a dead man could miss it?""
""I dreamed of thunderbirds...,"" said Shadow. ""And a tower. Skulls..."" It seemed to him very important to recount his dream.
""I know what you were dreaming. Everybody damn well knows what you were dreaming. Christ almighty. What's the point in hiding you, if you're going to start to fucking advertise?""
Shadow said nothing.
There was a pause at the other end of the telephone. ""I'll be there in the morning,"" said Wednesday. It sounded like the anger had died down. ""We're going to San Francisco. The flowers in your hair are optional."" And the line went dead.
Shadow put the telephone down on the carpet, and sat up, stiffly. It was six A.M. and still night-dark outside. He got up from the sofa, shivering. He could hear the wind as it screamed across the frozen lake. And he could hear somebody nearby, crying, only the thickness of a wall away. He was certain it was Marguerite Olsen, and her sobbing was insistent and low and heartbreaking.
Shadow walked into the bathroom and pissed, then went into his bedroom and closed the door, blocking off the sound of the crying woman. Outside the wind howled and wailed as if it, too, was seeking for a lost child, and he slept no more that night.
  
San Francisco in January was unseasonably warm, warm enough that the sweat prickled on the back of Shadow's neck. Wednesday was wearing a deep blue suit, and a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles that made him look like an entertainment lawyer.
They were walking along Haight Street. The street people and the hustlers and the moochers watched them go by, and no one shook a paper cup of change at them, no one asked them for anything at all.
Wednesday's jaw was set. Shadow had seen immediately that the man was still angry, and had asked no questions when the black Lincoln town car had pulled up outside the apartment that morning. They had not talked on the way to the airport. He had been relieved that Wednesday was in first class and he was back in coach.
Now it was late in the afternoon. Shadow, who had not been in San Francisco since he was a boy, who had only seen it since then as a background to movies, was astonished at how familiar it was, how colorful and unique the wooden houses, how steep the hills, how very much it didn't feel like anywhere else.
""It's almost hard to believe that this is in the same country as Lakeside,"" he said.
Wednesday glared at him. Then he said, ""It's not. San Francisco isn't in the same country as Lakeside any more than New Orleans is in the same country as New York or Miami is in the same country as Minneapolis.""
""Is that so?"" said Shadow, mildly.
""Indeed it is. They may share certain cultural signifiers-money, a federal government, entertainment; it's the same land, obviously-but the only things that give it the illusion of being one country are the green-back, The Tonight Show, and McDonald's."" They were approaching a park at the end of the road. ""Be nice to the lady we are visiting. But not too nice.""
""I'll be cool,"" said Shadow.
They stepped onto the grass.
A young girl, no older than fourteen, her hair dyed green and orange and pink, stared at them as they went by. She sat beside a dog, a mongrel, with a piece of string for a collar and a leash. She looked hungrier than the dog did. The dog yapped at them, then wagged its tail.
Shadow gave the girl a dollar bill. She stared at it as if she was not sure what it was. ""Buy dog food with it,"" Shadow suggested. She nodded, and smiled.
""Let me put it bluntly,"" said Wednesday. ""You must be very cautious around the lady we are visiting. She might take a fancy to you, and that would be bad.""
""Is she your girlfriend or something?""
""Not for all the little plastic toys in China,"" said Wednesday, agreeably. His anger seemed to have dissipated, or perhaps to have been invested for the future. Shadow suspected that anger was the engine that made Wednesday run.
There was a woman sitting on the grass, under a tree, with a paper tablecloth spread in front of her, and a variety of Tupperware dishes on the cloth.
She was-not fat, no, far from fat: what she was, a word that Shadow had never had cause to use until now, was curvaceous. Her hair was so fair that it was white, the kind of platinum-blonde tresses that should have belonged to a long-dead movie starlet, her lips were painted crimson, and she looked to be somewhere between twenty-five and fifty.
As they reached her she was selecting from a plate of deviled eggs. She looked up as Wednesday approached her, and put down the egg she had chosen, and wiped her hand. ""Hello, you old fraud,"" she said, but she smiled as she said it, and Wednesday bowed low, took her hand and raised it to his lips.
He said, ""You look divine.""
""How the hell else should I look?"" she demanded, sweetly. ""Anyway, you're a liar. New Orleans was such a mistake-I put on, what, thirty pounds there? I swear. I knew I had to leave when I started to waddle. The tops of my thighs rub together when I walk now, can you believe that?"" This last was addressed to Shadow. He had no idea what to say in reply, and felt a hot flush suffuse his face. The woman laughed delightedly. ""He's blushing! Wednesday my sweet, you brought me a blusher. How perfectly wonderful of you. What's he called?""
""This is Shadow,"" said Wednesday. He seemed to be enjoying Shadow's discomfort. ""Shadow, say hello to Easter.""
Shadow said something that might have been Hello, and the woman smiled at him again. He felt like he was caught in headlights-the blinding kind that poachers use to freeze deer before they shoot them. He could smell her perfume from where he was standing, an intoxicating mixture of jasmine and honeysuckle, of sweet milk and female skin.
""So, how's tricks?"" asked Wednesday.
The woman-Easter-laughed a deep and throaty laugh, full-bodied and joyous. How could you not like someone who laughed like that? ""Everything's fine,"" she said. ""How about you, you old wolf?""
""I was hoping to enlist your assistance.""
""Wasting your time.""
""At least hear me out before dismissing me.""
""No point. Don't even bother.""
She looked at Shadow. ""Please, sit down here and help yourself to some of this food. Here, take a plate and pile it high. It's all good. Eggs, roast chicken, chicken curry, chicken salad, and over here is lapin-rabbit, actually, but cold rabbit is a delight, and in that bowl over there is the jugged hare, well, why don't I just fill a plate for you?"" And she did, taking a plastic plate and piling it high with foods and passing it to him. Then she looked at Wednesday. ""Are you eating?"" she asked.
""I am at your disposal, my dear,"" said Wednesday.
""You,"" she told him, ""are so full of shit it's a wonder your eyes don't turn brown."" She passed him an empty plate. ""Help yourself,"" she said.
The afternoon sun at her back burned her hair into a platinum aura. ""Shadow,"" she said, chewing a chicken leg with gusto. ""That's a sweet name. Why do they call you Shadow?""
Shadow licked his lips to moisten them. ""When I was a kid,"" he said. ""We lived, my mother and I, we were, I mean, she was, well, like a secretary, at a bunch of U.S. embassies, we went from city to city all over Northern Europe. Then she got sick and had to take early retirement and we came back to the States. I never knew what to say to the other kids, so I'd just find adults and follow them around, not saying anything. I just needed the company, I guess. I don't know. I was a small kid.""
""You grew,"" she said.
""Yes,"" said Shadow. ""I grew.""
She turned back to Wednesday, who was spooning down a bowl of what looked like cold gumbo. ""Is this the boy who's got everybody so upset?""
""You heard?""
""I keep my ears pricked up,"" she said. Then to Shadow, ""You keep out of their way. There are too many secret societies out there, and they have no loyalties and no love. Commercial, independent, government, they're all in the same boat. They range from the barely competent to the deeply dangerous. Hey, old wolf, I heard a joke you'd like the other day. How do you know the CIA wasn't involved in the Kennedy assassination?""
""I've heard it,"" said Wednesday.
""Pity."" She turned her attention back to Shadow. ""But the spookshow, the ones you met, they're something else. They exist because everyone knows they must exist."" She drained a paper cup of something that looked like white wine, and then she got to her feet. ""Shadow's a good name,"" she said. ""I want a mochaccino. Come on.""
She began to walk away. ""What about the food?"" asked Wednesday. ""You can't just leave it here.""
She smiled at him, and pointed to the girl sitting by the dog, and then extended her arms to take in the Haight and the world. ""Let it feed them,"" she said, and she walked, with Wednesday and Shadow trailing behind her.
""Remember,"" she said to Wednesday, as they walked, ""I'm rich. I'm doing just peachy. Why should I help you?""
""You're one of us,"" he said. ""You're as forgotten and as unloved and unremembered as any of us. It's pretty clear whose side you should be on.""
They reached a sidewalk coffeehouse, went inside. There was only one waitress, who wore her eyebrow ring as a mark of caste, and a woman making coffee behind the counter. The waitress advanced upon them, smiling automatically, sat them down, took their orders.
Easter put her slim hand on the back of Wednesday's square gray hand. ""I'm telling you,"" she said, ""I'm doing fine. On my festival days they still feast on eggs and rabbits, on candy and on flesh, to represent rebirth and copulation. They wear flowers in their bonnets and they give each other flowers. They do it in my name. More and more of them every year. In my name, old wolf.""
""And you wax fat and affluent on their worship and their love?"" he said, dryly.
""Don't be an asshole."" Suddenly she sounded very tired. She sipped her mochaccino.
""Serious question, m'dear. Certainly I would agree that millions upon millions of them give each other tokens in your name, and that they still practice all the rites of your festival, even down to hunting for hidden eggs. But how many of them know who you are? Eh? Excuse me, miss?"" This to their waitress.
She said, ""You need another espresso?""
""No, my dear. I was just wondering if you could solve a little argument we were having over here. My friend and I were disagreeing over what the word 'Easter' means. Would you happen to know?""
The girl stared at him as if green toads had begun to push their way between his lips. Then she said, ""I don't know about any of that Christian stuff. I'm a pagan.""
The woman behind the counter said, ""I think it's like Latin or something for 'Christ has risen' maybe.""
""Really?"" said Wednesday.
""Yeah, sure,"" said the woman. ""Easter. Just like the sun rises in the east, you know.""
""The risen son. Of course-a most logical supposition."" The woman smiled and returned to her coffee grinder. Wednesday looked up at their waitress. ""I think I shall have another espresso, if you do not mind. And tell me, as a pagan, who do you worship?""
""Worship?""
""That's right. I imagine you must have a pretty wide-open field. So to whom do you set up your household altar? To whom do you bow down? To whom do you pray at dawn and at dusk?""
Her lips described several shapes without saying anything before she said, ""The female principle. It's an empowerment thing. You know.""
""Indeed. And this female principle of yours. Does she have a name?""
""She's the goddess within us all,"" said the girl with the eyebrow ring, color rising to her cheek. ""She doesn't need a name.""
""Ah,"" said Wednesday, with a wide monkey grin, ""so do you have mighty bacchanals in her honor? Do you drink blood wine under the full moon, while scarlet candles burn in silver candleholders? Do you step naked into the sea-foam, chanting ecstatically to your nameless goddess while the waves lick at your legs, lapping your thighs like the tongues of a thousand leopards?""
""You're making fun of me,"" she said. ""We don't do any of that stuff you were saying."" She took a deep breath. Shadow suspected she was counting to ten. ""Any more coffees here? Another mochaccino for you, ma'am?"" Her smile was a lot like the one she had greeted them with when they had entered.
They shook their heads, and the waitress turned to greet another customer.
""There,"" said Wednesday, ""is one who 'does not have the faith and will not have the fun.' Chesterton. Pagan indeed. So. Shall we go out onto the street, Easter my dear, and repeat the exercise? Find out how many passers-by know that their Easter festival takes its name from Eostre of the Dawn? Let's see-I have it. We shall ask a hundred people. For every one that knows the truth, you may cut off one of my fingers, and when I run out of them, toes; for every twenty who don't know you spend a night making love to me. And the odds are certainly in your favor here-this is San Francisco, after all. There are heathens and pagans and Wiccans aplenty on these precipitous streets.""
Her green eyes looked at Wednesday. They were, Shadow decided, the exact same color as a leaf in spring with the sun shining through it. She said nothing.
""We could try it,"" continued Wednesday. ""But I would end up with ten fingers, ten toes, and five nights in your bed. So don't tell me they worship you and keep your festival day. They mouth your name, but it has no meaning to them. Nothing at all.""
Tears stood out in her eyes. ""I know that,"" she said, quietly. ""I'm not a fool.""
""No,"" said Wednesday. ""You're not.""
He's pushed her too far, thought Shadow.
Wednesday looked down, ashamed. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. Shadow could hear the real sincerity in his voice. ""We need you. We need your energy. We need your power. Will you fight beside us when the storm comes?""
She hesitated. She had a chain of blue forget-me-nots tattooed around her left wrist.
""Yes,"" she said, after a while. ""I guess I will.""
Wednesday kissed his finger, touched it to her cheek. Then he called their waitress over and paid for their coffees, counting out the money carefully, folding it over with the check and presenting it to her.
As she walked away, Shadow said, ""Ma'am? Excuse me? I think you dropped this."" He picked up a ten-dollar bill from the floor.
""No,"" she said, looking at the wrapped bills in her hand.
""I saw it fall, ma'am,"" said Shadow, politely. ""You should count them.""
She counted the money in her hand, looked puzzled and said, ""Jesus. You're right. I'm sorry."" She took the ten-dollar bill from Shadow, and walked away.
Easter walked out onto the sidewalk with them. The light was just starting to fade. She nodded to Wednesday, then she touched Shadow's hand and said, ""What did you dream about, last night?""
""Thunderbirds,"" he said. ""A mountain of skulls.""
She nodded. ""And do you know whose skulls they were?""
""There was a voice,"" he said. ""In my dream. It told me.""
She nodded and waited.
He said, ""It said they were mine. Old skulls of mine. Thousands and thousands of them.""
She looked at Wednesday, and said, ""I think this one's a keeper."" She smiled her bright smile. Then she patted Shadow's arm and walked away down the sidewalk. He watched her go, trying-and failing-not to think of her thighs rubbing together as she walked.
In the taxi on the way to the airport, Wednesday turned to Shadow. ""What the hell was that business with the ten dollars about?""
""You shortchanged her. It comes out of her wages if she's short.""
""What the hell do you care?"" Wednesday seemed genuinely irate.
Shadow thought for a moment. Then he said, ""Well, I wouldn't want anyone to do it to me. She hadn't done anything wrong.""
""No?"" Wednesday stared off into the middle-distance, and said, ""When she was seven years old she shut a kitten in a closet. She listened to it mew for several days. When it ceased to mew, she took it out of the closet, put it into a shoebox, and buried it in the back yard. She wanted to bury something. She consistently steals from everywhere she works. Small amounts, usually. Last year she visited her grandmother in the nursing home to which the old woman is confined. She took an antique gold watch from her grandmother's bedside table, and then went prowling through several of the other rooms, stealing small quantities of money and personal effects from the twilight folk in their golden years. When she got home she did not know what to do with her spoils, scared someone would come after her, so she threw everything away except the cash.""
""I get the idea,"" said Shadow.
""She also has asymptomatic gonorrhea,"" said Wednesday. ""She suspects she might be infected but does nothing about it. When her last boyfriend accused her of having given him a disease she was hurt, offended, and refused to see him again.""
""This isn't necessary,"" said Shadow. ""I said I get the idea. You could do this to anyone, couldn't you? Tell me bad things about them.""
""Of course,"" agreed Wednesday. ""They all do the same things. They may think their sins are original, but for the most part they are petty and repetitive.""
""And that makes it okay for you to steal ten bucks from her?""
Wednesday paid the taxi and the two men walked into the airport, wandered up to their gate. Boarding had not yet begun. Wednesday said, ""What the hell else can I do? They don't sacrifice rams or bulls to me. They don't send me the souls of killers and slaves, gallows-hung and raven-picked. They made me. They forgot me. Now I take a little back from them. Isn't that fair?""
""My mom used to say, 'Life isn't fair,'"" said Shadow.
""Of course she did,"" said Wednesday. ""It's one of those things that moms say, right up there with 'If all your friends jumped off a cliff would you do it too?'""
""You stiffed that girl for ten bucks, I slipped her ten bucks,"" said Shadow, doggedly. ""It was the right thing to do, and I did it.""
Someone announced that their plane was boarding. Wednesday stood up. ""May your choices always be so clear,"" he said, and once again, he sounded totally sincere.
It's true what they say, thought Shadow. If you can fake sincerity, you've got it made.
  
The cold snap was easing when Wednesday dropped Shadow off, in the small hours of the morning. It was still obscenely cold in Lakeside, but it was no longer impossibly cold. The lighted sign on the side of the M&I Bank flashed alternately 3:30 A.M. and -5° F as they drove through the town.
It was 9:30 A.M. when Chief of Police Chad Mulligan knocked on the apartment door and asked Shadow if he knew a girl named Alison McGovern.
""I don't think so,"" said Shadow, sleepily.
""This is her picture,"" said Mulligan. It was a high school photograph. Shadow recognized the person in the picture immediately: the girl with the blue rubber-band braces on her teeth, the one who had been learning all about the oral uses of Alka-Seltzer from her friend.
""Oh yeah. Okay. She was on the bus when I came into town.""
""Where were you yesterday, Mister Ainsel?""
Shadow felt his world begin to spin away from him. He knew he had nothing to feel guilty about (You're a parole-violating felon living under an assumed name, whispered a calm voice in his mind. Isn't that enough?).
""San Francisco,"" he said. ""California. Helping my uncle transport a four-poster bed.""
""You got any way of proving it? Ticket stubs? Anything like that?""
""Sure."" He had both his boarding pass stubs in his back pocket, pulled them out. ""What's going on?""
Chad Mulligan examined the boarding passes. ""Alison McGovern's vanished. She helped out up at the Lakeside Humane Society. Feed animals, walk dogs. She'd come out for a few hours after school. One of those animal kids. So. Dolly Knopf, who runs the Humane Society, she'd always run her home when they closed up for the night. Yesterday Alison never got there.""
""She's vanished.""
""Yup. Her parents called us last night. Silly kid used to hitchhike up to the Humane Society. It's out on County W, pretty isolated. Her parents told her not to, but this isn't the kind of place where things happen...people here don't lock their doors, you know? And you can't tell kids. So, look at the photo again.""
Alison McGovern was smiling. The rubber bands on her teeth in the photograph were red, not blue.
""You can honestly say you didn't kidnap her, rape her, murder her, anything like that?""
""I was in San Francisco. And I wouldn't do that shit.""
""That was what I figured, pal. So you want to come help us look for her?""
""Me?""
""You. We've had the K-9 guys out this morning-nothing so far."" He sighed. ""Heck, Mike. I just hope she turns up in the Twin Cities with some dopey boyfriend.""
""You think it's likely?""
""I think it's possible. You want to join the hunting party?""
Shadow remembered seeing the girl in Henning's Farm and Home Supplies, the flash of a shy blue-braced smile, how beautiful he had known she was going to be one day. ""I'll come,"" he said.
There were two dozen men and women waiting in the lobby of the fire station. Shadow recognized Hinzelmann, and several other faces looked familiar. There were several police officers, dressed in blue, and some men and women from the Lumber County sheriff's department, dressed in brown.
Chad Mulligan told them what Alison was wearing when she vanished (a scarlet snowsuit, green gloves, blue woolen hat under the hood of her snowsuit) and divided the volunteers into groups of three. Shadow, Hinzelmann, and a man named Brogan comprised one of the groups. They were reminded how short the daylight period was, told that if, god forbid, they found Alison's body they were not repeat not to disturb anything, just to radio back for help, but that if she was alive they were to keep her warm until help came.
They were dropped off out on County W.
Hinzelmann, Brogan and Shadow walked along the edge of a frozen creek. Each group of three had been issued a small hand-held walkie-talkie before they left.
The cloud cover was low, and the world was gray. No snow had fallen in the last thirty-six hours. Footprints stood out in the glittering crust of the crisp snow.
Brogan looked like a retired army colonel, with his slim moustache and white temples. He drove them, told Shadow he was a retired high school principal. ""I took early retirement when I saw I wasn't getting any younger. These days I still teach a little, do the school play-that was always the high point of the year anyhow-and now I hunt a little and have a cabin down on Pike Lake, spend too much time there."" As they set out Brogan said, ""On the one hand, I hope we find her. On the other, if she's going to be found, I'd be very grateful if it was someone else who got to find her, and not us. You know what I mean?""
Shadow knew exactly what he meant.
The three men did not talk much. They walked, looking for a red snowsuit, or green gloves, or a blue hat, or a white body. Now and again Brogan, who had the walkie-talkie, would check in with Chad Mulligan.
At lunchtime they sat with the rest of the search party on a commandeered school bus and ate hot dogs and drank hot soup. Someone pointed out a red-tailed hawk in a bare tree, and someone else said that it looked more like a falcon, but it flew away and the argument was abandoned.
Hinzelmann told them a story about his grandfather's trumpet, and how he tried playing it during a cold snap, and the weather was so cold outside by the barn, where his grandfather had gone to practice, that no music came out.
""Then after he came inside he put the trumpet down by the wood-stove to thaw. Well, the family're all in bed that night and suddenly the unfrozen tunes start coming out of that trumpet. Scared my grandmother so much she nearly had kittens.""
The afternoon was endless, unfruitful, and depressing. The daylight faded slowly: distances collapsed and the world turned indigo and the wind blew cold enough to burn the skin on your face. When it was too dark to continue, Mulligan radioed to them to call it off for the evening, and they were picked up and driven back to the fire station.
In the block next to the fire station was the Buck Stops Here Tavern, and that was where most of the searchers wound up. They were exhausted and dispirited, talking to each other of the bald eagle that had circled them, how cold it had become, how more than likely Alison would show up in a day or so, no idea of how much trouble she'd caused everyone.
""You shouldn't think badly of the town because of this,"" said Brogan. ""It is a good town.""
""Lakeside,"" said a trim woman whose name Shadow had forgotten, if ever they'd been introduced, ""is the best town in the Northwoods. You know how many people are unemployed in Lakeside?""
""No,"" said Shadow.
""Less than twenty,"" she said. ""There's over five thousand people live in and around this town. We may not be rich, but everyone's working. It's not like the mining towns up in the northeast-most of them are ghost towns now. There were farming towns that were killed by the falling cost of milk, or the low price of hogs. You know what the biggest cause of unnatural death is among farmers in the Midwest?""
""Suicide?"" Shadow hazarded.
She looked almost disappointed. ""Yeah. That's it. They kill themselves."" She shook her head. Then she continued, ""There are too many towns hereabouts that only exist for the hunters and the vacationers, towns that just take their money and send them home with their trophies and their bug bites. Then there are the company towns, where everything's just hunky-dory until Wal-Mart relocates their distribution center or 3M stops manufacturing CD cases there or whatever and suddenly there's a boatload of folks who can't pay their mortgages. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.""
""Ainsel,"" said Shadow. ""Mike Ainsel."" The beer he was drinking was a local brew, made with spring water. It was good.
""I'm Callie Knopf,"" she said. ""Dolly's sister."" Her face was still ruddy from the cold. ""So what I'm saying is that Lakeside's lucky. We've got a little of everything here-farm, light industry, tourism, crafts. Good schools.""
Shadow looked at her in puzzlement. There was something empty at the bottom of all her words. It was as if he were listening to a salesman, a good salesman, who believed in his product, but still wanted to make sure you went home with all the brushes or the full set of encyclopedias. Perhaps she could see it in his face. She said, ""I'm sorry. When you love something you just don't want to stop talking about it. What do you do, Mister Ainsel?""
""Heavy lifting,"" said Shadow. ""My uncle buys and sells antiques all over the country. He uses me to move big, heavy things. Without breaking them too badly. It's a good job, but not steady work."" A black cat, the bar mascot, wound between Shadow's legs, rubbing its forehead on his boot. It leapt up beside him onto the bench and went to sleep.
""At least you get to travel,"" said Brogan. ""You do anything else?""
""You got eight quarters on you?"" asked Shadow. Brogan fumbled for his change. He found five quarters, pushed them across the table to Shadow. Callie Knopf produced another three quarters.
He laid out the coins, four in each row. Then, with scarcely a fumble, he did the Coins Through the Table, appearing to drop half the coins through the wood of the table, from his left hand into his right.
After that, he took all eight coins in his right hand, an empty water glass in his left, covered the glass with a napkin and appeared to make the coins vanish one by one from his right hand and land in the glass beneath the napkin with an audible clink. Finally, he opened his right hand to show it was empty, then swept the napkin away to show the coins in the glass.
He returned their coins-three to Callie, five to Brogan-then took a quarter back from Brogan's hand, leaving four coins. He blew on it, and it was a penny, which he gave to Brogan, who counted his quarters and was dumbfounded to find that he still had all five in his hand.
""You're a Houdini,"" cackled Hinzelmann in delight. ""That's what you are!""
""Just an amateur,"" said Shadow. ""I've got a long way to go."" Still, he felt a smidgen of pride. It had, he realized, been his first adult audience.
He stopped at the food store on the way home to buy a carton of milk. The ginger-haired girl on the checkout counter looked familiar, and her eyes were red-rimmed from crying. Her face was one big freckle.
""I know you,"" said Shadow. ""You're-"" And he was about to say the Alka-Seltzer girl, but bit it back and finished, ""You're Alison's friend. From the bus. I hope she's going to be okay.""
She sniffed and nodded. ""Me too."" She blew her nose on a tissue, hard, and pushed it back into her sleeve.
Her badge said HI! I'M SOPHIE! ASK ME HOW YOU CAN LOSE 20 LBS. IN 30 DAYS!
""I spent today looking for her. No luck yet.""
Sophie nodded, blinked back tears. She waved the milk carton in front of a scanner and it chirped its price at them. Shadow passed her two dollars.
""I'm leaving this fucking town,"" said the girl in a sudden, choked voice. ""I'm going to live with my mom in Ashland. Alison's gone. Sandy Olsen went last year. Jo Ming the year before that. What if it's me next year?""
""I thought Sandy Olsen was taken by his father.""
""Yes,"" said the girl, bitterly. ""I'm sure he was. And Jo Ming went out to California, and Sarah Lindquist got lost on a trail hike and they never found her. Whatever. I want to go to Ashland.""
She took a deep breath and held it for a moment. Then she smiled at him. There was nothing insincere about that smile. It was just the smile of someone who knew that it was her job to smile when she gave someone their change, and as she put Shadow's change and receipt into his hand she told him to have a nice day. Then she turned to the woman with the full shopping cart behind him and began to unload-and-scan. A boy no older than Sophie sauntered over to bag the groceries.
Shadow took his milk and drove away, past the gas station and the klunker on the ice, and over the bridge and home.

Coming to America 1778 
There was a girl, and her uncle sold her, wrote Mr. Ibis in his perfect copperplate handwriting.
That is the tale; the rest is detail.
There are stories that are true, in which each individual's tale is unique and tragic, and the worst of the tragedy is that we have heard it before, and we cannot allow ourselves to feel it too deeply. We build a shell around it like an oyster dealing with a painful particle of grit, coating it with smooth pearl layers in order to cope. This is how we walk and talk and function, day in, day out, immune to others' pain and loss. If it were to touch us it would cripple us or make saints of us; but, for the most part, it does not touch us. We cannot allow it to.
Tonight, as you eat, reflect if you can: there are children starving in the world, starving in numbers larger than the mind can easily hold, up in the big numbers where an error of a million here, a million there, can be forgiven. It may be uncomfortable for you to reflect upon this or it may not, but still, you will eat.
There are accounts which, if we open our hearts to them, will cut us too deeply. Look-here is a good man, good by his own lights and the lights of his friends: he is faithful and true to his wife, he adores and lavishes attention on his little children, he cares about his country, he does his job punctiliously, as best he can. So, efficiently and good-naturedly, he exterminates Jews: he appreciates the music that plays in the background to pacify them; he advises the Jews not to forget their identification numbers as they go into the showers-many people, he tells them, forget their numbers, and take the wrong clothes, when they come out of the showers. This calms the Jews: there will be life, they assure themselves, after the showers. And they are wrong. Our man supervises the detail taking the bodies to the ovens; and if there is anything he feels bad about, it is that he still allows the gassing of vermin to affect him. Were he a truly good man, he knows, he would feel nothing but joy, as the earth is cleansed of its pests.
Leave him; he cuts too deep. He is too close to us and it hurts.
There was a girl, and her uncle sold her. Put like that it seems so simple.
No man, proclaimed Donne, is an Island, and he was wrong. If we were not islands, we would be lost, drowned in each others' tragedies. We are insulated (a word that means, literally, remember, made into an island) from the tragedy of others, by our island nature, and by the repetitive shape and form of the stories. We know the shape, and the shape does not change. There was a human being who was born, lived, and then, by some means or other, died. There. You may fill in the details from your own experience. As unoriginal as any other tale, as unique as any other life. Lives are snowflakes-unique in detail, forming patterns we have seen before, but as like one another as peas in a pod (and have you ever looked at peas in a pod? I mean, really looked at them? There's not a chance you'd mistake one for another, after a minute's close inspection.)
We need individual stories. Without individuals we see only numbers: a thousand dead, a hundred thousand dead, ""casualties may rise to a million."" With individual stories, the statistics become people-but even that is a lie, for the people continue to suffer in numbers that themselves are numbing and meaningless. Look, see the child's swollen, swollen belly, and the flies that crawl at the corners of his eyes, his skeletal limbs: will it make it easier for you to know his name, his age, his dreams, his fears? To see him from the inside? And if it does, are we not doing a disservice to his sister, who lies in the searing dust beside him, a distorted, distended caricature of a human child? And there, if we feel for them, are they now more important to us than a thousand other children touched by the same famine, a thousand other young lives who will soon be food for the flies' own myriad squirming children?
We draw our lines around these moments of pain, and remain upon our islands, and they cannot hurt us. They are covered with a smooth, safe, nacreous layer to let them slip, pearl-like, from our souls without real pain.
Fiction allows us to slide into these other heads, these other places, and look out through other eyes. And then in the tale we stop before we die, or we die vicariously and unharmed, and in the world beyond the tale we turn the page or close the book, and we resume our lives.
A life, which is, like any other, unlike any other.
And the simple truth is this: there was a girl and her uncle sold her.
This is what they used to say, where the girl came from: no man may be certain who fathered a child, but the mother, ah, that you could be certain of. Lineage and property was something that moved in the matrilineal line, but power remained in the hands of the men: a man had complete ownership of his sister's children.
There was a war in that place, and it was a small war, no more than a skirmish between the men of two rival villages. It was almost an argument. One village won the argument, one village lost it.
Life as a commodity, people as possessions. Enslavement had been part of the culture of those parts for thousands of years. The Arab slavers had destroyed the last of the great kingdoms of East Africa, while the West African nations had destroyed each other.
There was nothing untoward or unusual about their uncle selling the twins, although twins were considered magical beings, and their uncle was scared of them, scared enough that he did not tell them that they were to be sold in case they harmed his shadow and killed him. They were twelve years old. She was called Wututu, the messenger bird; he was called Agasu, the name of a dead king. They were healthy children, and, because they were twins, male and female, they were told many things about the gods, and because they were twins they listened to the things that they were told, and they remembered.
Their uncle was a fat and lazy man. If he had owned more cattle, perhaps he would have given up one of his cattle instead of the children, but he did not. He sold the twins. Enough of him: he shall not enter further into this narrative. We follow the twins.
They were marched, with several other slaves taken or sold in the war, for a dozen miles to a small outpost. Here they were traded, and the twins, along with thirteen others, were bought by six men with spears and knives who marched them to the west, toward the sea, and then for many miles along the coast. There were fifteen slaves now altogether, their hands loosely bound, tied neck to neck.
Wututu asked her brother Agasu what would happen to them.
""I do not know,"" he said. Agasu was a boy who smiled often: his teeth were white and perfect, and he showed them as he grinned, his happy smiles making Wututu happy in her turn. He was not smiling now. Instead he tried to show bravery for his sister, his head back and shoulders spread, as proud, as menacing, as comical as a puppy with its hackles raised.
The man in the line behind Wututu, his cheeks scarred, said, ""They will sell us to the white devils, who will take us to their home across the water.""
""And what will they do to us there?"" demanded Wututu.
The man said nothing.
""Well?"" asked Wututu. Agasu tried to dart a glance over his shoulder. They were not allowed to talk or sing as they walked.
""It is possible they will eat us,"" said the man. ""That is what I have been told. That is why they need so many slaves. It is because they are always hungry.""
Wututu began to cry as she walked. Agasu said, ""Do not cry, my sister. They will not eat you. I shall protect you. Our gods will protect you.""
But Wututu continued to cry, walking with a heavy heart, feeling pain and anger and fear as only a child can feel it: raw and overwhelming. She was unable to tell Agasu that she was not worried about the white devils eating her. She would survive, she was certain of it. She cried because she was scared that they would eat her brother, and she was not certain that she could protect him.
They reached a trading post, and they were kept there for ten days. In the morning of the tenth day they were taken from the hut in which they had been imprisoned (it had become very crowded in the final days, as men arrived from far away, some of them from hundreds of miles, bringing their own strings and skeins of slaves). They were marched to the harbor, and Wututu saw the ship that was to take them away.
Her first thought was how big a ship it was, her second that it was too small for all of them to fit inside. It sat lightly on the water. The ship's boat came back and forth, ferrying the captives to the ship where they were manacled and arranged in low decks by sailors, some of whom were brick-red or tan skinned, with strange pointy noses and beards that made them look like beasts. Several of the sailors looked like her own people, like the men who had marched her to the coast. The men and the women and the children were separated, forced into different areas on the slave deck. There were too many slaves for the ship to hold easily, so another dozen men were chained up on the deck in the open, beneath the places where the crew would sling their hammocks.
Wututu was put in with the children, not with the women; and she was not chained, merely locked in. Agasu, her brother, was forced in with the men, in chains, packed like herrings. It stank under that deck, although the crew had scrubbed it down since their last cargo. It was a stink that had entered the wood: the smell of fear and bile and diarrhea and death, of fever and madness and hate. Wututu sat in the hot hold with the other children. She could feel the children on each side of her sweating. A wave tumbled a small boy into her, hard, and he apologized in a tongue that Wututu did not recognize. She tried to smile at him in the semi-darkness.
The ship set sail. Now it rode heavy in the water.
Wututu wondered about the place the white men came from (although none of them were truly white: sea-burned and sunburned they were, and their skins were dark). Were they so short of food that they had to send all the way to her land for people to eat? Or was it that she was to be a delicacy, a rare treat for a people who had eaten so many things that only black-skinned flesh in their cook pots made their mouths water?
On the second day out of port the ship hit a squall, not a bad one, but the ship's decks lurched and tumbled, and the smell of vomit joined the mixed smells of urine and liquid feces and fear-sweat. Rain poured down on them in bucketloads from the air gratings set in the ceiling of the slave deck.
A week into the voyage, and well out of sight of land, the slaves were allowed out of irons. They were warned that any disobedience, any trouble, and they would be punished more than they had ever imagined.
In the morning the captives were fed beans and ship's biscuits, and a mouthful each of vinegared lime juice, harsh enough that their faces would twist, and they would cough and splutter, and some of them would moan and wail as the lime juice was spooned out. They could not spit it out, though: if they were caught spitting or dribbling it out they were lashed or beaten.
The night brought them salted beef. It tasted unpleasant, and there was a rainbow sheen to the gray surface of the meat. That was at the start of the voyage. As the voyage continued, the meat grew worse.
When they could, Wututu and Agasu would huddle together, talking of their mother and their home and their playfellows. Sometimes Wututu would tell Agasu the stories their mother had told them, like those of Elegba, the trickiest of the gods, who was Great Mawu's eyes and ears in the world, who took messages to Mawu and brought back Mawu's replies.
In the evenings, to while away the monotony of the voyage, the sailors would make the slaves sing for them and dance the dances of their native lands.
Wututu was lucky that she had been put in with the children. The children were packed in tightly and ignored; the women were not always so fortunate. On some slave ships the female slaves were raped repeatedly and continually by the crew, simply as an unspoken perquisite of the voyage. This was not one of those ships, which is not to say that there were no rapes.
A hundred men, women and children died on that voyage and were dropped over the side; and some of the captives who were dropped over the side had not yet died, but the green chill of the ocean cooled their final fever and they went down flailing, choking, lost.
Wututu and Agasu were traveling on a Dutch ship, but they did not know this, and it might as easily have been British, or Portuguese, or Spanish, or French.
The black crewmen on the ship, their skins even darker than Wututu's, told the captives where to go, what to do, when to dance. One morning Wututu caught one of the black guards staring at her. When she was eating, the man came over to her and stared down at her, without saying anything.
""Why do you do this?"" she asked the man. ""Why do you serve the white devils?""
He grinned at her as if her question was the funniest thing he ever had heard. Then he leaned over, so his lips were almost brushing her ears, so his hot breath on her ear made her suddenly feel sick. ""If you were older,"" he told her, ""I would make you scream with happiness from my penis. Perhaps I will do it tonight. I have seen how well you dance.""
She looked at him with her nut-brown eyes and she said, unflinching, smiling even, ""If you put it in me down there I will bite it off with my teeth down there. I am a witch girl, and I have very sharp teeth down there."" She took pleasure in watching his expression change. He said nothing and walked away.
The words had come out of her mouth, but they had not been her words: she had not thought them or made them. No, she realized, those were the words of Elegba the trickster. Mawu had made the world and then, thanks to Elegba's trickery, had lost interest in it. It was Elegba of the clever ways and the iron-hard erection who had spoken through her, who had ridden her for a moment, and that night before she slept she gave thanks to Elegba.
Several of the captives refused to eat. They were whipped until they put food into their mouths and swallowed, although the whipping was severe enough that two men died of it. Still, no one else on the ship tried to starve themselves to freedom. A man and a woman tried to kill themselves by leaping over the side. The woman succeeded. The man was rescued and he was tied to the mast and lashed for the better part of a day, until his back ran with blood, and he was left there as the day became night. He was given no food to eat, and nothing to drink but his own piss. By the third day he was raving, and his head had swollen and grown soft, like an old melon. When he stopped raving they threw him over the side. Also, for five days following the escape attempt the captives were returned to their manacles and chains.
It was a long journey and a bad one for the captives, and it was not pleasant for the crew, although they had learned to harden their hearts to the business, and pretended to themselves that they were no more than farmers, taking their livestock to the market.
They made harbor on a pleasant, balmy day in Bridgetown, Barbados, and the captives were carried from the ship to the shore in low boats sent out from the dock, and taken to the market square, where they were, by dint of a certain amount of shouting, and blows from cudgels, arranged into lines. A whistle blew, and the market square filled with men, poking, prodding, red-faced men, shouting, inspecting, calling, appraising, grumbling.
Wututu and Agasu were separated then. It happened so fast-a big man forced open Agasu's mouth, looked at his teeth, felt his arm muscles, nodded, and two other men hauled Agasu away. He did not fight them. He looked at Wututu and called ""Be brave,"" to her. She nodded, and then her vision smeared and blurred with tears, and she wailed. Together they were twins, magical, powerful. Apart they were two children in pain.
She never saw him again but once, and never in life.
This is what happened to Agasu. First they took him to a seasoning farm, where they whipped him daily for the things he did and didn't do, they taught him a smattering of English and they gave him the name of Inky Jack, for the darkness of his skin. When he ran away they hunted him down with dogs and brought him back, and cut off a toe with a chisel, to teach him a lesson he would not forget. He would have starved himself to death, but when he refused to eat his front teeth were broken and thin gruel was forced into his mouth, until he had no choice but to swallow or to choke.
Even in those times they preferred slaves born into captivity to those brought over from Africa. The free-born slaves tried to run, or they tried to die, and either way, there went the profits.
When Inky Jack was sixteen he was sold, with several other slaves, to a sugar plantation on St. Domingue. They called him Hyacinth, the big, broken-toothed slave. He met an old woman from his own village on that plantation-she had been a house slave before her fingers became too gnarled and arthritic-who told him that the whites intentionally split up captives from the same towns and villages and regions, to avoid insurrection and revolts. They did not like it when slaves spoke to each other in their own languages.
Hyacinth learned some French, and was taught a few of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Each day he cut sugar cane from well before the sun rose until after the sun had set.
He fathered several children. He went with the other slaves, in the small hours of the night, to the woods, although it was forbidden, to dance the Calinda, to sing to Damballa-Wedo, the serpent god, in the form of a black snake. He sang to Elegba, to Ogu, Shango, Zaka, and to many others, all the gods the captives had brought with them to the island, brought in their minds and their secret hearts.
The slaves on the sugar plantations of St. Domingue rarely lived more than a decade. The free time they were given-two hours in the heat of noon, and five hours in the dark of the night (from eleven until four)-was also the only time they had to grow and tend the food they would eat (for they were not fed by their masters, merely given small plots of land to cultivate, with which to feed themselves), and it was also the time they had to sleep and to dream. Even so, they would take that time and they would gather and dance, and sing and worship. The soil of St. Domingue was a fertile soil and the gods of Dahomey and the Congo and the Niger put down thick roots there and grew lush and huge and deep, and they promised freedom to those who worshiped them at night in the groves.
Hyacinth was twenty-five years of age when a spider bit the back of his right hand. The bite became infected and the flesh on the back of his hand was necrotic: soon enough his whole arm was swollen and purple, and the hand stank. It throbbed and it burned.
They gave him crude rum to drink, and they heated the blade of a machete in the fire until it glowed red and white. They cut his arm off at the shoulder with a saw, and they cauterized it with the burning blade. He lay in a fever for a week. Then he returned to work.
The one-armed slave called Hyacinth took part in the slave revolt of 1791.
Elegba himself took possession of Hyacinth in the grove, riding him as a white man rode a horse, and spoke through him. He remembered little of what was said, but the others who were with him told him that he had promised them freedom from their captivity. He remembered only his erection, rod-like and painful; and raising both hands-the one he had, and the one he no longer possessed-to the moon.
A pig was killed, and the men and the women of that plantation drank the hot blood of the pig, pledging themselves and binding themselves into a brotherhood. They swore that they were an army of freedom, pledged themselves once more to the gods of all the lands from which they had been dragged as plunder.
""If we die in battle with the whites,"" they told each other, ""we will be reborn in Africa, in our homes, in our own tribes.""
There was another Hyacinth in the uprising, so they now called Agasu by the name of Big One-Arm. He fought, he worshiped, he sacrificed, he planned. He saw his friends and his lovers killed, and he kept fighting.
They fought for twelve years, a maddening, bloody struggle with the plantation owners, with the troops brought over from France. They fought, and they kept fighting, and, impossibly, they won.
On January the first, 1804, the independence of St. Domingue, soon to be known to the world as the Republic of Haiti, was declared. Big One-Arm did not live to see it. He had died in August 1802, bayoneted by a French soldier.
At the precise moment of the death of Big One-Arm (who had once been called Hyacinth, and before that, Inky Jack, and who was forever in his heart Agasu), his sister, whom he had known as Wututu, who had been called Mary on her first plantation in the Carolinas, and Daisy when she had become a house slave, and Sukey when she was sold to the Lavere family down the river in New Orleans, felt the cold bayonet slide between her ribs and started to scream and weep uncontrollably. Her twin daughters woke and began to howl. They were cream-and-coffee colored, her new babies, not like the black children she had borne when she was on the plantation and little more than a girl herself-children she had not seen since they were fifteen and ten years old. The middle girl had been dead for a year, when she was sold away from them.
Sukey had been whipped many times since she had come ashore-once, salt had been rubbed into the wounds, on another occasion she had been whipped so hard and for so long that she could not sit, or allow anything to touch her back, for several days. She had been raped several times when younger: by black men who had been ordered to share her wooden palette, and by white men. She had been chained. She had not wept then, though. Since her brother had been taken from her she had only wept once. It was in North Carolina, when she had seen the food for the slave children and the dogs poured into the same trough, and she had seen her little children scrabbling with the dogs for the scraps. She saw that happen one day-and she had seen it before, every day on that plantation, and she would see it again many times before she left-she saw it that one day and it broke her heart.
She had been beautiful for a while. Then the years of pain had taken their toll, and she was no longer beautiful. Her face was lined, and there was too much pain in those brown eyes.
Eleven years earlier, when she was twenty-five, her right arm had withered. None of the white folk had known what to make of it. The flesh seemed to melt from the bones, and now her right arm hung by her side, little more than a skeletal arm covered in skin, and almost immobile. After this she had become a house-slave.
The Casterton family, who had owned the plantation, were impressed by her cooking and house skills, but Mrs. Casterton found the withered arm unsettling, and so she was sold to the Lavere family, who were out for a year from Louisiana: M. Lavere was a fat, cheerful man, who was in need of a cook and a maid of all work, and who was not in the slightest repulsed by the slave Daisy's withered arm. When, a year later, they returned to Louisiana, slave Sukey went with them.
In New Orleans the women came to her, and the men also, to buy cures and love charms and little fetishes, black folks, yes, of course, but white folks too. The Lavere family turned a blind eye to it. Perhaps they enjoyed the prestige of having a slave who was feared and respected. They would not, however, sell her her freedom.
Sukey went into the bayou late at night, and she danced the Calinda and the Bamboula. Like the dancers of St. Domingue and the dancers of her native land, the dancers in the bayou had a black snake as their voudon; even so, the gods of her homeland and of the other African nations did not possess her people as they had possessed her brother and the folk of St. Domingue. She would still invoke them and call their names, to beg them for favors.
She listened when the white folk spoke of the revolt in St. Domingo (as they called it), and how it was doomed to fail-""Think of it! A cannibal land!""-and then she observed that they no longer spoke of it.
Soon, it seemed to her that they pretended that there never had been a place called St. Domingo, and as for Haiti, the word was never mentioned. It was as if the whole American nation had decided that they could, by an effort of belief, command a good-sized Caribbean island to no longer exist merely by willing it so.
A generation of Lavere children grew up under Sukey's watchful eye. The youngest, unable to say ""Sukey"" as a child, had called her Mama Zouzou, and the name had stuck. Now the year was 1821, and Sukey was in her mid-fifties. She looked much older.
She knew more of the secrets than old Sanité Dédé, who sold candies in front of the Cabildo, more than Marie Saloppé, who called herself the voodoo queen: both were free women of color, while Mama Zouzou was a slave, and would die a slave, or so her master had said.
The young woman who came to her to find what had happened to her husband styled herself the Widow Paris. She was high-breasted and young and proud. She had African blood in her, and European blood, and Indian blood. Her skin was reddish, her hair was a gleaming black. Her eyes were black and haughty. Her husband, Jacques Paris, was, perhaps, dead. He was three-quarters white as these things were calculated, and the bastard of a once-proud family, one of the many immigrants who had fled from St. Domingo, and as freeborn as his striking young wife.
""My Jacques. Is he dead?"" asked the Widow Paris. She was a hair-dresser who went from home to home, arranging the coiffures of the elegant ladies of New Orleans before their demanding social engagements.
Mama Zouzou consulted the bones, then shook her head. ""He is with a white woman, somewhere north of here,"" she said. ""A white woman with golden hair. He is alive."" This was not magic. It was common knowledge in New Orleans just with whom Jacques Paris had run off, and the color of her hair.
Mama Zouzou was surprised to realize that the Widow Paris did not already know that Jacques was sticking his quadroon little pipi into a pink-skinned girl up in Colfax every night. Well, on the nights that he was not so drunk he could use it for nothing better than pissing. Perhaps she did know. Perhaps she had another reason for coming.
The Widow Paris came to see the old slave woman one or two times a week. After a month she brought gifts for the old woman: hair ribbons, and a seed-cake, and a black rooster.
""Mama Zouzou,"" said the girl, ""it is time for you to teach me what you know.""
""Yes,"" said Mama Zouzou, who knew which way the wind blew. And besides, the Widow Paris had confessed that she had been born with webbed toes, which meant that she was a twin and she had killed her twin in the womb. What choice did Mama Zouzou have?
She taught the girl that two nutmegs hung upon a string around the neck until the string breaks will cure heart murmurs, while a pigeon that has never flown, cut open and laid on the patient's head, will draw a fever. She showed her how to make a wishing bag, a small leather bag containing thirteen pennies, nine cotton seeds and the bristles of a black hog, and how to rub the bag to make wishes come true.
The Widow Paris learned everything that Mama Zouzou told her. She had no real interest in the gods, though. Not really. Her interests were in the practicalities. She was delighted to learn that if you dip a live frog in honey and place it in an ants' nest, then, when the bones are cleaned and white, a close examination will reveal a flat, heart-shaped bone, and another with a hook on it: the bone with the hook on it must be hooked onto the garment of the one you wish to love you, while the heart-shaped bone must be kept safely (for if it is lost, your loved one will turn on you like an angry dog). Infallibly, if you do this, the one you love will be yours.
She learned that dried snake powder, placed in the face powder of an enemy, will produce blindness, and that an enemy can be made to drown herself by taking a piece of her underwear, turning it inside out, and burying it at midnight under a brick.
Mama Zouzou showed the Widow Paris the World Wonder Root, the great and the little roots of John the Conqueror, she showed her dragon's blood, and valerian and five-finger grass. She showed her how to brew waste-away tea, and follow-me water and faire-Shingo water.
All these things and more Mama Zouzou showed the Widow Paris. Still, it was disappointing for the old woman. She did her best to teach her the hidden truths, the deep knowledge, to tell her of Elegba, of Mawu, of Aido-Hwedo the voudon serpent, and the rest, but the Widow Paris (I shall now tell you the name she was born with, and the name she later made famous: it was Marie Laveau. But this was not the great Marie Laveau, the one you have heard of, this was her mother, who eventually became the Widow Glapion), she had no interest in the gods of the distant land. If St. Domingo had been a lush black earth for the African gods to grow in, this land, with its corn and its melons, its crawfish and its cotton, was barren and infertile.
""She does not want to know,"" complained Mama Zouzou to Clémentine, her confidant, who took in the washing for many of the houses in that district, washing their curtains and coverlets. Clémentine had a blossom of burns on her cheek, and one of her children had been scalded to death when a copper overturned.
""Then do not teach her,"" says Clémentine.
""I teach her, but she does not see what is valuable-all she sees is what she can do with it. I give her diamonds, but she cares only for pretty glass. I give her a demi-bouteille of the best claret and she drinks river water. I give her quail and she wishes to eat only rat.""
""Then why do you persist?"" asks Clémentine.
Mama Zouzou shrugs her thin shoulders, causing her withered arm to shake.
She cannot answer. She could say that she teaches because she is grateful to be alive, and she is: she has seen too many die. She could say that she dreams that one day the slaves will rise, as they rose (and were defeated) in LaPlace, but that she knows in her heart that without the gods of Africa they will never overcome their white captors, will never return to their homelands.
When she woke that terrible night almost twenty years earlier, and felt the cold steel between her ribs, that was when Mama Zouzou's life had ended. Now she was someone who did not live, who simply hated. If you asked her about the hate she would have been unable to tell you about a twelve-year-old girl on a stinking ship: that had scabbed over in her mind-there had been too many whippings and beatings, too many nights in manacles, too many partings, too much pain. She could have told you about her son, though, and how his thumb had been cut off when their master discovered the boy was able to read and to write. She could have told you of her daughter, twelve years old and already eight months pregnant by an overseer, and how they dug a hole in the red earth to take her daughter's pregnant belly, and then they whipped her until her back had bled. Despite the carefully dug hole, her daughter had lost her baby and her life on a Sunday morning, when all the white folks were in church...
Too much pain.
""Worship them,"" Mama Zouzou told the young Widow Paris in the bayou, one hour after midnight. They were both naked to the waist, sweating in the humid night, their skins given accents by the white moonlight.
The Widow Paris's husband Jacques (whose own death, three years later, would have several remarkable features) had told Marie a little about the gods of St. Domingo, but she did not care. Power came from the rituals, not from the gods.
Together Mama Zouzou and the Widow Paris crooned and stamped and keened in the swamp. They were singing in the blacksnakes, the free woman of color and the slave woman with the withered arm.
""There is more to it than just, you prosper, your enemies fail,"" said Mama Zouzou.
Many of the words of the ceremonies, words she knew once, words her brother had also known, these words had fled from her memory. She told pretty Marie Laveau that the words did not matter, only the tunes and the beats, and there, singing and tapping in the blacksnakes, in the swamp, she has an odd vision. She sees the beats of the songs, the Calinda beat, the Bamboula beat, all the rhythms of equatorial Africa spreading slowly across this midnight land until the whole country shivers and swings to the beats of the old gods whose realms she had left. And even that, she understands somehow, in the swamp, even that will not be enough.
She turns to pretty Marie and sees herself through Marie's eyes, a black-skinned old woman, her face lined, her bony arm hanging limply by her side, her eyes the eyes of one who has seen her children fight in the trough for food from the dogs. She saw herself, and she knew then for the first time the revulsion and the fear the younger woman had for her.
Then she laughed, and crouched, and picked up in her good hand a blacksnake as tall as a sapling and as thick as a ship's rope.
""Here,"" she said. ""Here will be our voudon.""
She dropped the unresisting snake into a basket that yellow Marie was carrying.
And then, in the moonlight, the second sight possessed her for a final time, and she saw her brother Agasu, not the twelve-year-old boy she had last seen in the Bridgetown market so long ago, but a huge man, bald and grinning with broken teeth, his back lined with deep scars. In one hand he held a machete-knife. His right arm was barely a stump.
She reached out her own good left hand.
""Stay, stay a while,"" she whispered. ""I will be there. I will be with you soon.""
And Marie Paris thought the old woman was speaking to her.

-AGNES REPPLIER, TIMES AND TENDENCIES 
Shadow drove west, across Wisconsin and Minnesota and into North Dakota, where the snow-covered hills looked like huge sleeping buffalo, and he and Wednesday saw nothing but nothing and plenty of it for mile after mile. They went south, then, into South Dakota, heading for reservation country.
Wednesday had traded in the Lincoln town car, which Shadow had liked driving, for a lumbering and ancient Winnebago, which smelled non-specifically but pervasively and unmistakably of male cat, and which he didn't enjoy driving at all.
As they passed their first signpost for Mount Rushmore, still several hundred miles away, Wednesday grunted. ""Now that,"" he said, ""is a holy place.""
Shadow had thought Wednesday was asleep. He said, ""I know it used to be sacred to the Indians.""
""It's a holy place,"" said Wednesday. ""That's the American Way-they need to give people an excuse to come and worship. These days, people can't just go and see a mountain. Thus, Mister Gutzon Borglum's tremendous presidential faces. Once they were carved, permission was granted, and now the people drive out in their multitudes to see something in the flesh that they've already seen on a thousand postcards.""
""I knew a guy once. He did weight training at the Muscle Farm, years back. He said that the Dakota Indians, the young men climb up the mountain, then form death-defying human chains off the heads, just so that the guy at the end of the chain can piss on the president's nose.""
Wednesday guffawed. ""Oh, fine! Very fine! Is any specific president the particular butt of their ire?""
Shadow shrugged. ""He never said.""
Miles vanished beneath the wheels of the Winnebago. Shadow began to imagine that he was staying still while the American landscape moved past them at a steady sixty-seven miles per hour. A wintry mist fogged the edges of things.
It was midday on the second day of the drive, and they were almost there. Shadow, who had been thinking, said, ""A girl vanished from Lakeside last week. When we were in San Francisco.""
""Mm?"" Wednesday sounded barely interested.
""Kid named Alison McGovern. She's not the first kid to vanish there. There have been others. They go in the wintertime.""
Wednesday furrowed his brow. ""It is a tragedy, is it not? The little faces on the milk-cartons-although I can't remember the last time I saw a kid on a milk-carton-and on the walls of freeway rest areas. Have you seen me? they ask. A deeply existential question at the best of times. Have you seen me? Pull off at the next exit.""
Shadow thought he heard a helicopter pass overhead, but the clouds were too low to see anything.
""Why did you pick Lakeside?"" asked Shadow.
""I told you. It's a nice quiet place to hide you away. You're off the board there, under the radar.""
""Why?""
""Because that's the way it is. Now hang a left,"" said Wednesday.
Shadow turned left.
""There's something wrong,"" said Wednesday. ""Fuck. Jesus fucking Christ on a bicycle. Slow down, but don't stop.""
""Care to elaborate?""
""Trouble. Do you know any alternative routes?""
""Not really. This is my first time in South Dakota,"" said Shadow. ""Also I don't know where we're going.""
On the other side of the hill something flashed redly, smudged by the mist.
""Roadblock,"" said Wednesday. He pushed his hand deeply into first one pocket of his suit then another, searching for something.
""I can stop and turn around. If we had a jeep I'd go off-road, but the Winnebago's just going to tip if I try and drive her across that ditch.""
""We can't turn. They're behind us as well,"" said Wednesday. ""Take your speed down to ten, fifteen miles per hour.""
Shadow glanced into the mirror. There were headlights behind them, under a mile back. ""Are you sure about this?"" he asked.
Wednesday snorted. ""Sure as eggs is eggs,"" he said. ""As the turkey-farmer said when he hatched his first turtle. Ah, success!"" and from the bottom of a pocket he produced a small piece of white chalk.
He started to scratch with the chalk on the dashboard of the camper, making marks as if he were solving an algebraic puzzle-or perhaps, Shadow thought, as if he were a hobo, scratching long messages to the other hobos in hobo code-bad dog here, dangerous town, nice woman, soft jail in which to overnight...
""Okay,"" said Wednesday. ""Now increase your speed to thirty. And don't slow down from that.""
One of the cars behind them turned on its lights and siren and accelerated toward them. ""Do not slow down,"" repeated Wednesday. ""They just want us to slow before we get to the roadblock."" Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.
They crested the hill. The roadblock was less than a quarter of a mile away. Twelve cars arranged across the road, and on the side of the road, police cars, and several big black SUVs.
""There,"" said Wednesday, and he put his chalk away. The dashboard of the Winnebago was now covered with rune-like scratchings.
The car with the siren was just behind them. It had slowed to their speed, and an amplified voice was shouting, ""Pull over!"" Shadow looked at Wednesday.
""Turn right,"" said Wednesday. ""Just pull off the road.""
""I can't take this thing off-road. We'll tip.""
""It'll be fine. Take a right. Now!""
Shadow pulled the wheel down with his right hand, and the Winnebago lurched and jolted. For a moment he thought he had been correct, that the camper was going to tip, and then the world through the windshield dissolved and shimmered, like the reflection in a clear pool when the wind brushes the surface, and the Dakotas stretched and shifted.
The clouds and the mist and the snow and the day were gone.
Now there were stars overhead, hanging like frozen spears of light, stabbing the night sky.
""Park here,"" said Wednesday. ""We can walk the rest of the way.""
Shadow turned off the engine. He went into the back of the Winnebago, pulled on his coat, his Sorel winter boots, and his gloves. Then he climbed out of the vehicle and waited. ""Okay,"" he said. ""Let's go.""
Wednesday looked at him with amusement and something else-irritation perhaps. Or pride. ""Why don't you argue?"" asked Wednesday. ""Why don't you exclaim that it's all impossible? Why the hell do you just do what I say and take it all so fucking calmly?""
""Because you're not paying me to ask questions,"" said Shadow. And then he said, realizing the truth as the words came out of his mouth, ""Anyway, nothing's really surprised me since Laura.""
""Since she came back from the dead?""
""Since I learned she was screwing Robbie. That one hurt. Everything else just sits on the surface. Where are we going now?""
Wednesday pointed, and they began to walk. The ground beneath their feet was rock of some kind, slick and volcanic, occasionally glassy. The air was chilly, but not winter-cold. They sidestepped their way awkwardly down a hill. There was a rough path, and they followed it. Shadow looked down to the bottom of the hill, and realized that what he was looking at was impossible.
""What the hell is that?"" asked Shadow, but Wednesday touched his finger to his lips, shook his head sharply. Silence.
It looked like a mechanical spider, blue metal, glittering LED lights, and it was the size of a tractor. It squatted at the bottom of the hill. Beyond it were an assortment of bones, each with a flame beside it little bigger than a candle-flame, flickering.
Wednesday gestured for Shadow to keep his distance from these objects. Shadow took an extra step to the side, which was a mistake on that glassy path, as his ankle twisted and he tumbled down the slope as if he had been dropped, rolling and slipping and bouncing. He grabbed at a rock as he went past, and the obsidian snag ripped his leather glove as if it were paper.
He came to rest at the bottom of the hill, between the mechanical spider and the bones.
He put a hand down to push himself to his feet, and found himself touching what appeared to be a thighbone with the palm of his hand, and he was...
...standing in the daylight, smoking a cigarette, and looking at his watch. There were cars all around him, some empty, some not. He was wishing he had not had that last cup of coffee, for he dearly needed a piss, and it was starting to become uncomfortable.
One of the local law enforcement people came over to him, a big man with frost in his walrus moustache. He had already forgotten the man's name.
""I don't know how we could have lost them,"" says Local Law Enforcement, apologetic and puzzled.
""It was an optical illusion,"" he replies. ""You get them in freak weather conditions. The mist. It was a mirage. They were driving down some other road. We thought they were on this one.""
Local Law Enforcement looks disappointed. ""Oh. I thought it was maybe like an X-Files kinda thing,"" he says.
""Nothing so exciting, I'm afraid."" He suffers from occasional hemorrhoids and his ass has just started itching in the way that signals that a flare-up is coming. He wants to be back inside the Beltway. He wishes there was a tree to go and stand behind: the urge to piss is getting worse. He drops the cigarette and steps on it.
Local Law Enforcement walks over to one of the police cars and says something to the driver. They both shake their heads.
He wonders if he should simply grit his teeth, try to imagine that he is in Maui with no one else around, and piss against the rear wheel of the car. He wishes he weren't so utterly pee-shy, and he thinks maybe he can hold it in for longer but he finds himself remembering a newspaper clipping that someone had tacked up in the lounge in his frat house, thirty years before: the cautionary tale of an old man who had been on a long bus ride with a busted rest-room, who had held it in, and, at the end of his journey, needed to be catheterized in order ever to piss again...
That was ridiculous. He isn't that old. He is going to celebrate his fiftieth birthday in April, and his waterworks work just fine. Everything works just fine.
He pulls out his telephone, touches the menu, pages down, and finds the address entry marked ""Laundry"" which had amused him so much when he typed it in-a reference to The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and as he looks at it he realizes that it's not from that at all, that was a tailor's, he's thinking of Get Smart, and he still feels weird and slightly embarrassed after all these years about not realizing it was a comedy when he was a kid, and just wanting a shoephone...
A woman's voice on the phone. ""Yes?""
""This is Mister Town, for Mister World.""
""Hold please. I'll see if he's available.""
There is silence. Town crosses his legs, tugs his belt higher on his belly-got to lose these last ten pounds-and away from his bladder. Then an urbane voice says, ""Hello, Mister Town.""
""We lost them,"" says Town. He feels a knot of frustration in his gut: these were the bastards, the lousy dirty sons of bitches who killed Woody and Stone, for Chrissakes. Good men. Good men. He badly wants to fuck Mrs. Wood, but knows it's still too soon after Woody's death to make a move, so he is taking her out for dinner every couple of weeks, an investment in the future, she's just grateful for the attention...
""How?""
""I don't know. We set up a roadblock, there was nowhere they could have gone and they went there anyway.""
""Just another one of life's little mysteries. Not to worry. Have you calmed the locals?""
""Told 'em it was an optical illusion.""
""They buy it?""
""Probably.""
There was something very familiar about Mr. World's voice-which was a strange thing to think, he'd been working for him directly for two years now, spoken to him every day, of course there was something familiar about his voice.
""They'll be far away by now.""
""Should we send people down to the rez to intercept them?""
""Not worth the aggravation. Too many jurisdictional issues, and there are only so many strings we can pull in a morning. We have plenty of time. Just get back here. I've got my hands full at this end trying to organize the policy meeting.""
""Trouble?""
""It's a pissing contest. I've proposed that we have it out here. The techies want it in Austin, or maybe San Jose, the players want it in Hollywood, the intangibles want it on Wall Street. Everybody wants it in their own back yard. Nobody's going to give.""
""You need me to do anything?""
""Not yet. I'll growl at some of them, stroke others. You know the routine.""
""Yes, sir.""
""Carry on, Town.""
The connection is broken.
Town thinks he should have had a SWAT team to pick off that fucking Winnebago, or land-mines on the road, or a tactical friggin' nukuler device, that would have showed those bastards they meant business. It was like Mr. World had once said to him, We are writing the future in Letters of Fire, and Mr. Town thinks that Jesus Christ if he doesn't piss now he'll lose a kidney, it'll just burst, and it was like his pop had said when they were on long journeys, when Town was a kid, out on the interstate, his pop would always say, ""My back teeth are afloat,"" and Mr. Town could hear that voice even now, that sharp Yankee accent saying, ""I got to take a leak soon. My back teeth are afloat""...
...and it was then that Shadow felt a hand opening his own hand, prising it open one finger at a time, off the thighbone it was clutching. He no longer needed to urinate; that was someone else. He was standing under the stars on a glassy rock plain, and the bone was down on the ground beside the other bones.
Wednesday made the signal for silence again. Then he began to walk, and Shadow followed.
There was a creak from the mechanical spider, and Wednesday froze. Shadow stopped and waited with him. Green lights flickered and ran up and along its side in clusters. Shadow tried not to breathe too loudly.
He thought about what had just happened. It had been like looking through a window into someone else's mind. And then he thought, Mr. World. It was me who thought his voice sounded familiar. That was my thought, not Town's. That was why that seemed so strange. He tried to identify the voice in his mind, to put it into the category in which it belonged, but it eluded him.
It'll come to me, thought Shadow. Sooner or later, it'll come to me.
The green lights went blue, then red, then faded to a dull red, and the spider settled down on its metallic haunches. Wednesday began to walk forward, a lonely figure beneath the stars, in a broad-brimmed hat, his frayed dark cloak gusting randomly in the nowhere wind, his staff tapping on the glassy rock floor.
When the metallic spider was only a distant glint in the starlight, far back on the plain, Wednesday said, ""It should be safe to speak, now.""
""Where are we?""
""Behind the scenes,"" said Wednesday.
""Sorry?""
""Think of it as being behind the scenes. Like in a theatre or something. I just pulled us out of the audience and now we're walking about backstage. It's a shortcut.""
""When I touched that bone. I was in the mind of a guy named Town. He's with that spookshow. He hates us.""
""Yes.""
""He's got a boss named Mister World. He reminds me of someone, but I don't know who. I was looking into Town's head-or maybe I was in his head. I'm not certain.""
""Do they know where we're headed?""
""I think they're calling off the hunt right now. They didn't want to follow us to the reservation. Are we going to a reservation?""
""Maybe."" Wednesday leaned on his staff for a moment, then continued to walk.
""What was that spider thing?""
""A pattern manifestation. A search engine.""
""Are they dangerous?""
""You only get to be my age by assuming the worst.""
Shadow smiled. ""And how old would that be?""
""Old as my tongue,"" said Wednesday. ""And a few months older than my teeth.""
""You play your cards so close to your chest,"" said Shadow, ""that I'm not even sure that they're really cards at all.""
Wednesday only grunted.
Each hill they came to was harder to climb.
Shadow began to feel headachy. There was a pounding quality to the starlight, something that resonated with the pulse in his temples and his chest. At the bottom of the next hill he stumbled, opened his mouth to say something and, without warning, he vomited.
Wednesday reached into an inside pocket, and produced a small hip flask. ""Take a sip of this,"" he said. ""Only a sip.""
The liquid was pungent, and it evaporated in his mouth like a good brandy, although it did not taste like alcohol. Wednesday took the flask away, and pocketed it. ""It's not good for the audience to find themselves walking about backstage. That's why you're feeling sick. We need to hurry to get you out of here.""
They walked faster-Wednesday at a solid trudge, Shadow stumbling from time to time, but feeling better for the drink, which left his mouth tasting of orange peel, of rosemary oil and peppermint and cloves.
Wednesday took his arm. ""There,"" he said, pointing to two identical hillocks of frozen rock-glass to their left. ""Walk between those two mounds. Walk beside me.""
They walked, and the cold air and bright daylight smashed into Shadow's face at the same time. He stopped, closed his eyes, dazzled and light-blinded, then, shading his eyes with his hand, he opened them once more.
They were standing halfway up a gentle hill. The mist had gone, the day was sunny and chill, the sky was a perfect blue. At the bottom of the hill was a gravel road, and a red station wagon bounced along it like a child's toy car. A gust of wood smoke stung Shadow's face, making his eyes tear. The smoke came from a building nearby, which looked as if someone had picked up a mobile home and dropped it on the side of the hill thirty years ago. It was much repaired, patched, and, in places, added onto: Shadow was certain that the galvanized tin chimney, from which the wood smoke was coming, was not part of the original structure.
As they reached the door it opened, and a middle-aged man with dark skin, sharp eyes and a mouth like a knife-slash looked down at them and said, ""Eyah, I heard that there were two white men on their way to see me. Two whites in a Winnebago. And I heard that they got lost, like white men always get lost if they don't put up their signs everywhere. And now look at these two sorry beasts at the door. You know you're on Lakota land?"" His hair was gray, and long.
""Since when were you Lakota, you old fraud?"" said Wednesday. He was wearing a coat and a flap-eared cap, and already it seemed to Shadow unlikely that only a few moments ago under the stars he had been wearing a broad-brimmed hat and a tattered cloak. ""So, Whiskey Jack. You sad bastard. I'm starving, and my friend here just threw up his breakfast. Are you going to invite us in?""
Whiskey Jack scratched an armpit. He was wearing blue jeans and an undershirt the gray of his hair. He wore moccasins, and he seemed not to notice the cold. Then he said, ""I like it here. Come in, white men who lost their Winnebago.""
There was more wood smoke in the air inside the trailer, and there was another man in there, sitting at a table. The man wore stained buckskins, and was barefoot. His skin was the color of bark.
Wednesday seemed delighted. ""Well,"" he said, ""it seems our delay was fortuitous. Whiskey Jack and Apple Johnny. Two birds with one stone.""
The man at the table, Apple Johnny, stared at Wednesday, then he reached down a hand to his crotch, cupped it and said, ""Wrong again. I jes' checked and I got both of my stones, jes' where they oughta be."" He looked up at Shadow, raised his hand, palm out. ""I'm John Chapman. You don't mind anything your boss says about me. He's an asshole. Always was an asshole. Always goin' to be an asshole. Some people is jes' assholes, and that's an end of it.""
""Mike Ainsel,"" said Shadow.
Chapman rubbed his stubbly chin. ""Ainsel,"" he said. ""That's not a name. But it'll do at a pinch. What do they call you?""
""Shadow.""
""I'll call you Shadow, then. Hey, Whiskey Jack""-but it wasn't really Whiskey Jack he was saying, Shadow realized; too many syllables-""how's the food looking?""
Whiskey Jack took a wooden spoon and lifted the lid off a black iron pot, bubbling away on the range of the wood-burning stove. ""It's ready for eating,"" he said.
He took four plastic bowls and spooned the contents of the pot into the bowls, put them down on the table. Then he opened the door, stepped out into the snow, and pulled a plastic gallon jug from the snow bank. He brought it inside, and poured four large glasses of a cloudy yellow-brown liquid, which he put beside each bowl. Last of all, he found four spoons. He sat down at the table with the other men.
Wednesday raised his glass suspiciously. ""Looks like piss,"" he said.
""You still drinking that stuff?"" asked Whiskey Jack. ""You white men are crazy. This is better."" Then, to Shadow, ""The stew is mostly wild turkey. John here brought the applejack.""
""It's a soft apple cider,"" said John Chapman. ""I never believed in hard liquor. Makes men mad.""
The stew was delicious, and it was very good apple cider. Shadow forced himself to slow down, to chew his food, not to gulp it, but he was more hungry than he would have believed. He helped himself to a second bowl of the stew and a second glass of the cider.
""Dame Rumor says that you've been out talking to all manner of folk, offering them all manner of things. Says you're takin' the old folks on the war path,"" said John Chapman. Shadow and Whiskey Jack were washing up, putting the leftover stew into Tupperware bowls. Whiskey Jack put the bowls into the snowdrifts outside his front door, and put a milk crate on top of the place he'd pushed them, so he could find them again.
""I think that's a fair and judicious summary of events,"" said Wednesday.
""They will win,"" said Whiskey Jack flatly. ""They won already. You lost already. Like the white man and my people. They won. And when they lost, they made treaties. Then they broke the treaties. And they won again. I'm not fighting for another lost cause.""
""And it's no use you lookin' at me,"" said John Chapman, ""for even if I fought for you-which'n I won't-I'm no use to you. Mangy rat-tailed bastards jes' picked me off and clean forgot me."" He stopped. Then he said, ""Paul Bunyan."" He shook his head slowly and he said it again. ""Paul Bunyan."" Shadow had never heard two such innocuous words made to sound so damning.
""Paul Bunyan?"" Shadow said. ""What did he ever do?""
""He took up head space,"" said Whiskey Jack. He bummed a cigarette from Wednesday and the two men sat and smoked.
""It's like the idiots who figure that hummingbirds worry about their weight or tooth decay or some such nonsense, maybe they just want to spare hummingbirds the evils of sugar,"" explained Wednesday. ""So they fill the hummingbird feeders with fucking NutraSweet. The birds come to the feeders and they drink it. Then they die, because their food contains no calories even though their little tummies are full. That's Paul Bunyan for you. Nobody ever told Paul Bunyan stories. Nobody ever believed in Paul Bunyan. He came staggering out of a New York ad agency in 1910 and filled the nation's myth stomach with empty calories.""
""I like Paul Bunyan,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""I went on his ride at the Mall of America, few years back. You see big old Paul Bunyan at the top then you come crashing down. Splash. He's okay by me. I don't mind that he never existed, means he never cut down any trees. Not as good as planting trees though. That's better.""
""You said a mouthful,"" said Johnny Chapman.
Wednesday blew a smoke ring. It hung in the air like something from a Warner Bros. cartoon, dissipating slowly in wisps and curls. ""Damn it, Whiskey Jack, that's not the point and you know it.""
""I'm not going to help you,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""When you get your ass kicked, you can come back here and if I'm still here I'll feed you again. You get the best food in the fall.""
Wednesday said, ""All the alternatives are worse.""
""You have no idea what the alternatives are,"" said Whiskey Jack. Then he looked at Shadow. ""You are hunting,"" he said. His voice was cigarette-roughened, and it resonated in that space, smoky with leaking wood smoke and cigarettes.
""I'm working,"" said Shadow.
Whiskey Jack shook his head. ""You are also hunting something,"" he said. ""There is a debt that you wish to pay.""
Shadow thought of Laura's blue lips and the blood on her hands, and he nodded.
""Listen. Fox was here first, and his brother was the wolf. Fox said, people will live forever. If they die they will not die for long. Wolf said, no, people will die, people must die, all things that live must die, or they will spread and cover the world, and eat all the salmon and the caribou and the buffalo, eat all the squash and all the corn. Now one day Wolf died, and he said to the fox, quick, bring me back to life. And Fox said, No, the dead must stay dead. You convinced me. And he wept as he said this. But he said it, and it was final. Now Wolf rules the world of the dead and Fox lives always under the sun and the moon, and he still mourns his brother.""
Wednesday said, ""If you won't play, you won't play. We'll be moving on.""
Whiskey Jack's face was impassive. ""I'm talking to this young man,"" he said. ""You are beyond help. He is not."" He turned back to Shadow. ""You know, you cannot come to me here unless I wish it.""
Shadow realized that he did know this. ""Yes.""
""Tell me your dream,"" said Whiskey Jack.
Shadow said, ""I was climbing a tower of skulls. There were huge birds flying around it. They had lightning in their wings. They were attacking me. The tower fell.""
""Everybody dreams,"" said Wednesday. ""Can we hit the road?""
""Not everybody dreams of the Wakinyau, the thunderbirds,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""We felt the echoes of it here.""
""I told you,"" said Wednesday. ""Jesus.""
""There's a clutch of thunderbirds in West Virginia,"" said Chapman, idly. ""A couple of hens and an old cock-bird at least. There's also a breeding pair in the land, they used to call it the State of Franklin, but old Ben never got his state, up between Kentucky and Tennessee. Course, there was never a great number of them, even at the best of times.""
Whiskey Jack reached out a hand the color of the red clay, and he touched Shadow's face, gently. His irises were light brown banded with dark brown, and in that face those eyes seemed luminous. ""Eyah,"" he said. ""It's true. If you hunt the thunderbird you could bring your woman back. But she belongs to the wolf, in the dead places, not walking the land.""
""How do you know?"" asked Shadow.
Whiskey Jack's lips did not move. ""What did the Buffalo tell you?""
""To believe.""
""Good advice. Are you going to follow it?""
""Kind of. I guess."" They were talking without words, without mouths, without sound. Shadow wondered if, for the other two men in the room, they were standing, unmoving, for a heartbeat or for a fraction of a heartbeat.
""When you find your tribe, come back and see me,"" said Whiskey Jack. ""I can help.""
""I shall.""
Whiskey jack lowered his hand. Then he turned to Wednesday. ""Are you going to fetch your Ho Chunk?""
""My what?""
""Ho Chunk. It's what the Winnebago call themselves.""
Wednesday shook his head. ""It's too risky. Retrieving it could be problematic. They'll be looking for it.""
""Is it stolen?""
Wednesday looked affronted. ""Not a bit of it. The papers are in the glove compartment.""
""And the keys?""
""I've got them,"" said Shadow.
""My nephew, Harry Bluejay, has an '81 Buick. Why don't you give me the keys to your camper? You can take his car.""
Wednesday bristled. ""What kind of trade is that?""
Whiskey Jack shrugged. ""You know how hard it will be to bring back your camper from where you abandoned it? I'm doing you a favor. Take it or leave it. I don't care."" He closed his knife-wound mouth.
Wednesday looked angry, and then the anger became rue, and he said, ""Shadow, give the man the keys to the Winnebago."" Shadow passed the car keys to Whiskey Jack.
""Johnny,"" said Whiskey Jack, ""will you take these men down to find Harry Bluejay? Tell him I said for him to give them his car.""
""Be my pleasure,"" said John Chapman.
He got up and walked to the door, picked up a small Hessian sack sitting next to it, opened the door and walked outside. Shadow and Wednesday followed him. Whiskey Jack waited in the doorway. ""Hey,"" he said to Wednesday. ""Don't come back here, you. You are not welcome.""
Wednesday extended his middle finger heavenward. ""Rotate on this,"" he said affably.
They walked downhill through the snow, pushing their way through the drifts. Chapman walked in front, his bare feet red against the crust-topped snow. ""Aren't you cold?"" asked Shadow.
""My wife was Choctaw,"" said Chapman.
""And she taught you mystical ways to keep out the cold?""
""Nope. She thought I was crazy,"" said Chapman. ""She used t'say, 'Johnny, why don't you jes' put on boots?'"" The slope of the hill became steeper, and they were forced to stop talking. The three men stumbled and slipped on the snow, using the trunks of birch trees on the hillside to steady themselves, and to stop themselves from falling. When the ground became slightly more level, Chapman said, ""She's dead now, a'course. When she died I guess maybe I went a mite crazy. It could happen to anyone. It could happen to you."" He clapped Shadow on the arm. ""By Jesus and Jehosophat, you're a big man.""
""So they tell me,"" said Shadow.
They trudged down that hill for another half an hour, until they reached the gravel road that wound around the base of it, and the three men began to walk along it, toward the cluster of buildings they had seen from high on the hill.
A car slowed and stopped. The woman driving it reached over, wound down the passenger window, and said, ""You bozos need a ride?""
""You are very gracious, madam,"" said Wednesday. ""We're looking for a Mister Harry Bluejay.""
""He'll be down at the rec hall,"" said the woman. She was in her forties, Shadow guessed. ""Get in.""
They got in. Wednesday took the passenger seat, John Chapman and Shadow climbed into the back. Shadow's legs were too long to sit in the back comfortably, but he did the best he could. The car jolted forward, down the gravel road.
""So where did you three come from?"" asked the driver.
""Just visiting with a friend,"" said Wednesday.
""Lives on the hill back there,"" said Shadow.
""What hill?"" she asked.
Shadow looked back through the dusty rear window, looking back at the hill. But there was no high hill back there; nothing but clouds on the plains.
""Whiskey Jack,"" he said.
""Ah,"" she said. ""We call him Inktomi here. I think it's the same guy. My grandfather used to tell some pretty good stories about him. Of course, all the best of them were kind of dirty."" They hit a bump in the road, and the woman swore. ""You okay back there?""
""Yes, ma'am,"" said Johnny Chapman. He was holding on to the back seat with both hands.
""Rez roads,"" she said. ""You get used to them.""
""Are they all like this?"" asked Shadow.
""Pretty much,"" said the woman. ""All the ones round here. And don't you go asking about all the money from casinos, because who in their right mind wants to come all the way out here to go to a casino? We don't see none of that money out here.""
""I'm sorry.""
""Don't be."" She changed gears with a crash and a groan. ""You know the white population all round here is falling? You go out there, you find ghost towns. How you going to keep them down on the farm, after they seen the world on their television screens? And it's not worth anyone's while to farm the Badlands anyhow. They took our lands, they settled here, now they're leaving. They go south. They go west. Maybe if we wait for enough of them to move to New York and Miami and L.A. we can take the whole of the middle back without a fight.""
""Good luck,"" said Shadow.
They found Harry Bluejay in the rec hall, at the pool table, doing trick shots to impress a group of several girls. He had a blue jay tattooed on the back of his right hand, and multiple piercings in his right ear.
""Ho hoka, Harry Bluejay,"" said John Chapman.
""Fuck off, you crazy barefoot white ghost,"" said Harry Bluejay, conversationally. ""You give me the creeps.""
There were older men at the far end of the room, some of them playing cards, some of them talking. There were other men, younger men of about Harry Bluejay's age, waiting for their turn at the pool table. It was a full-sized pool table, and a rip in the green baize on one side had been repaired with silver-gray duct tape.
""I got a message from your uncle,"" said Chapman, unfazed. ""He says you're to give these two your car.""
There must have been thirty, maybe even forty people in that hall, and now they were every one of them looking intently at their playing cards, or their feet, or their fingernails, and pretending as hard as they could not to be listening.
""He's not my uncle.""
A cigarette-smoke fug hung over the hall like a cirrus cloud. Chapman smiled widely, displaying the worst set of teeth that Shadow had seen in a human mouth. ""You want to tell your uncle that? He says you're the only reason he stays among the Lakota.""
""Whiskey Jack says a lot of things,"" said Harry Bluejay, petulantly. But he did not say Whiskey Jack either. It sounded almost the same, to Shadow's ear, but not quite: Wisakedjak, he thought. That's what they're saying. Not Whiskey Jack at all.
Shadow said, ""Yeah. And one of the things he said was that we're trading our Winnebago for your Buick.""
""I don't see a Winnebago.""
""He'll bring you the Winnebago,"" said John Chapman. ""You know he will.""
Harry Bluejay attempted a trick shot and missed. His hand was not steady enough. ""I'm not the old fox's nephew,"" said Harry Bluejay. ""I wish he wouldn't say that to people.""
""Better a live fox than a dead wolf,"" said Wednesday, in a voice so deep it was almost a growl. ""Now, will you sell us your car?""
Harry Bluejay shivered, visibly and violently. ""Sure,"" he said. ""Sure. I was only kidding. I kid a lot, me."" He put down the pool cue on the pool table, and took a thick jacket, pulling it out from a cluster of similar jackets hanging from pegs by the door. ""Let me get my shit out of the car first,"" he said.
He kept darting glances at Wednesday, as if he were concerned that the older man was about to explode.
Harry Bluejay's car was parked a hundred yards away. As they walked toward it, they passed a small whitewashed Catholic church, and a fair-haired man in a priest's collar who stared at them from the doorway as they went past. He was sucking on a cigarette as if he did not enjoy smoking it.
""Good day to you, father!"" called Johnny Chapman, but the man in the dog-collar made no reply; he crushed his cigarette under his heel, picked up the butt, and dropped it into the bin beside the door, and went inside.
""I told you not to give him those pamphlets last time you were here,"" said Harry Bluejay.
""It is he that is in error, not me,"" said Chapman. ""If he'd jes read the Swedenborg I gave him he'd know that. It'd bring light into his life.""
Harry Bluejay's car was missing its side mirrors, and its tires were the baldest Shadow had ever seen: perfectly smooth black rubber. Harry Bluejay told them the car drank oil, but as long as you kept pouring oil in, it would just keep running forever, unless it stopped.
Harry Bluejay filled a black garbage bag with shit from the car (said shit including several screw-top bottles of cheap beer, unfinished, a small packet of cannabis resin wrapped in silver foil and badly hidden in the car's ashtray, a skunk-tail, two dozen country and western cassettes and a battered, yellowing copy of Stranger in a Strange Land). ""Sorry I was jerking your chain before,"" said Harry Bluejay to Wednesday, passing him the car keys. ""You know when I'll get the Winnebago?""
""Ask your uncle. He's the fucking used-car dealer,"" growled Wednesday.
""Wisakedjak is not my uncle,"" said Harry Bluejay. He took his black garbage bag and went into the nearest house, and closed the door behind him.
They dropped Johnny Chapman in Sioux Falls, outside a whole-food store.
Wednesday said nothing on the drive. He was brooding.
In a family restaurant just outside St. Paul Shadow picked up a newspaper someone else had put down. He looked at it once, then again, then he showed it to Wednesday. Wednesday was in a black sulk, as he had been since they left Whiskey Jack's place.
""Look at that,"" said Shadow.
Wednesday sighed, and looked down at the paper with an expression of pain, as if lowering his head hurt more than he could put into words. ""I am,"" he said, ""delighted that the air-traffic controllers' dispute has been resolved without recourse to industrial action.""
""Not that,"" said Shadow. ""Look. It says it's the fourteenth of February.""
""Happy Valentine's Day.""
""So we set out January the what, twentieth, twenty-first? I wasn't keeping track of the dates, but it was the third week of January. We were three days on the road, all told. So how is it the fourteenth of February?""
""Because we walked for almost a month,"" said Wednesday. ""In the Badlands. Backstage.""
""Hell of a shortcut,"" said Shadow.
Wednesday pushed the paper away. ""Fucking Johnny Appleseed, always going on about Paul Bunyan. In real life Chapman owned fourteen apple orchards. He farmed thousands of acres. Yes, he kept pace with the western frontier, but there's not a story out there about him with a word of truth in it, save that he went a little crazy once. But it doesn't matter. Like the newspapers used to say, if the truth isn't big enough, you print the legend. This country needs its legends. And even the legends don't believe it any more.""
""But you see it.""
""I'm a has-been. Who the fuck cares about me?""
Shadow said softly, ""You're a god.""
Wednesday looked at him sharply. He seemed to be about to say something, and then he slumped back in his seat, and looked down at the menu and said, ""So?""
""It's a good thing to be a god,"" said Shadow.
""Is it?"" asked Wednesday, and this time it was Shadow who looked away.
In a gas station twenty-five miles outside Lakeside, on the wall by the restrooms, Shadow saw a homemade photocopied notice: a black and white photo of Alison McGovern and the handwritten question Have You Seen Me? above it. Same yearbook photograph: smiling confidently, a girl with rubber-band braces on her top teeth who wants to work with animals when she grows up. Have you seen me?
Shadow bought a Snickers bar, a bottle of water, and a copy of the Lakeside News. The above-the-fold story, written by Marguerite Olsen, our Lakeside Reporter, showed a photograph of a boy and an older man, out on the frozen lake, standing by an outhouse-like ice-fishing shack, and between them they were holding a big fish. They were smiling. Father and Son Catch Record Northern Pike. Full story inside.
Wednesday was driving. He said, ""Read me anything interesting you find in the paper.""
Shadow looked carefully, and he turned the pages slowly, but he couldn't find anything.
Wednesday dropped him off in the driveway outside his apartment. A smoke-colored cat stared at him from the driveway, then fled when he bent to stroke it.
Shadow stopped on the wooden deck outside his apartment and looked out at the lake, dotted here and there with green and brown ice-fishing huts. Many of them had cars parked beside them. On the ice nearer the bridge sat the old green klunker, just as it had sat in the newspaper. ""March the twenty-third,"" said Shadow, encouragingly. ""Round nine fifteen in the morning. You can do it.""
""Not a chance,"" said a woman's voice. ""April third. Six P.M. That way the day warms up the ice."" Shadow smiled. Marguerite Olsen was wearing a ski suit. She was at the far end of the deck, refilling the bird feeder with white blocks of suet.
""I read your article in the Lakeside News on the Town Record Northern Pike.""
""Exciting, huh?""
""Well, educational, maybe.""
""I thought you weren't coming back to us,"" she said. ""You were gone for a while, huh?""
""My uncle needed me,"" said Shadow. ""The time kind of got away from us.""
She placed the last suet brick in its cage, and began to fill a net sock with thistle-seeds from a plastic milk-jug. Several goldfinches, olive in their winter coats, twitted impatiently from a nearby fir-tree.
""I didn't see anything in the paper about Alison McGovern.""
""There wasn't anything to report. She's still missing. There was a rumor that someone had seen her in Detroit, but it turned out to be a false alarm.""
""Poor kid.""
Marguerite Olsen screwed the top back onto the gallon jug. ""I hope she's dead,"" she said, matter-of-factly.
Shadow was shocked. ""Why?""
""Because the alternatives are worse.""
The goldfinches hopped frantically from branch to branch of the fir-tree, impatient for the people to be gone. A downy woodpecker joined them.
You aren't thinking about Alison, thought Shadow. You're thinking of your son. You're thinking of Sandy.
He remembered someone saying I miss Sandy. Who was that?
""Good talking to you,"" he said.
""Yeah,"" she said. ""You, too.""
  
February passed in a succession of short, gray days. Some days the snow fell, most days it didn't. The weather warmed up, and on the good days it got above freezing. Shadow stayed in his apartment until it began to feel like a prison cell, and then, on the days that Wednesday did not need him, he began to walk.
He would walk for much of the day, long trudges out of the town. He walked, alone, until he reached the national forest to the north and the west, or the corn fields and cow pastures to the south. He walked the Lumber County Wilderness Trail, and he walked along the old railroad tracks, and he walked the back roads. A couple of times he even walked along the frozen lake, from north to south. Sometimes he'd see locals or winter tourists or joggers, and he'd wave and say hi. Mostly he saw nobody at all, just crows and finches and, a few times, he spotted a hawk feasting on a roadkill possum or raccoon. On one memorable occasion he watched an eagle snatch a silver fish from the middle of the White Pine River, the water frozen at the edges, but still rushing and flowing at the center. The fish wriggled and jerked in the eagle's talons, glittering in the midday sun; Shadow imagined the fish freeing itself and swimming off across the sky, and he smiled.
If he walked, he discovered, he did not have to think, and that was just the way he liked it; when he thought, his mind went to places he could not control, places that made him feel uncomfortable. Exhaustion was the best thing. When he was exhausted, his thoughts did not wander to Laura, or to the strange dreams, or to things that were not and could not be. He would return home from walking, and sleep without difficulty and without dreaming.
He ran into Police Chief Chad Mulligan in George's Barber Shop in the town square. Shadow always had high hopes for haircuts, but they never lived up to his expectations. After every haircut he looked more or less the same, only with shorter hair. Chad, seated in the barber's chair beside Shadow's, seemed surprisingly concerned about his own appearance. When his haircut was finished he gazed grimly at his reflection, as if he were preparing to give it a speeding ticket.
""It looks good,"" Shadow told him.
""Would it look good to you if you were a woman?""
""I guess.""
They went across the square to Mabel's together, ordered mugs of hot chocolate. Chad said, ""Hey. Mike. Have you ever thought about a career in law enforcement?""
Shadow shrugged. ""I can't say I have,"" he said. ""Seems like there's a whole lot of things you got to know.""
Chad shook his head. ""You know the main part of police work, somewhere like this? It's just keeping your head. Something happens, somebody's screaming at you, screaming blue murder, you simply have to be able to say that you're sure that it's all a mistake, and you'll just sort it all out if they just step outside quietly. And you have to be able to mean it.""
""And then you sort it out?""
""Mostly, that's when you put handcuffs on them. But yeah, you do what you can to sort it out. Let me know if you want a job. We're hiring. And you're the kind of guy we want.""
""I'll keep that in mind, if the thing with my uncle falls through.""
They sipped their hot chocolate. Mulligan said, ""Say, Mike, what would you do if you had a cousin? Like a widow. And she started calling you?""
""Calling you how?""
""On the phone. Long distance. She lives out of state."" His cheeks crimsoned. ""I saw her last year at a family wedding, out in Oregon. She was married, back then, though, I mean, her husband was still alive, and she's family. Not a first cousin. Pretty distant.""
""You got a thing for her?""
Blush. ""I don't know about that.""
""Well then, put it another way. Does she have a thing for you?""
""Well, she's said a few things when she called. She's a very fine-looking woman.""
""So...what are you going to do about it?""
""I could ask her out here. I could do that, couldn't I? She's kind of said she'd like to come up here.""
""You're both adults. I'd say go for it.""
Chad nodded, and blushed, and nodded again.
The telephone in Shadow's apartment was silent and dead. He thought about getting it connected, but could think of no one he wanted to call. Late one night he picked it up and listened, and was convinced that he could hear a wind blowing and a distant conversation between a group of people whose voices were too faint to distinguish. He said, ""Hello?"" and ""Who's there?"" but there was no reply, only a sudden silence and then the faraway sound of laughter, so faint he was not certain he was not imagining it.
  
Shadow made more journeys with Wednesday in the weeks that followed.
He waited in the kitchen of a Rhode Island cottage, and listened while Wednesday sat in a darkened bedroom and argued with a woman who would not get out of bed, nor would she let Wednesday or Shadow look at her face. In the refrigerator was a plastic bag filled with crickets, and another filled with the corpses of baby mice.
In a rock club in Seattle Shadow watched Wednesday shout his greeting, over the noise of the band, to a young woman with short red hair and blue-spiral tattoos. That talk must have gone well, for Wednesday came away from it grinning delightedly.
Five days later Shadow was waiting in the rental when Wednesday walked, scowling, from the lobby of an office building in Dallas. Wednesday slammed the car door when he got in, and sat there in silence, his face red with rage. He said, ""Drive."" Then he said, ""Fucking Albanians. Like anybody cares.""
Three days after that they flew to Boulder, where they had a pleasant lunch with five young Japanese women. It was a meal of pleasantries and politeness, and Shadow walked away from it unsure of whether anything had been agreed to or decided. Wednesday, though, seemed happy enough.
Shadow had begun to look forward to returning to Lakeside. There was a peace there, and a welcome, that he appreciated.
Each morning, when he was not away working for Wednesday, he would drive across the bridge to the town square. He would buy two pasties at Mabel's; he would eat one pasty then and there, and drink a coffee. If someone had left a newspaper out he would read it, although he was never interested enough in the news to purchase a newspaper himself.
He would pocket the second pasty, wrapped in its paper bag, and eat it for his lunch.
He was reading USA Today one morning when Mabel said, ""Hey, Mike. Where you going today?""
The sky was pale blue. The morning mist had left the trees covered with hoarfrost. ""I don't know,"" said Shadow. ""Maybe I'll walk the wilderness trail again.""
She refilled his coffee. ""You ever gone east on County Q? It's kind of pretty out thataway. That's the little road that starts acrost from the carpet store on Twentieth Avenue.""
""No. Never have.""
""Well,"" she said, ""it's kind of pretty.""
It was extremely pretty. Shadow parked his car at the edge of town, and walked along the side of the road, a winding, country road that curled around the hills to the east of the town. Each of the hills was covered with leafless maple trees, and bone-white birches, and dark firs and pines. There was no footpath, and Shadow walked along the middle of the road, making for the side whenever he heard a car.
At one point a small dark cat kept pace with him beside the road. It was the color of dirt, with white forepaws. He walked over to it. It did not run away.
""Hey, cat,"" said Shadow, unselfconsciously.
The cat put its head on one side, looked up at him with emerald eyes. Then it hissed-not at him, but at something over on the side of the road, something he could not see.
""Easy,"" said Shadow. The cat stalked away across the road, and vanished into a field of old unharvested corn.
Around the next bend in the road Shadow came upon a tiny graveyard. The headstones were weathered, although several of them had sprays of fresh flowers resting against them. There was no wall about the graveyard, and no fence, only low mulberry trees, planted at the margins, bent over with ice and age. Shadow stepped over the piled-up ice and slush at the side of the road. There were two stone gateposts marking the entry to the graveyard, although there was no gate between them. He walked into the graveyard between the two posts.
He wandered around the graveyard, looking at the headstones. There were no inscriptions later than 1969. He brushed the snow from a solid-looking granite angel, and he leaned against it.
He took the paper bag from his pocket, and removed the pasty from it. He broke off the top: it breathed a faint wisp of steam into the wintry air. It smelled really good, too. He bit into it.
Something rustled behind him. He thought for a moment it was the cat, but then he smelled perfume, and under the perfume, the scent of something rotten.
""Please don't look at me,"" she said, from behind him.
""Hello, Laura,"" said Shadow.
Her voice was hesitant, perhaps, he thought, even a little scared. She said, ""Hello, puppy.""
He broke off some pasty. ""Would you like some?"" he asked.
She was standing immediately behind him, now. ""No,"" she said. ""You eat it. I don't eat food any more.""
He ate his pasty. It was good. ""I want to look at you,"" he said.
""You won't like it,"" she told him.
""Please?""
She stepped around the stone angel. Shadow looked at her, in the daylight. Some things were different and some things were the same. Her eyes had not changed, nor had the crooked hopefulness of her smile. And she was, very obviously, very dead. Shadow finished his pasty. He stood up and tipped the crumbs out of the paper bag, then folded it up and put it back into his pocket.
The time he had spent in the funeral home in Cairo made it easier somehow for him to be in her presence. He did not know what to say to her.
Her cold hand sought his, and he squeezed it gently. He could feel his heart beating in his chest. He was scared, and what scared him was the normality of the moment. He felt so comfortable with her at his side that he would have been willing to stand there forever.
""I miss you,"" he admitted.
""I'm here,"" she said.
""That's when I miss you most. When you're here. When you aren't here, when you're just a ghost from the past or a dream from another life, it's easier then.""
She squeezed his fingers.
""So,"" he asked. ""How's death?""
""Hard,"" she said. ""It just keeps going.""
She rested her head on his shoulder, and it almost undid him. He said, ""You want to walk for a bit?""
""Sure."" She smiled up at him, a nervous, crooked smile in a dead face.
They walked out of the little graveyard, and made their way back down the road, toward the town, hand in hand. ""Where have you been?"" she asked.
""Here,"" he said. ""Mostly.""
""Since Christmas,"" she said, ""I kind of lost you. Sometimes I would know where you were, for a few hours, for a few days. You'd be all over. Then you'd fade away again.""
""I was in this town,"" he said. ""Lakeside. It's a good little town.""
""Oh,"" she said.
She no longer wore the blue dress in which she had been buried. Now she wore several sweaters, a long, dark, skirt, and burgundy boots. Shadow commented on them.
Laura ducked her head. She smiled. ""Aren't they great boots? I found them in this great shoe store in Chicago.""
""So what made you decide to come up from Chicago?""
""Oh, I've not been in Chicago for a while, puppy. I was heading south. The cold was bothering me. You'd think I'd welcome it. But it's something to do with being dead, I guess. You don't feel it as cold. You feel it as a sort of nothing, and when you're dead I guess the only thing that you're scared of is nothing. I was going to go to Texas. I planned to spend the winter in Galveston. I think I used to winter in Galveston, when I was a kid.""
""I don't think you did,"" said Shadow. ""You've never mentioned it before.""
""No? Maybe it was someone else, then. I don't know. I remember seagulls-throwing bread in the air for seagulls, hundreds of them, the whole sky becoming nothing but seagulls as they flapped their wings and snatched the bread from the air."" She paused. ""If I didn't see it, I guess someone else did.""
A car came around the corner. The driver waved them hello. Shadow waved back. It felt wonderfully normal to walk with his wife.
""This feels good,"" said Laura, as if she was reading his mind.
""Yes,"" said Shadow.
""I'm pleased it feels good for you, too. When the call came I had to hurry back. I was barely into Texas.""
""Call?""
She looked up at him. Around her neck the gold coin glinted. ""It felt like a call,"" she said. ""I started to think about you, about how much more fun I would have with you than down in Galveston. About how much I needed to see you. It was like a hunger.""
""You knew I was here, then?""
""Yes."" She stopped. She frowned, and her upper teeth pressed into her blue lower lip, biting it gently. She put her head on one side and said, ""I did. Suddenly, I did. I thought you were calling me, but it wasn't you, was it?""
""No.""
""You didn't want to see me.""
""It wasn't that."" He hesitated. ""No. I didn't want to see you. It hurts too much.""
The snow crunched beneath their feet and it glittered diamonds as the sunlight caught it.
""It must be hard,"" said Laura, ""not being alive.""
""You mean it's hard for you to be dead? Look, I'm still going to figure out how to bring you back, properly. I think I'm on the right track-""
""No,"" she said. ""I mean, I'm grateful. And I hope you really can do it. I did a lot of bad stuff..."" She shook her head. ""But I was talking about you.""
""I'm alive,"" said Shadow. ""I'm not dead. Remember?""
""You're not dead,"" she said. ""But I'm not sure that you're alive, either. Not really.""
This isn't the way this conversation goes, thought Shadow. This isn't the way anything goes.
""I love you,"" she said, dispassionately. ""You're my puppy. But when you're really dead you get to see things clearer. It's like there isn't anyone there. You know? You're like this big, solid, man-shaped hole in the world."" She frowned. ""Even when we were together. I loved being with you because you adored me, and you would do anything for me. But sometimes I'd go into a room and I wouldn't think there was anybody in there. And I'd turn the light on, or I'd turn the light off, and I'd realize that you were in there, sitting on your own, not reading, not watching TV, not doing anything.""
She hugged him then, as if to take the sting from her words, and she said, ""The best thing about Robbie was that he was somebody. He was a jerk sometimes, and he could be a joke, and he loved to have mirrors around when we made love so he could watch himself fucking me, but he was alive, puppy. He wanted things. He filled the space."" She stopped, looked up at him, tipped her head a little to one side. ""I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?""
He did not trust his voice not to betray him, so he simply shook his head.
""Good,"" she said. ""That's good.""
They were approaching the rest area where he had parked his car. Shadow felt that he needed to say something: I love you, or please don't go, or I'm sorry. The kind of words you use to patch a conversation that had lurched, without warning, into the dark places. Instead he said, ""I'm not dead.""
""Maybe not,"" she said. ""But are you sure you're alive?""
""Look at me,"" he said.
""That's not an answer,"" said his dead wife. ""You'll know it, when you are.""
""What now?"" he said.
""Well,"" she said, ""I've seen you now. I'm going south again.""
""Back to Texas?""
""Somewhere warm. I don't care.""
""I have to wait here,"" said Shadow. ""Until my boss needs me.""
""That's not living,"" said Laura. She sighed; and then she smiled, the same smile that had been able to tug at his heart no matter how many times he saw it. Every time she smiled at him had been the first time all over again.
""Will I see you again?""
She looked up at him and she stopped smiling. ""I guess so,"" she said. ""In the end. Nothing's finished, yet, is it?""
""No,"" he said. ""It's not.""
He went to put his arm around her, but she shook her head and pulled out of his reach. She sat down on the edge of a snow-covered picnic table, and she watched him drive away.

INTERLUDE 
The war had begun and nobody saw it. The storm was lowering and nobody knew it.
Wars are being fought all the time, with the world outside no more the wiser: the war on crime, the war on poverty, the war on drugs. This war was smaller than those, and huger, and more selective, but it was as real as any.
A falling girder in Manhattan closed a street for two days. It killed two pedestrians, an Arabic taxi-driver and the taxi-driver's passenger.
A trucker in Denver was found dead in his home. The murder instrument, a rubber-gripped claw-headed hammer, had been left on the floor beside his corpse. His face was untouched, but the back of his head was completely destroyed, and several words in a foreign alphabet were written on the bathroom mirror in brown lipstick.
In a postal sorting station in Phoenix, Arizona, a man went crazy, went postal as they said on the evening news, and shot Terry ""The Troll"" Evensen, a morbidly obese, awkward man who lived alone in a trailer. Several other people in the sorting station were fired on, but only Evensen was killed. The man who fired the shots-first thought to be a disgruntled postal worker-was not caught, and was never identified.
""Frankly,"" said Terry ""The Troll"" Evensen's supervisor, on the News at Five, ""if anyone around here was gonna go postal, we would have figured it was gonna be The Troll. Okay worker, but a weird guy. I mean, you never can tell, huh?""
That interview was cut when the segment was repeated, later that evening.
A community of nine anchorites in Montana was found dead. Reporters speculated that it was a mass suicide, but soon the cause of death was reported as carbon monoxide poisoning from an elderly furnace.
A lobster tank was smashed in the lobby of an Atlanta seafood restaurant.
A crypt was defiled in the Key West graveyard.
An Amtrak passenger train hit a UPS truck in Idaho, killing the driver of the truck. No passengers were seriously injured.
It was still a cold war at this stage, a phony war, nothing that could be truly won or lost.
The wind stirred the branches of the tree. Sparks flew from the fire. The storm was coming.
  
The Queen of Sheba, half-demon, they said, on her father's side, witch-woman, wise-woman and queen, who ruled Sheba when Sheba was the richest land there ever was, when its spices and its gems and scented woods were taken by boat and camel-back to the corners of the earth, who was worshiped even when she was alive, worshiped as a living goddess by the wisest of kings, stands on the sidewalk of Sunset Boulevard at 2:00 A.M. staring blankly out at the traffic like a slutty plastic bride on a black and neon wedding cake. She stands as if she owns the sidewalk and the night that surrounds her.
When someone looks straight at her, her lips move, as if she is talking to herself. When men in cars drive past her she makes eye-contact and she smiles. She ignores the men who walk past her on the sidewalk (it happens, people walk everywhere, even in West Hollywood); she ignores them, does her best to pretend that they are not there.
It's been a long night.
It's been a long week, and a long four thousand years.
She is proud that she owes nothing to anyone. The other girls on the street, they have pimps, they have habits, they have children, they have people who take what they make. Not her.
There is nothing holy left in her profession. Not any more.
A week ago the rains began in Los Angeles, slicking the streets into road accidents, crumbling the mud from the hillsides and toppling houses into canyons, washing the world into the gutters and storm drains, drowning the bums and the homeless camped down in the concrete channel of the river. When the rains come in Los Angeles they always take people by surprise.
Bilquis has spent the last week inside. Unable to stand on the sidewalk, she has curled up in her bed in the room the color of raw liver, listening to the rain pattering on the metal box of the window air conditioner and placing personals on the Internet. She has left her invitations on Adultfriendfinder.com, LA-escorts.com, Classyhollywoodbabes.com, has given herself an anonymous e-mail address. She was proud of herself for negotiating the new territories, but remains nervous-she has spent a long time avoiding anything that might resemble a paper trail. She has never even taken a small ad in the back pages of the LA Weekly, preferring to pick out her own customers, to find by eye and smell and touch the ones who will worship her as she needs to be worshiped, the ones who will let her take them all the way...
And it occurs to her now, standing and shivering on the street corner (for the late February rains have left off, but the chill they brought with them remains), that she has a habit as bad as that of the smack whores and the crack whores, and this distresses her, and her lips begin to move again. If you were close enough to her ruby-red lips you would hear her say,
""I will rise now and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek the one I love."" She is whispering that, and she whispers, ""I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine. He said, this stature of mine is like to a palm tree, and my breasts like clusters of grapes. He said he would come to me then. I am my beloved's and his desire is only toward me.""
Bilquis hopes that the break in the rains will bring the johns back. Most of the year she walks the two or three blocks on Sunset, enjoying the cool L.A. nights. Once a month she pays off a man named Sabbah, an officer in the LAPD, who replaced another officer in the LAPD she used to pay off, who had vanished. That man's name was Jerry LeBec, and his disappearance had been a mystery to the LAPD. He had become obsessed with Bilquis, had taken to following her on foot, and one afternoon she woke, startled by a noise, and opened the door to her apartment, and found Jerry LeBec in civilian clothes kneeling and swaying on the worn carpet, his head bowed, waiting for her to come out. The noise she had heard was the noise of his head, thumping against her door as he rocked back and forth on his knees.
She stroked his hair and told him to come inside, and later she put his clothes into a black plastic garbage bag and tossed them into a Dumpster behind a hotel several blocks away. His gun and his wallet she put into a grocery store bag. She poured used coffee grounds and food waste on top of them, folded the top of the bag and dropped it into a trashcan at a bus-stop.
She kept no souvenirs.
The orange night-sky glimmers to the west with distant lightning, somewhere out to sea, and Bilquis knows that the rain will be starting soon. She sighs. She does not want to be caught in the rain. She will return to her apartment, she decides, and take a bath, and shave her legs, it seems to her she is always shaving her legs, and sleep.
""By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth,"" she whispers. ""Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth. My beloved is mine and I am his.""
She begins to walk up a side-street, walking up the hillside to where her car is parked.
Headlights come up behind her, slowing as they approach her, and she turns her face to the street and smiles. The smile freezes when she sees the car is a white stretch limo. Men in stretch limos want to fuck in stretch limos, not in the privacy of Bilquis's shrine. Still, it might be an investment. Something for the future.
A tinted window hums down and Bilquis walks over to the limo, smiling. ""Hey, honey,"" she says. ""You looking for something?""
""Sweet loving,"" says a voice from the back of the stretch. She peers inside, as much as she can through the open window: she knows a girl who got into a stretch with five drunk football players and got hurt real bad, but there's only one john in there that she can see, and he looks kind of on the young side. He doesn't feel like a worshiper, but money, good money that's passed from his hand to hers, that's an energy in its own right-baraka they called it, once on a time-which she can use and frankly these days, every little helps.
""How much?"" he asks.
""Depends on what you want and how long you want it for,"" she says. ""And whether you can afford it."" She can smell something smoky drifting out of the limo window. It smells like burning wires and overheating circuit boards. The door is pushed open from inside.
""I can pay for anything I want,"" says the john. She leans into the car and looks around. There's nobody else in there, just the john, a puffy-faced kid who doesn't even look old enough to drink. Nobody else, so she gets in.
""Rich kid, huh?"" she says.
""Richer than rich,"" he tells her, edging along the leather seat towards her. He moves awkwardly. She smiles at him.
""Mm. Makes me hot, honey,"" she tells him. ""You must be one of them dot-coms I read about?""
He preens then, puffs like a bullfrog. ""Yeah. Among other things. I'm a technical boy."" The car moves off.
""So,"" he says. ""Tell me, Bilquis, how much just to suck my cock?""
""What you call me?""
""Bilquis,"" he says, again. And then he sings, in a voice not made for singing, ""You are an immaterial girl living in a material world."" There is something rehearsed about his words, as if he's practiced this exchange in front of a mirror.
She stops smiling, and her face changes, becomes wiser, sharper, harder. ""What do you want?""
""I told you. Sweet loving.""
""I'll give you whatever you want,"" she says. She needs to get out of the limo. It's moving too fast for her to throw herself from the car, she figures, but she'll do it if she can't talk her way out of this. Whatever's happening here, she doesn't like it.
""What I want. Yes."" He pauses. His tongue runs over his lips. ""I want a clean world. I want to own tomorrow. I want evolution, devolution, and revolution. I want to move our kind from the fringes of the slipstream to the higher ground of the mainstream. You people are underground. That's wrong. We need to take the spotlight and shine. Front and center. You people have been so far underground for so long you've lost the use of your eyes.""
""My name's Ayesha,"" she says. ""I don't know what you're talking about. There's another girl on that corner, her name Bilquis. We could go back to Sunset, you could have both of us...""
""Oh, Bilquis,"" he says, and he sighs, theatrically. ""There's only so much belief to go around. They're reaching the end of what they can give us. The credibility gap."" And then he sings, once again, in his tuneless nasal voice, ""You are an analog girl, living in a digital world."" The limo takes a corner too fast, and he tumbles across the seat into her. The driver of the car is hidden behind tinted glass. An irrational conviction strikes her, that nobody is driving the car, that the white limo is driving through Beverly Hills like Herbie the Love Bug, under its own power.
Then the john reaches out his hand and taps on the tinted glass.
The car slows, and before it has stopped moving Bilquis has pushed open the door and she half-jumps, half-falls out onto the blacktop. She's on a hillside road. To the left of her is a steep hill, to the right is a sheer drop. She starts to run down the road.
The limo sits there, unmoving.
It starts to rain, and her high heels slip and twist beneath her. She kicks them off and runs, soaked to the skin, looking for somewhere she can get off the road. She's scared. She has power, true, but it's hunger-magic, cunt-magic. It has kept her alive in this land for so long, true, but for everything else that's not simply living she uses her sharp eyes and her mind, her height and her presence.
There's a metal guard-rail at knee-height on her right, to stop cars from tumbling over the side of the hill, and now the rain is running down the hill-road turning it into a river, and the soles of her feet have started to bleed.
The lights of L.A. are spread out in front of her, a twinkling electrical map of an imaginary kingdom, the heavens laid out right here on earth, and she knows that all she needs to be safe is to get off the road.
I am black but comely, she mouths to the night and the rain. I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.
A fork of lightning burns greenly across the night sky. She loses her footing, slides several feet, skinning her leg and elbow, and she is getting to her feet when she sees the lights of the car descending the hill toward her. It's coming down too fast for safety and she wonders whether to throw herself to the right, where it could crush her against the hillside, or the left, where she might tumble down the gully, and she runs across the road, intending to push herself up the wet earth, to climb, when the white stretch limo comes fishtailing down the slick hillside road, hell it must be doing eighty, maybe even aquaplaning on the surface of the road, and she's pushing her hands into a handful of weeds and earth, and she's going to get up and away, she knows, when the wet earth crumbles and she tumbles back down onto the road.
The car hits her with an impact that crumples the grille and tosses her into the air like a glove puppet. She lands on the road behind the limo, and the impact shatters her pelvis, fractures her skull. Cold rainwater runs over her face.
She begins to curse her killer: curse him silently, as she cannot move her lips. She curses him in waking and in sleeping, in living and in death. She curses him as only someone who is half-demon on her father's side can curse.
A car door opens. Someone approaches her. ""You were an analog girl,"" he sings again, tunelessly, ""living in a digital world."" And then he says, ""You fucking madonnas. All you fucking madonnas."" He walks away.
The car door slams.
The limo reverses, and runs back over her, slowly, for the first time. Her bones crunch beneath the wheels. Then the limo comes back down the hill toward her.
When, finally, it drives away, down the hill, all it leaves behind on the road is the smeared red meat of roadkill, barely recognizable as human, and soon even that will be washed away by the rain.

INTERLUDE 2 
""Hi, Samantha.""
""Mags? Is that you?""
""Who else? Leon said that Auntie Sammy called when I was in the shower.""
""We had a good talk. He's such a sweet kid.""
""Yeah. I think I'll keep him.""
A moment of discomfort for both of them, barely a crackle of a whisper over the telephone lines. Then, ""Sammy, how's school?""
""They're giving us a week off. Problem with the furnaces. How are things in your neck of the Northwoods?""
""Well, I've got a new next-door neighbor. He does coin tricks. The Lakeside News letter column currently features a blistering debate on the potential rezoning of the town land down by the old cemetery on the southeast shore of the lake and yours truly has to write a strident editorial summarizing the paper's position on this without offending anybody or in fact giving anyone any idea what our position is.""
""Sounds like fun.""
""It's not. Alison McGovern vanished last week-Jilly and Stan McGovern's oldest. I don't think you met them. Nice kid. She babysat for Leon a few times.""
A mouth opens to say something, and it closes again, leaving whatever it was to say unsaid, and instead it says, ""That's awful.""
""Yes.""
""So..."" And there's nothing to follow that with that isn't going to hurt, so she says, ""Is he cute?""
""Who?""
""The neighbor.""
""His name's Ainsel. Mike Ainsel. He's okay. Too young for me. Big guy, looks...what's the word. Begins with an M.""
""Mean? Moody? Magnificent? Married?""
A short laugh, then, ""Yes, I guess he does look married. I mean, if there's a look that married men have, he kind of has it. But the word I was thinking of was melancholy. He looks melancholy.""
""And mysterious?""
""Not particularly. When he moved in he seemed kinda helpless-he didn't even know to heat-seal the windows. These days he still looks like he doesn't know what he's doing here. When he's here-he's here, then he's gone again. I've seen him out walking from time to time. He's no trouble.""
""Maybe he's a bank robber.""
""Uh-huh. Just what I was thinking.""
""You were not. That was my idea. Listen, Mags, how are you? Are you okay?""
""Yeah.""
""Really?""
""No.""
A long pause then. ""I'm coming up to see you.""
""Sammy, no.""
""It'll be after the weekend before the furnaces are working and school starts again. It'll be fun. You can make up a bed on the couch for me. And invite the mysterious neighbor over for dinner one night.""
""Sam, you're matchmaking.""
""Who's matchmaking? After Claudine-the-bitch-from-hell, maybe I'm ready to go back to boys for a while. I met a nice strange boy when I hitchhiked down to El Paso for Christmas.""
""Oh. Look, Sam, you've got to stop hitchhiking.""
""How do you think I'm going to get to Lakeside?""
""Alison McGovern was hitchhiking. Even in a town like this, it's not safe. I'll wire you the money. You can take the bus.""
""I'll be fine.""
""Sammy.""
""Okay, Mags. Wire me the money if it'll let you sleep easier.""
""You know it will.""
""Okay, bossy big sister. Give Leon a hug and tell him Auntie Sammy's coming up and he's not to hide his toys in her bed this time.""
""I'll tell him. I don't promise it'll do any good. So when should I expect you?""
""Tomorrow night. You don't have to meet me at the bus station-I'll ask Hinzelmann to run me over in Tessie.""
""Too late. Tessie's in mothballs for the winter. But Hinzelmann will give you a ride anyway. He likes you. You listen to his stories.""
""Maybe you should get Hinzelmann to write your editorial for you. Let's see. On the Rezoning of the Land by the Old Cemetery, it so happens that in the winter of ought three my grampaw shot a stag down by the old cemetery by the lake. He was out of bullets, so he used a cherry-stone from the lunch my grandmama had packed for him. Creased the skull of the stag and it shot off like a bat out of heck. Two years later he was down that way and he sees this mighty buck with a spreading cherry tree growing between its antlers. Well, he shot it, and grandmama made cherry pies enough that they were still eating them come the next Fourth of July...""
And they both laughed, then.

""The sign says 'help wanted.'""
""We're always hiring.""
""I can only work the night shift. Is that going to be a problem?""
""Shouldn't be. I can get you an application to fill out. You ever worked in a gas station before?""
""No. I figure, how hard can it be?""
""Well, it ain't rocket science, that's for sure.""
""I'm new here. I don't have a telephone. Waiting for them to put it in.""
""I surely know that one. I surely do. They just make you wait because they can. You know, ma'am, you don't mind my saying this, but you do not look well.""
""I know. It's a medical condition. Looks worse than it is. Nothing life-threatening.""
""Okay. You leave that application with me. We are really shorthanded on the late shift right now. Round here we call it the zombie shift. You do it too long, that's how you feel. Well now...is that Larna?""
""Laura.""
""Laura. Okay. Well, I hope you don't mind dealing with weirdos. Because they come out at night.""
""I'm sure they do. I can cope.""

Hey, old friend.
What do you say, old friend?
Make it okay, old friend,
Give an old friendship a break.
Why so grim? We're going on forever.
You, me, him-too many lives are at stake...
-STEPHEN SONDHEIM, ""OLD FRIENDS"" 
It was Saturday morning. Shadow answered the door.
Marguerite Olsen was there. She did not come in, just stood there in the sunlight, looking serious. ""Mister Ainsel...?""
""Mike, please,"" said Shadow.
""Mike, yes. Would you like to come over for dinner tonight? About six-ish? It won't be anything exciting, just spaghetti and meatballs.""
""Not a problem. I like spaghetti and meatballs.""
""Obviously, if you have any other plans...""
""I have no other plans.""
""Six o'clock.""
""Should I bring flowers?""
""If you must. But this is a social gesture. Not a romantic one."" She closed the door behind her.
He showered. He went for a short walk, down to the bridge and back. The sun was up, a tarnished quarter in the sky, and he was sweating in his coat by the time he got home. It had to be above freezing. He drove the 4Runner down to Dave's Finest Foods and bought a bottle of wine. It was a twenty-dollar bottle, which seemed to Shadow like some kind of guarantee of quality. He didn't know wines, but he figured that for twenty bucks it ought to taste good. He bought a Californian Cabernet, because Shadow had once seen a bumper sticker, back when he was younger and people still had bumper stickers on their cars, which said LIFE IS A CABERNET and it had made him laugh.
He bought a plant in a pot as a gift. Green leaves, no flowers. Nothing remotely romantic about that.
He bought a carton of milk, which he would never drink, and a selection of fruit, which he would never eat.
Then he drove over to Mabel's and bought a single lunchtime pasty. Mabel's face lit up when she saw him. ""Did Hinzelmann catch up with you?""
""I didn't know he was looking for me.""
""Yup. Wants to take you ice-fishing. And Chad Mulligan wanted to know if I'd seen you around. His cousin's here from out of state. She's a widow. His second cousin, what we used to call kissing cousins. Such a sweetheart. You'll love her."" And she dropped the pasty into a brown paper bag, twisted the top of the bag over to keep the pasty warm.
Shadow drove the long way home, eating one-handed, the steaming pasty's pastry-crumbs tumbling onto his jeans and onto the floor of the 4Runner. He passed the library on the south shore of the lake. It was a black and white town in the ice and the snow. Spring seemed unimaginably far away: the klunker would always sit on the ice, with the ice-fishing shelters and the pickup trucks and the snowmobile tracks.
He reached his apartment, parked, walked up the drive, up the wooden steps to his apartment. The goldfinches and nuthatches on the bird feeder hardly gave him a glance. He went inside. He watered the plant, wondered whether or not to put the wine into the refrigerator.
There was a lot of time to kill until six.
Shadow wished he could comfortably watch television once more. He wanted to be entertained, not to have to think, just to sit and let the sounds and the light wash over him. Do you want to see Lucy's tits? something with a Lucy voice whispered in his memory, and he shook his head, although there was no one there to see him.
He was nervous, he realized. This would be his first real social interaction with other people-normal people, not people in jail, not gods or culture heroes or dreams-since he was first arrested, over three years ago. He would have to make conversation, as Mike Ainsel.
He checked his watch. It was two-thirty. Marguerite Olsen had told him to be there at six. Did she mean six exactly? Should he be there a little early? A little late? He decided, eventually, to walk next door at five past six.
Shadow's telephone rang.
""Yeah?"" he said.
""That's no way to answer the phone,"" growled Wednesday.
""When I get my telephone connected I'll answer it politely,"" said Shadow. ""Can I help you?""
""I don't know,"" said Wednesday. There was a pause. Then he said, ""Organizing gods is like herding cats into straight lines. They don't take naturally to it."" There was a deadness, and an exhaustion, in Wednesday's voice that Shadow had never heard before.
""What's wrong?""
""It's hard. It's too fucking hard. I don't know if this is going to work. We might as well cut our throats. Just cut our own throats.""
""You mustn't talk like that.""
""Yeah. Right.""
""Well, if you do cut your throat,"" said Shadow, trying to jolly Wednesday out of his darkness, ""maybe it wouldn't even hurt.""
""It would hurt. Even for my kind, pain still hurts. If you move and act in the material world, then the material world acts on you. Pain hurts, just as greed intoxicates and lust burns. We may not die easy and we sure as hell don't die well, but we can die. If we're still loved and remembered, something else a whole lot like us comes along and takes our place and the whole damn thing starts all over again. And if we're forgotten, we're done.""
Shadow did not know what to say. He said, ""So where are you calling from?""
""None of your goddamn business.""
""Are you drunk?""
""Not yet. I just keep thinking about Thor. You never knew him. Big guy, like you. Good hearted. Not bright, but he'd give you the goddamned shirt off his back if you asked him. And he killed himself. He put a gun in his mouth and blew his head off in Philadelphia in 1932. What kind of a way is that for a god to die?""
""I'm sorry.""
""You don't give two fucking cents, son. He was a whole lot like you. Big and dumb."" Wednesday stopped talking. He coughed.
""What's wrong?"" said Shadow, for the second time.
""They got in touch.""
""Who did?""
""The opposition.""
""And?""
""They want to discuss a truce. Peace talks. Live and let fucking live.""
""So what happens now?""
""Now I go and drink bad coffee with the modern assholes in a Kansas City Masonic hall.""
""Okay. You going to pick me up, or shall I meet you somewhere?""
""You stay there and you keep your head down. Don't get into any trouble. You hear me?""
""But-""
There was a click, and the line went dead and stayed dead. There was no dial tone, but then, there never was.
Nothing but time to kill. The conversation with Wednesday had left Shadow with a sense of disquiet. He got up, intending to go for a walk, but already the light was fading, and he sat back down again.
Shadow picked up the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council 1872-1884 and turned the pages, his eyes scanning the tiny print, not actually reading it, occasionally scanning something that caught his eye.
In July of 1874, Shadow learned, the city council was concerned about the number of itinerant foreign loggers arriving in the town. An opera house was to be built on the corner of Third Street and Broadway. It was to be expected that the nuisances attendant to the damming of Mill Creek would abate once the mill-pond had become a lake. The council authorized the payment of seventy dollars to Mr. Samuel Samuels, and of eighty-five dollars to Mr. Heikki Salminen, in compensation for their land and for the expenses incurred in moving their domiciles out of the area to be flooded.
It had never occurred to Shadow before that the lake was man-made. Why call a town Lakeside, when the lake had begun as a dammed mill-pond? He read on, to discover that a Mr. Hinzelmann, originally of Hüdemuhlen in Brunswick, was in charge of the lake-building project, and that the city council had granted him the sum of $370 toward the project, any shortfall to be made up by public subscription. Shadow tore off a strip of a paper towel and placed it into the book as a bookmark. He could imagine Hinzelmann's pleasure in seeing the reference to his grandfather. He wondered if the old man knew that his family had been instrumental in building the lake. Shadow flipped forward through the book, scanning for more references to the lake-building project.
They had dedicated the lake in a ceremony in the spring of 1876, as a precursor to the town's centennial celebrations. A vote of thanks to Mr. Hinzelmann was taken by the council.
Shadow checked his watch. It was five thirty. He went into the bathroom, shaved, combed his hair. He changed his clothes. Somehow the final fifteen minutes passed. He got the wine and the plant, and he walked next door.
The door opened as he knocked. Marguerite Olsen looked almost as nervous as he felt. She took the wine bottle and the potted plant, and said thank you. The television was on, The Wizard of Oz on video. It was still in sepia, and Dorothy was still in Kansas, sitting with her eyes closed in Professor Marvel's wagon as the old fraud pretended to read her mind, and the twister-wind that would tear her away from her life was approaching. Leon sat in front of the screen, playing with a toy fire truck. When he saw Shadow an expression of delight touched his face; he stood up and ran, tripping over his feet in his excitement, into a back bedroom, from which he emerged a moment later, triumphantly waving a quarter.
""Watch, Mike Ainsel!"" he shouted. Then he closed both his hands and he pretended to take the coin into his right hand, which he opened wide. ""I made it disappear, Mike Ainsel!""
""You did,"" agreed Shadow. ""After we've eaten, if it's okay with your mom, I'll show you how to do it even smoother than that.""
""Do it now if you want,"" said Marguerite. ""We're still waiting for Samantha. I sent her out for sour cream. I don't know what's taking her so long.""
And, as if that was her cue, footsteps sounded on the wooden deck, and somebody shouldered open the front door. Shadow did not recognize her at first, then she said, ""I didn't know if you wanted the kind with calories or the kind that tastes like wallpaper paste so I went for the kind with calories,"" and he knew her then: the girl from the road to Cairo.
""That's fine,"" said Marguerite. ""Sam, this is my neighbor, Mike Ainsel. Mike, this is Samantha Black Crow, my sister.""
I don't know you, thought Shadow desperately. You've never met me before. We're total strangers. He tried to remember how he had thought snow, how easy and light that had been: this was desperate. He put out his hand and said, ""Pleased to meetcha.""
She blinked, looked up at his face. A moment of puzzlement, then recognition entered her eyes and curved the corners of her mouth into a grin. ""Hello,"" she said.
""I'll see how the food is doing,"" said Marguerite, in the taut voice of someone who burns things in kitchens if they leave them alone and unwatched even for a moment.
Sam took off her puffy coat and her hat. ""So you're the melancholy but mysterious neighbor,"" she said. ""Who'da thunk it?"" She kept her voice down.
""And you,"" he said, ""are girl Sam. Can we talk about this later?""
""If you promise to tell me what's going on.""
""Deal.""
Leon tugged at the leg of Shadow's pants. ""Will you show me now?"" he asked, and held out his quarter.
""Okay,"" said Shadow. ""But if I show you, you have to remember that a master magician never tells anyone how it's done.""
""I promise,"" said Leon, gravely.
Shadow took the coin in his left hand, then moved Leon's right hand in, cupping it in his own hand, huge by comparison, showing him how to appear to take the coin in his right hand while actually leaving it in Shadow's left hand. Then he put the coin into Leon's left hand and made him repeat the movements on his own.
After several attempts the boy mastered the move. ""Now you know half of it,"" said Shadow. ""Because the moves are only half of it. The other half is this: put your attention on the place where the coin ought to be. Look at the place it's meant to be. Follow it with your eyes. If you act like it's in your right hand, no one will even look at your left hand, no matter how clumsy you are.""
Sam watched all this with her head tipped slightly on one side, saying nothing.
""Dinner!"" called Marguerite, pushing her way in from the kitchen with a steaming bowl of spaghetti in her hands. ""Leon, go wash your hands.""
The food was good: crusty garlic bread, thick red sauce, good spicy meatballs. Shadow complimented Marguerite on it.
""Old family recipe,"" she told him, ""from the Corsican side of the family.""
""I thought you were Native American.""
""Dad's Cherokee,"" said Sam. ""Mag's mom's father came from Corsica."" Sam was the only person in the room who was actually drinking the Cabernet. ""Dad left her when Mags was ten and he moved across town. Six months after that, I was born. Mom and Dad got married when the divorce came through and I think they tried to make it work for a while, and when I was ten he went away. I think he has a ten-year attention span.""
""Well, he's been out in Oklahoma for ten years,"" said Marguerite.
""Now, my mom's family were European Jewish,"" continued Sam, ""from one of those places that used to be communist and now are just chaos. I think she liked the idea of being married to a Cherokee. Fry bread and chopped liver."" Sam took another sip of the red wine.
""Her mom's a wild woman,"" said Marguerite, semi-approvingly.
""You know where she is now?"" asked Sam. Shadow shook his head. ""She's in Australia. She met a guy on the Internet, who lived in Hobart. When they met in the flesh she decided he was actually kind of icky. But she really liked Tasmania. So she's living down there, with a woman's group, teaching them to batik cloth and things like that. Isn't that cool? At her age?""
Shadow agreed that it was, and helped himself to more meatballs. Sam told them how all the aboriginal natives of Tasmania had been wiped out by the British, and about the human chain they made across the island to catch them which trapped only an old man and a sick boy. She told him how the Tasmanian tigers, the thylacines, had been killed by farmers, scared for their sheep, how the politicians in the 1930s noticed that the thylacines should be protected only after the last of them was dead. She finished her second glass of wine, poured her third.
""So, Mike,"" said Sam, suddenly, her cheeks reddening, ""tell us about your family. What are the Ainsels like?"" She was smiling, and there was mischief in that smile.
""We're real dull,"" said Shadow. ""None of us ever got as far as Tasmania. So you're at school in Madison. What's that like?""
""You know,"" she said. ""I'm studying art history, women's studies, and casting my own bronzes.""
""When I grow up,"" said Leon, ""I'm going to do magic. Poof. Will you teach me, Mike Ainsel?""
""Sure,"" said Shadow. ""If your mom doesn't mind.""
Marguerite shrugged.
Sam said, ""After we've eaten, while you're putting Leon to bed, Mags, I think I'm going to get Mike to take me to the Buck Stops Here for an hour or so.""
Marguerite did not shrug. Her head moved, an eyebrow raised slightly.
""I think he's interesting,"" said Sam. ""And we have lots to talk about.""
Marguerite looked at Shadow, who busied himself in dabbing an imaginary blob of red sauce from his chin with a paper napkin. ""Well, you're grown-ups,"" she said, in a tone of voice that did its best to imply that they weren't, and that even if they were they shouldn't be.
After dinner Shadow helped Sam with the washing up-he dried-and then he did a trick for Leon, counting pennies into Leon's palm: each time Leon opened his hand and counted them there was one less coin than he had counted in. And as for the final penny-""Are you squeezing it? Tightly?""-when Leon opened his hand, he found it had transformed into a dime. Leon's plaintive cries of ""How'd you do that? Momma, how'd he do that?"" followed him out into the hall.
Sam handed him his coat. ""Come on,"" she said. Her cheeks were flushed from the wine.
Outside it was cold.
Shadow stopped in his apartment, tossed the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council into a plastic grocery bag and brought it along. Hinzelmann might be down at the Buck, and he wanted to show him the mention of his grandfather.
They walked down the drive side by side.
He opened the garage door, and she started to laugh. ""Omigod,"" she said, when she saw the 4Runner. ""Paul Gunther's car. You bought Paul Gunther's car. Omigod.""
Shadow opened the door for her. Then he went around and got in. ""You know the car?""
""When I came up here two or three years ago to stay with Mags. It was me that persuaded him to paint it purple.""
""Oh,"" said Shadow. ""It's good to have someone to blame.""
He drove the car out onto the street. Got out and closed the garage door. Got back into the car. Sam was looking at him oddly as he got in, as if the confidence had begun to leak out of her. He put on his seatbelt, and she said, ""I'm scared. This was a stupid thing to do, wasn't it? Getting into a car with a psycho-killer.""
""I got you safe home last time,"" said Shadow.
""You killed two men,"" she said. ""You're wanted by the Feds. And now I find out you're living under an assumed name next door to my sister. Unless Mike Ainsel is your real name?""
""No,"" said Shadow, and he sighed. ""It's not."" He hated saying it. It was if he was letting go of something important, abandoning Mike Ainsel by denying him, as if he were taking his leave of a friend.
""Did you kill those men?""
""No.""
""They came to my house, and said we'd been seen together. And this guy showed me photographs of you. What was his name-Mister Hat? No. Mister Town. That was him. It was like The Fugitive. But I said I hadn't seen you.""
""Thank you.""
""So,"" she said. ""Tell me what's going on. I'll keep your secrets if you keep mine.""
""I don't know any of yours,"" said Shadow.
""Well, you know that it was my idea to paint this thing purple, thus forcing Paul Gunther to become such an object of scorn and derision for several counties around that he was forced to leave town entirely. We were kind of stoned,"" she admitted.
""I doubt that bit of it's much of a secret,"" said Shadow. ""Everyone in Lakeside must have known. It's a stoner sort of purple.""
And then she said, very quiet, very fast, ""If you're going to kill me please don't hurt me. I shouldn't have come here with you. I am so dumb. I am so fucking fucking dumb. I should have run away or called the cops when I first saw you. I can identify you. Jesus. I am so dumb.""
Shadow sighed. ""I've never killed anybody. Really. Now I'm going to take you to the Buck,"" he said. ""Or if you give the word, I'll turn this car around and take you home. I'll buy you a drink, if you're actually old enough to drink, and I'll buy you a soda if you're not. Then I'll take you back to Marguerite, deliver you safe and sound, and hope you aren't going to call the cops.""
There was silence as they crossed the bridge.
""Who did kill those men?"" she asked.
""You wouldn't believe me if I told you.""
""I would."" She sounded angry now. He wondered if bringing the wine to the dinner had been a wise idea. Life was certainly not a Cabernet right now.
""It's not easy to believe.""
""I,"" she told him, ""can believe anything. You have no idea what I can believe.""
""Really?""
""I can believe things that are true and I can believe things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they're true or not. I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and Marilyn Monroe and the Beatles and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen-I believe that people are perfectible, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone's ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theatres from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped out by the common cold like the Martians in War of the Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind's destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to feed it it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe that life is a game, life is a cruel joke and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it."" She stopped, out of breath.
Shadow almost took his hands off the wheel to applaud. Instead he said, ""Okay. So if I tell you what I've learned you won't think that I'm a nut.""
""Maybe,"" she said. ""Try me.""
""Would you believe that all the gods that people have ever imagined are still with us today?""
""...maybe.""
""And that there are new gods out there, gods of computers and telephones and whatever, and that they all seem to think there isn't room for them both in the world. And that some kind of war is kind of likely.""
""And these gods killed those two men?""
""No, my wife killed those two men.""
""I thought you said your wife was dead.""
""She is.""
""She killed them before she died, then?""
""After. Don't ask.""
She reached up a hand and flicked her hair from her forehead.
They pulled up on Main Street, outside the Buck Stops Here. The sign over the window showed a surprised-looking stag standing on its hind legs holding a glass of beer. Shadow got out. He grabbed the bag with the book in it, and got out.
""Why would they have a war?"" asked Sam. ""It seems kind of redundant. What is there to win?""
""I don't know,"" admitted Shadow.
""It's easier to believe in aliens than in gods,"" said Sam. ""Maybe Mister Town and Mister Whatever were Men in Black, only the alien kind.""
""Maybe they were, at that,"" said Shadow.
They were standing on the sidewalk outside the Buck Stops Here and Sam stopped. She looked up at Shadow, and her breath hung on the night air like a faint cloud. She said, ""Just tell me you're one of the good guys.""
""I can't,"" said Shadow. ""I wish I could. But I'm doing my best.""
She looked up at him, and bit her lower lip. Then she nodded. ""Good enough,"" she said. ""I won't turn you in. You can buy me a beer.""
Shadow pushed the door open for her, and they were hit by a blast of heat and music, enveloped by a cloud of warmth that smelled of beer and hamburgers. They went inside.
Sam waved at some friends. Shadow nodded to a handful of people whose faces-although not their names-he remembered from the day he had spent searching for Alison McGovern, or who he had met in Mabel's in the morning. Chad Mulligan was standing at the bar, with his arm around the shoulders of a small red-haired woman-the kissing cousin, Shadow figured. He wondered what she looked like, but she had her back to him. Chad's hand raised in a mock salute when he saw Shadow. Shadow grinned, and waved back at him. Shadow looked around for Hinzelmann, but the old man did not seem to be there this evening. He spied a free table at the back and started walking toward it.
Then somebody began to scream.
It was a bad scream, a full-throated, seen-a-ghost hysterical scream, which silenced all conversation. Shadow looked around, certain somebody was being murdered, and then he realized that all the faces in the bar were turning toward him. Even the black cat, who slept in the window during the day, was standing up on top of the jukebox with its tail high and its back arched and was staring at Shadow.
Time slowed.
""Get him!"" shouted a woman's voice, parked on the verge of hysteria. ""Oh for god's sake, somebody stop him! Don't let him get away! Please!"" It was a voice he knew.
Nobody moved. They stared at Shadow. He stared back at them.
Chad Mulligan stepped forward, walking through the people. The small woman walked behind him warily, her eyes wide, as if she was preparing to start screaming once more. Shadow knew her. Of course he knew her.
Chad was still holding his beer, which he put down on a nearby table. He said, ""Mike.""
Shadow said ""Chad.""
Audrey Burton was a step behind Chad Mulligan. Her face was white, and there were tears in her eyes. She had been screaming. ""Shadow,"" she said. ""You bastard. You murderous evil bastard.""
""Are you sure that you know this man, hon?"" said Chad. He looked uncomfortable. It was obvious that he hoped that whatever was happening here was all some kind of case of mistaken identity, something that one day they might be able to laugh about.
Audrey Burton looked at him incredulously. ""Are you crazy? He worked for Robbie for years. His slutty wife was my best friend. He's wanted for murder. I had to answer questions. He's an escaped convict."" She was way over the top, her voice trembling with suppressed hysteria, sobbing out her words like a soap actress going for a daytime Emmy. Kissing cousins, thought Shadow, unimpressed.
Nobody in the bar said a word. Chad Mulligan looked up at Shadow. ""It's probably a mistake. I'm sure we can sort this all out,"" he said, sensibly. Then he said, to the bar, ""It's all fine. Nothing to worry about. We can sort this out. Everything's fine."" Then, to Shadow. ""Let's step outside, Mike."" Quiet competence. Shadow was impressed.
""Sure,"" said Shadow.
He felt a hand touch his hand, and he turned to see Sam staring at him. He smiled down at her as reassuringly as he could.
Sam looked at Shadow, then she looked around the bar at the faces staring at them. She said to Audrey Burton, ""I don't know who you are. But. You. Are. Such. A cunt."" Then she went up on tiptoes and pulled Shadow down to her, and kissed him hard on the lips, pushing her mouth against his for what felt to Shadow like several minutes, and might have been as long as five seconds in real, clock-ticking time.
It was a strange kiss, Shadow thought, as her lips pressed against his: it wasn't intended for him. It was for the other people in the bar, to let them know that she had picked sides. It was a flag-waving kiss. Even as she kissed him, he became certain that she didn't even like him-well, not like that.
Still, there was a tale he had read once, long ago, as a small boy: the story of a traveler who had slipped down a cliff, with man-eating tigers above him and a lethal fall below him, who managed to stop his fall halfway down the side of the cliff, holding on for dear life. There was a clump of strawberries beside him, and certain death above him and below. What should he do? went the question. And the reply was, Eat the strawberries.
The story had never made any sense to him as a boy. It did now.
So he closed his eyes, threw himself into the kiss and experienced nothing but Sam's lips and the softness of her skin against his, sweet as a wild strawberry.
""C'mon, Mike,"" said Chad Mulligan, firmly. ""Please. Let's take it outside.""
Sam pulled back. She licked her lips, and smiled, a smile that nearly reached her eyes. ""Not bad,"" she said. ""You kiss good for a boy. Okay, go play outside."" Then she turned to Audrey Burton. ""But you,"" she said, ""are still a cunt.""
Shadow tossed Sam his car keys. She caught them, one-handed. He walked through the bar, and stepped outside, followed by Chad Mulligan. A gentle snow had begun to fall, the flakes spinning down into the light of the neon bar sign. ""You want to talk about this?"" asked Chad.
""Am I under arrest?"" asked Shadow.
Audrey followed them out onto the sidewalk. She looked as if she were ready to start screaming again. She said, her voice trembling, ""He killed two men, Chad. The FBI came to my door. He's a psycho. I'll come down to the station with you, if you want.""
""You've caused enough trouble, ma'am,"" said Shadow. He sounded tired, even to himself. ""Please go away.""
""Chad? Did you hear that? He threatened me!"" said Audrey.
""Get back inside, Audrey,"" said Chad Mulligan. She looked as if she were about to argue, then she pressed her lips together so hard they went white, and went back into the bar.
""Would you like to comment on anything she said?"" asked Chad Mulligan.
""I've never killed anyone,"" said Shadow.
Chad nodded. ""I believe you,"" he said. ""I'm sure we can deal with these allegations easily enough. It's probably nothing. I have to do this. You won't give me any trouble, will you, Mike?""
""No trouble,"" said Shadow. ""This is all a mistake.""
""Exactly,"" said Chad. ""So I figure we ought to head down to my office and sort it all out there?""
""Am I under arrest?"" asked Shadow, for the second time.
""Nope,"" said Chad. ""Not unless you want to be. I figure, we go down to my office together, you come with me out of a sense of civic duty, and we do whatever we can to straighten all this out.""
Chad patted Shadow down, found no weapons. They got into Mulligan's car. Again Shadow sat in the back, looking out through the metal cage. He thought, SOS. Mayday. Help. He tried to push Mulligan with his mind, as he'd once pushed a cop in Chicago-This is your old friend Mike Ainsel. You saved his life. Don't you know how silly this is? Why don't you just drop the whole thing?
""I figure it was good to get you out of there,"" said Chad. ""All you needed was some loudmouth deciding that you were Alison McGovern's killer and we'd've had a lynch mob on our hands.""
""Point.""
""So you sure there's nothing you want to tell me?""
""Nope. Nothing to say.""
They were silent for the rest of the drive to the Lakeside police offices. The building, Chad said, as they pulled up outside it, actually belonged to the county sheriff's department. The local police had a few rooms in there. Pretty soon the county would build something modern. For now they had to make do with what they had.
They walked inside.
""Should I call a lawyer?"" asked Shadow.
""You aren't accused of anything,"" said Mulligan. ""Up to you."" They pushed through some swing doors. ""Take a seat over there.""
Shadow took a seat on the wooden chair with cigarette burns on the side. He felt stupid and numb. There was a small poster on the notice board, beside a large NO SMOKING sign: ENDANGERED MISSING it said. The photograph was Alison McGovern's.
There was a wooden table, with old copies of Sports Illustrated and Newsweek on it, with the place on the cover where an address label had been pasted cut neatly away. The light was bad. The paint on the wall was yellow, but it might once have been white.
After ten minutes Chad brought him a watery cup of vending machine hot chocolate. ""What's in the bag?"" he asked. And it was only then that Shadow realized he was still holding the plastic bag containing the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council.
""Old book,"" said Shadow. ""Your grandfather's picture's in here. Or great-grandfather maybe.""
""Yeah?""
Shadow flipped through the book until he found the portrait of the town council, and he pointed to the man called Mulligan. Chad chuckled. ""If that don't beat all,"" he said.
Minutes passed, and hours, in that room. Shadow read two of the Sports Illustrateds and he started the Newsweek. From time to time Chad would come through, checking to see if Shadow needed to use the restroom, once to offer him a ham roll and a small packet of potato chips.
""Thanks,"" said Shadow, taking them. ""Am I under arrest?""
Chad sucked the air between his teeth. ""Well,"" he said, ""we'll know pretty soon. It doesn't look like you came by the name Mike Ainsel legally. On the other hand, you can call yourself whatever you want in this state, if it's not for fraudulent purposes. You just hang loose.""
""Can I make a phone call?""
""Is it a local call?""
""Long-distance.""
""It'll save money if I put it on my calling card, otherwise you'll just be feeding ten bucks' worth of quarters into that thing in the hall.""
Sure, thought Shadow. And this way you'll know the number I dialed, and you'll probably be listening in on an extension.
""That would be great,"" said Shadow. They went into an empty office, next to Chad's. The light was slightly better in there. The number Shadow gave Chad to dial for him was that of a funeral home in Cairo, Illinois. Chad dialed it, handed Shadow the receiver. ""I'll leave you in here,"" he said, and went out.
The telephone rang several times, then it was picked up.
""Jacquel and Ibis. Can I help you?""
""Hi. Mister Ibis, this is Mike Ainsel. I helped out there for a few days over Christmas.""
A moment's hesitation, then, ""Of course. Mike. How are you?""
""Not great, Mister Ibis. In a patch of trouble. About to be arrested. Hoping you'd seen my uncle about, or maybe you could get a message to him.""
""I can certainly ask around. Hold on, uh, Mike. There's someone here who wishes a word with you.""
The phone was passed to somebody, and then a smoky female voice said, ""Hi, honey. I miss you.""
He was certain he'd never heard that voice before. But he knew her. He was sure that he knew her...
Let it go, the smoky voice whispered in his mind, in a dream. Let it all go.
""Who's that girl you were kissing, hon? You trying to make me jealous?""
""We're just friends,"" said Shadow. ""I think she was trying to prove a point. How did you know she kissed me?""
""I got eyes wherever my folk walk,"" she said. ""You take care now, hon..."" There was a moment of silence, then Mr. Ibis came back on the line and said, ""Mike?""
""Yes.""
""There's a problem getting hold of your uncle. He seems to be kind of tied up. But I'll try and get a message to your aunt Nancy. Best of luck."" The line went dead.
Shadow sat down, expecting Chad to return. He sat in the empty office, wishing he had something to distract him. Reluctantly, he picked up the Minutes once more, opened it to somewhere in the middle of the book, and began to read.
An ordinance prohibiting expectoration on sidewalks and on the floors of public buildings, or throwing thereon tobacco in any form, was introduced and passed, eight to four, in December of 1876.
Lemmi Hautala was twelve years old and had, ""it was feared, wandered away in a fit of delirium"" on December the thirteenth, 1876. ""A search being immediately effected, but impeded by the snows, which are blinding."" The council had voted unanimously to send the Hautala family their condolences.
The fire at Olsen's livery stables the following week was extinguished without any injury or loss of life, human or equine.
Shadow scanned the closely printed columns. He found no further mention of Lemmi Hautala.
And then, on something slightly more than a whim, he flipped the pages forward to the winter of 1877. He found what he was looking for mentioned as an aside in the January minutes: Jessie Lovat, age not given, ""a Negro child,"" had vanished on the night of the twenty-eighth of December. It was believed that she might have been ""abducted by traveling so-called pedlars, who were run out of town the previous week, having been discovered to be engaged in certain larcenous acts. They were said to be making for St. Paul."" Telegrams had been sent to St. Paul, but no results were reported. Condolences were not sent to the Lovat family.
Shadow was scanning the minutes of winter 1878 when Chad Mulligan knocked and entered, looking shamefaced, like a child bringing home a bad report card.
""Mister Ainsel,"" he said. ""Mike. I'm truly sorry about this. I appreciate how easy you've been about all this. Personally, I like you. But that don't change anything, you know?""
Shadow said he knew.
""I got no choice in the matter,"" said Chad, ""but to place you under arrest for violating your parole."" Then Police Chief Chad Mulligan read Shadow his rights. He filled out some paperwork. He took Shadow's prints. He walked him down the hall to the county jail, on the other side of the building.
There was a long counter and several doorways on one side of the room, two holding cells and a doorway on the other. One of the cells was occupied-a man slept on a cement bed under a thin blanket. The other was empty.
There was a sleepy-looking woman in a brown uniform behind the counter, watching Jay Leno on a small white portable television. She took the papers from Chad, and signed for Shadow. Chad hung around, filled in more papers. The woman came around the counter, patted Shadow down, took all his possessions-wallet, coins, front door key, book, watch-and put them on the counter, then gave him a plastic bag with orange clothes in it and told him to go into the open cell and change into them. He could keep his own underwear and socks. He went in and changed into the orange clothes and the shower footwear. It stank evilly in there. The orange top he pulled over his head had LUMBER COUNTY JAIL written on the back, in large black letters.
The metal toilet in the cell had backed up, and was filled to the brim with a brown stew of liquid feces and sour, beerish urine.
Shadow came back out, gave the woman his clothes, which she put into the plastic bag with the rest of his possessions. She had him sign for them. Shadow signed for them as Mike Ainsel, although he found that he was already thinking of Mike Ainsel as someone he had liked well enough in the past but would no longer be seeing in the future. He had thumbed through the wallet before he handed it over. ""You take care of this,"" he had said to the woman. ""My whole life is in here."" The woman took the wallet from him, and assured him that it would be safe with them. She asked Chad if that wasn't true, and Chad, looking up from the last of his paperwork, said Liz was telling the truth, they'd never lost a prisoner's possessions yet.
Shadow had slipped the four hundred-dollar bills that he had palmed from the wallet into his socks, when he had changed, along with the silver Liberty dollar he had palmed as he had emptied his pockets.
""Say,"" Shadow asked, when he came out. ""Would it be okay if I finished reading the book?""
""Sorry, Mike. Rules are rules,"" said Chad.
Liz put Shadow's possessions in a bag in the back room. Chad said he'd leave Shadow in Officer Bute's capable hands. Liz looked tired and unimpressed. Chad left. The telephone rang, and Liz-Officer Bute-answered it. ""Okay,"" she said. ""Okay. No problem. Okay. No problem. Okay."" She put down the phone and made a face.
""Problem?"" asked Shadow.
""Yes. Not really. Kinda. They're sending someone up from Milwaukee to collect you. Okay, do you have any history of medical problems, diabetes, anything like that?""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""Nothing like that. Why is that a problem?""
""Because I got to keep you in here with me for three hours,"" she said. ""And the cell over there""-she pointed to the cell by the door, with the sleeping man in it-""that's occupied. He's on suicide watch. I shouldn't put you in with him. But it's not worth the trouble to sign you in to the county and then sign you out again."" She shook her head. ""And you don't want to go in there""-she pointed to the empty cell in which he'd changed his clothes-""because the can is shot. It stinks in there, doesn't it?""
""Yes. It was gross.""
""It's common humanity, that's what it is. The sooner we get into the new facilities, it can't be too soon for me. One of the women we had in yesterday must've flushed a tampon away. I tell 'em not to. We got bins for that. They clog the pipes. Every damn tampon down that john costs the county a hundred bucks in plumbers' fees. So, I can keep you out here, if I cuff you. Or you can go in the cell."" She looked at him. ""Your call,"" she said.
""I'm not crazy about them,"" he said. ""But I'll take the cuffs.""
She took a pair from her utility belt, then patted the semi-automatic in its holster, as if to remind him that it was there. ""Hands behind your back,"" she said.
The cuffs were a tight fit: he had big wrists. Then she put hobbles on his ankles, and sat him down on a bench on the far side of the counter, against the wall. ""Now,"" she said. ""You don't bother me, and I won't bother you."" She tilted the television so that he could see it.
""Thanks,"" he said.
""When we get our new offices,"" she said, ""there won't be none of this nonsense.""
The Tonight Show finished. Jay and his guests grinned the world good night. An episode of Cheers began. Shadow had never really watched Cheers. He had only ever seen one episode of it-the one where Coach's daughter comes to the bar-although he had seen that several times. Shadow had noticed that you only ever catch one episode of shows you don't watch, over and over, years apart; he thought it must be some kind of cosmic law.
Officer Liz Bute sat back in her chair. She was not obviously dozing, but she was by no means awake, so she did not notice when the gang at Cheers stopped talking and getting off one-liners and just started staring out of the screen at Shadow.
Diane, the blonde barmaid who fancied herself an intellectual, was the first to talk. ""Shadow,"" she said. ""We were so worried about you. You'd fallen off the world. It's so good to see you again-albeit in bondage and orange couture.""
""What I figure, is, the thing to do,"" pontificated bar-bore Cliff, ""is to escape in hunting season, when everybody's wearing orange anyway.""
Shadow said nothing.
""Ah, cat got your tongue, I see,"" said Diane. ""Well, you've led us a merry chase!""
Shadow looked away. Officer Liz had begun, gently, to snore. Carla, the little waitress, snapped, ""Hey, jerk-wad! We interrupt this broadcast to show you something that's going to make you piss in your friggin' pants. You ready?""
The screen flickered and went black. The words ""LIVE FEED"" pulsated in white at the bottom left of the screen. A subdued female voice said, in voice-over, ""It's certainly not too late to change to the winning side. But you know, you also have the freedom to stay just where you are. That's what it means to be an American. That's the miracle of America. Freedom to believe means the freedom to believe the wrong thing, after all. Just as freedom of speech gives you the right to stay silent.""
The picture now showed a street scene. The camera lurched forward, in the manner of hand-held video cameras in real-life documentaries.
A man with thinning hair, a tan, and a faintly hangdog expression filled the frame. He was standing by a wall sipping a cup of coffee from a plastic cup. He looked into the camera and said, ""Terrorism is too easy a word to bandy about. It means that the real terrorists hide behind weasel-words, like freedom fighter, when they are murdering scum, pure and simple. It doesn't make our job any easier, but at least we know we're making a difference. We're risking our lives to make a difference.""
Shadow recognized the voice. He had been inside the man's head once. Mr. Town sounded different from inside-his voice was deeper, more resonant-but there was no mistaking it.
The cameras pulled back to show that Mr. Town was standing outside a brick building on an American street. Above the door was a set-square and compass framing the letter G.
""In position,"" said somebody off-screen.
""Let's see if the cameras inside the hall are working,"" said the female voice-over voice. It was the kind of reassuring voice they use on commercials to try to sell you things only people as smart as you are going to take this opportunity to buy.
The words LIVE FEED continued to blink at the bottom left of the screen. Now the picture showed the interior of a small hall: the room was underlit. Two men sat at a table at the far end of the room. One of them had his back to the camera. The camera zoomed in to them awkwardly, in a series of jagged movements. For a moment they were out of focus, and then they became sharp once more. The man facing the camera got up and began to pace, like a bear on a chain. It was Wednesday. He looked as if, on some level, he was enjoying this. As they came into focus the sound came on with a pop.
The man with his back to the screen was saying, ""-we are offering is the chance to end this, here and now, with no more bloodshed, no more aggression, no more pain, no more loss of life. Isn't that worth giving up a little?""
Wednesday stopped pacing and turned. His nostrils flared. ""First,"" he growled, ""you have to understand that you are asking me to speak for all of us, for each and every individual in my position across this country. Which is manifestly nonsensical. They will do what they will do, and I have no say in it. Secondly, what on earth makes you think that I believe that you people are going to keep your word?""
The man with his back to the camera moved his head. ""You do yourself an injustice,"" he said. ""Obviously you people have no leaders. But you're the one they listen to. They pay attention to you, Mister Cargo. And as for keeping my word, well, these preliminary talks are being filmed and broadcast live,"" and he gestured back toward the camera. ""Some of your people are watching as we speak. Others will see videotapes. Others will be told, by those they trust. The camera does not lie.""
""Everybody lies,"" said Wednesday.
Shadow recognized the voice of the man with his back to the camera. It was Mr. World, the one who had spoken to Town on the cell phone while Shadow was in Town's head.
""You don't believe,"" said Mr. World, ""that we will keep our word?""
""I think your promises were made to be broken and your oaths to be forsworn. But I will keep my word.""
""Safe conduct is safe conduct,"" said Mr. World, ""and a flag of truce is what we agreed. I should tell you, by the way, that your young protégé is once more in our custody.""
Wednesday snorted. ""No,"" he said. ""He's not.""
""We were discussing the ways to deal with the coming paradigm shift. We don't have to be enemies. Do we?""
Wednesday still seemed shaken. He said, ""I will do whatever is in my power...""
Shadow noticed something strange about the image of Wednesday on the television screen. A red glint burned on his left eye, the glass one. The eye burned with a scarlet light. The glint left a phosphor-dot after-image as he moved. Wednesday seemed unaware of it.
""It's a big country,"" said Wednesday, marshaling his thoughts. He moved his head and the scarlet glitter-blur slipped to his cheek, a red laser-pointer dot. Then it edged up to his glass eye once more. ""There is room for-""
There was a bang, muted by the television speakers, and the side of Wednesday's head exploded. His body tumbled backward.
Mr. World stood up, his back still to the camera, and walked out of shot.
""Let's see that again, in slow motion this time,"" said the announcer's voice, reassuringly.
The words LIVE FEED became REPLAY. Slowly now the red laser pointer traced its bead onto Wednesday's glass eye, and once again the side of his face dissolved into a cloud of blood. Freeze frame.
""Yes, it's still God's Own Country,"" said the announcer, a news reporter pronouncing the final tag line. ""The only question is, which gods?""
Another voice-Shadow thought that it was Mr. World's, it had that same half-familiar quality-said, ""We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.""
On Cheers Coach assured his daughter that she was truly beautiful, just like her mother.
The telephone rang, and Officer Liz sat up with a start. She picked it up. Said, ""Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay, I'll be over there,"" put the phone down and got up from behind the counter. She said to Shadow, ""Sorry. I'm going to have to put you in the cell. Don't use the can. If you need to go, press the buzzer by the door, and I'll come down as soon as I can and escort you to the restrooms out back. The Lafayette sheriff's department should be here to collect you soon.""
She removed the cuffs and the hobble, locked him into the holding cell. The smell was worse, now that the door was closed.
Shadow sat down on the concrete bed, slipped the Liberty dollar from his sock and began moving it from finger to palm, from position to position, from hand to hand, his only aim to keep the coin from being seen by anyone who might look in. He was passing the time. He was numb.
He missed Wednesday, then, sudden and deep. He missed the man's confidence, his attitude. His conviction.
He opened his hand, looked down at Lady Liberty, a silver profile. He closed his fingers over the coin, held it tightly. He wondered if he'd get to be one of those guys who got life for something they didn't do. If he even made it that far. From what he'd seen of Mr. World and Mr. Town, they would have little trouble pulling him out of the system. Perhaps he'd suffer an unfortunate accident on the way to the next holding facility. He could be shot while making a break for it. It did not seem at all unlikely.
There was a stir of activity in the room on the other side of the glass. Officer Liz came back in. She pressed a button, a door that Shadow could not see opened, and a black deputy in a brown sheriff's uniform entered and walked briskly over to the desk.
Shadow slipped the dollar coin back into his sock, pushing it down toward his ankle.
The new deputy handed over some papers, Liz scanned them and signed. Chad Mulligan came in, said a few words to the new man, then he unlocked the cell door and walked inside.
""It stinks in here.""
""Tell me about it.""
""Okay. Folk are here to pick you up. Seems you're a matter of national security. You know that?""
""It'll make a great front-page story for the Lakeside News,"" said Shadow.
Chad looked at him without expression. ""That a drifter got picked up for parole violations? Not much of a story.""
""So that's the way it is?""
""That's what they tell me,"" said Chad Mulligan. Shadow put his hands in front of him this time, and Chad cuffed him. Chad locked on the ankle hobbles, and a rod from the cuffs to the hobbles.
Shadow thought, They'll take me outside. Maybe I can make a break for it, some kind of break for it, in hobbles and cuffs and lightweight orange clothes, out into the snow, and even as he thought it he knew how stupid and hopeless it was.
Chad walked him out into the office. Liz had turned the TV off now. The black deputy looked him over. ""He's a big guy,"" he said to Chad. Liz passed the new deputy the paper bag with Shadow's possessions in it, and he signed for it.
Chad looked at Shadow, then at the deputy. He said to the deputy, quietly, but loudly enough for Shadow to hear, ""Look. I just want to say, I'm not comfortable with the way this is happening.""
The deputy nodded. His voice was deep, and cultured: the voice of a man who could as easily organize a press briefing as a massacre. ""You'll have to take it up with the appropriate authorities, sir. Our job is simply to bring him in.""
Chad made a sour face. He turned to Shadow. ""Okay,"" said Chad. ""Through that door and into the sally port.""
""What?""
""Out there. Where the car is.""
Liz unlocked the doors. ""You make sure that orange uniform comes right back here,"" she said to the deputy. ""The last felon we sent down to Lafayette, we never saw the uniform again. They cost the county money."" They walked Shadow out to the sally port, where a car was waiting. It wasn't a sheriff's-department car. It was a black town car. Another deputy, a grizzled white guy with a moustache, stood by the car, smoking a cigarette. He crushed it out underfoot as they came close, and opened the back door for Shadow.
Shadow sat down, awkwardly, his movements hampered by the cuffs and the hobble. There was no grille between the back and the front of the car.
The two deputies climbed into the front of the car. The black deputy started the motor. They waited for the sally port door to open.
""Come on, come on,"" said the black deputy, his fingers drumming against the steering wheel.
Chad Mulligan tapped on the side window. The white deputy glanced at the driver, then he lowered the window. ""This is wrong,"" said Chad. ""I just wanted to say that.""
""Your comments have been noted, and will be conveyed to the appropriate authorities,"" said the driver.
The doors to the outside world opened. The snow was still falling, dizzying into the car's headlights. The driver put his foot on the gas, and they were heading back down the street and onto Main Street.
""You heard about Wednesday?"" said the driver. His voice sounded different, now, older, and familiar. ""He's dead.""
""Yeah. I know,"" said Shadow. ""I saw it on TV.""
""Those fuckers,"" said the white officer. It was the first thing he had said, and his voice was rough and accented and, like the driver's, it was a voice that Shadow knew. ""I tell you, they are fuckers, those fuckers.""
""Thanks for coming to get me,"" said Shadow.
""Don't mention it,"" said the driver. In the light of an oncoming car his face already looked older. He looked smaller, too. The last time Shadow had seen him he had been wearing lemon-yellow gloves and a check jacket. ""We were in Milwaukee. Still had to drive like demons when Ibis called.""
""You think we let them lock you up and send you to the chair, when I'm still waiting to break your head with my hammer?"" asked the white deputy gloomily, fumbling in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes. His accent was east European.
""The real shit will hit the fan in an hour or less,"" said Mr. Nancy, looking more like himself with each moment, ""when they really turn up to collect you. We'll pull over before we get to Highway 53 and get you out of those shackles and back into your own clothes."" Czernobog held up a handcuff key and smiled.
""I like the moustache,"" said Shadow. ""Suits you.""
Czernobog stroked it with a yellowed finger. ""Thank you.""
""Wednesday,"" said Shadow. ""Is he really dead? This isn't some kind of trick is it?""
He realized that he had been holding on to some kind of hope, foolish though it was. But the expression on Nancy's face told him all he needed to know, and the hope was gone.

Coming to America 14,000 B.C. 
Cold it was, and dark, when the vision came to her, for in the far north daylight was a gray dim time in the middle of the day that came, and went, and came again: an interlude between darknesses.
They were not a large tribe as these things were counted then: nomads of the Northern Plains. They had a god, who was the skull of a mammoth, and the hide of a mammoth fashioned into a rough cloak. Nunyunnini they called him. When they were not traveling, he rested on a wooden frame, at man height.
She was the holy woman of the tribe, the keeper of its secrets, and her name was Atsula, the fox. Atsula walked before the two tribesmen who carried their god on long poles, draped with bearskins, that it should not be seen by profane eyes, nor at times when it was not holy.
They roamed the tundra, with their tents. The finest of the tents was made of caribou-hide, and it was the holy tent, and there were four of them inside it: Atsula, the priestess, Gugwei, the tribal elder, Yanu, the war leader, and Kalanu, the scout. She called them there, the day after she had her vision.
Atsula scraped some lichen into the fire, then she threw in dried leaves with her withered left hand: they smoked, with an eye-stinging gray smoke, and gave off an odor that was sharp and strange. Then she took a wooden cup from the wooden platform, and she passed it to Gugwei. The cup was half-filled with a dark yellow liquid.
Atsula had found the pungh mushrooms-each with seven spots, only a true holy woman could find a seven-spotted mushroom-and had picked them at the dark of the moon, and dried them on a string of deer-cartilage.
Yesterday, before she slept, she had eaten the three dried mushroom caps. Her dreams had been confused and fearful things, of bright lights moving fast, of rock mountains filled with lights spearing upward like icicles. In the night she had woken, sweating, and needing to make water. She squatted over the wooden cup and filled it with her urine. Then she placed the cup outside the tent, in the snow, and returned to sleep.
When she woke, she picked the lumps of ice out from the wooden cup, as her mother had taught her, leaving a darker, more concentrated liquid behind.
It was this liquid she passed around the skin tent, first to Gugwei, then to Yanu and to Kalanu. Each of them took a large gulp of the liquid, then Atsula took the final draught. She swallowed it, and poured what was left on the ground in front of their god, a libation to Nunyunnini.
They sat in the smoky tent, waiting for their god to speak. Outside, in the darkness, the wind wailed and breathed.
Kalanu, the scout, was a woman who dressed and walked as a man: she had even taken Dalani, a fourteen-year-old maiden, to be her wife. Kalanu blinked her eyes tightly, then she got up and walked over to the mammoth-skull. She pulled the mammoth-hide cloak over herself, and stood so her head was inside the mammoth-skull.
""There is evil in the land,"" said Nunyunnini. ""Evil, such that if you stay here, in the land of your mothers and your mother's mothers, you shall all perish.""
The three listeners grunted.
""Is it the slavers? Or the great wolves?"" asked Gugwei, whose hair was long and white, and whose face was as wrinkled as the gray skin of a thorn tree.
""It is not the slavers,"" said Nunyunnini, old stone-hide. ""It is not the great wolves.""
""Is it a famine? Is a famine coming?"" asked Gugwei.
Nunyunnini was silent. Kalanu came out of the skull and waited with the rest of them.
Gugwei put on the mammoth-hide cloak and put his head inside the skull. ""It is not a famine as you know it,"" said Nunyunnini, through Gugwei's mouth, ""although a famine will follow.""
""Then what is it?"" asked Yanu. ""I am not afraid. I will stand against it. We have spears, and we have throwing rocks. Let a hundred mighty warriors come against us, still we shall prevail. We shall lead them into the marshes, and split their skulls with our rocks.""
""It is not a man thing,"" said Nunyunnini, in Gugwei's old voice. ""It will come from the skies, and none of your spears or your rocks will protect you.""
""How can we protect ourselves?"" asked Atsula. ""I have seen flames in the skies. I have heard a noise louder than ten thunderbolts. I have seen forests flattened and rivers boil.""
""Ai...,"" said Nunyunnini, but he said no more. Gugwei came out of the skull, bending stiffly, for he was an old man, and his knuckles were swollen and knotted.
There was silence. Atsula threw more leaves on the fire, and the smoke made their eyes tear.
Then Yanu strode to the mammoth-head, put the cloak about his broad shoulders, put his head inside the skull. His voice boomed. ""You must journey,"" said Nunyunnini. ""You must travel to sun-ward. Where the sun rises, there you will find a new land, where you will be safe. It will be a long journey: the moon will swell and empty, die and live, twice, and there will be slavers and beasts, but I shall guide you and keep you safe, if you travel toward the sunrise.""
Atsula spat on the mud of the floor, and said, ""No."" She could feel the god staring at her. ""No,"" she said. ""You are a bad god to tell us this. We will die. We will all die, and then who will be left to carry you from high place to high place, to raise your tent, to oil your great tusks with fat?""
The god said nothing. Atsula and Yanu exchanged places. Atsula's face stared out through the yellowed mammoth-bone.
""Atsula has no faith,"" said Nunyunnini in Atsula's voice. ""Atsula shall die before the rest of you enter the new land, but the rest of you shall live. Trust me: there is a land to the east that is manless. This land shall be your land and the land of your children and your children's children, for seven generations, and seven sevens. But for Atsula's faithlessness, you would have kept it forever. In the morning, pack your tents and your possessions, and walk toward the sunrise.""
And Gugwei and Yanu and Kalanu bowed their heads and exclaimed at the power and wisdom of Nunyunnini.
The moon swelled and waned and swelled and waned once more. The people of the tribe walked east, toward the sunrise, struggling through the icy winds, which numbed their exposed skin. Nunyunnini had promised them truly: they lost no one from the tribe on the journey, save for a woman in childbirth, and women in childbirth belong to the moon, not to Nunyunnini.
They crossed the land-bridge.
Kalanu had left them at first light to scout the way. Now the sky was dark, and Kalanu had not returned, but the night sky was alive with lights, knotting and flickering and winding, flux and pulse, white and green and violet and red. Atsula and her people had seen the northern lights before, but they were still frightened by them, and this was a display like they had never seen before.
Kalanu returned to them, as the lights in the sky formed and flowed.
""Sometimes,"" she said to Atsula, ""I feel that I could simply spread my arms and fall into the sky.""
""That is because you are a scout,"" said Atsula, the priestess. ""When you die, you shall fall into the sky and become a star, to guide us as you guide us in life.""
""There are cliffs of ice to the east, high cliffs,"" said Kalanu, her raven-black hair worn long, as a man would wear it. ""We can climb them, but it will take many days.""
""You shall lead us safely,"" said Atsula. ""I shall die at the foot of the cliff, and that shall be the sacrifice that takes you into the new lands.""
To the west of them, back in the lands from which they had come, where the sun had set hours before, there was a flash of sickly yellow light, brighter than lightning, brighter than daylight: a burst of pure brilliance that forced the folk on the land bridge to cover their eyes and spit and exclaim. Children began to wail.
""That is the doom that Nunyunnini warned us of,"" said Gugwei the old. ""Surely he is a wise god and a mighty one.""
""He is the best of all gods,"" said Kalanu. ""In our new land we shall raise him up on high, and we shall polish his tusks and skull with fish oil and animal fat, and we shall tell our children, and our children's children, and our seventh children's children, that Nunyunnini is the mightiest of all gods, and shall never be forgotten.""
""Gods are great,"" said Atsula, slowly, as if she were comprehending a great secret. ""But the heart is greater. For it is from our hearts they come, and to our hearts they shall return...""
And there is no telling how long she might have continued in this blasphemy, had it not been interrupted in a manner that brooked no argument.
The roar that erupted from the west was so loud that ears bled, that they could hear nothing for some time, temporarily blinded and deafened but alive, knowing that they were luckier than the tribes to the west of them.
""It is good,"" said Atsula, but she could not hear the words inside her head.
Atsula died at the foot of the cliffs when the spring sun was at its zenith. She did not live to see the New World, and the tribe walked into those lands with no holy woman.
They scaled the cliffs, and they went south and west, until they found a valley with fresh water, and rivers that teemed with silver fish, and deer that had never seen man before, and were so tame it was necessary to spit and to apologize to their spirits before killing them.
Dalani gave birth to three boys, and some said that Kalanu had performed the final magic and could do the man-thing with her bride; while others said that old Gugwei was not too old to keep a young bride company when her husband was away; and certainly once Gugwei died, Dalani had no more children.
And the ice times came and the ice times went, and the people spread out across the land, and formed new tribes and chose new totems for themselves: ravens and foxes and ground sloths and great cats and buffalo, each a taboo beast that marked a tribe's identity, each beast a god.
The mammoths of the new lands were bigger, and slower, and more foolish than the mammoths of the Siberian plains, and the pungh mushrooms, with their seven spots, were not to be found in the new lands, and Nunyunnini did not speak to the tribe any longer.
And in the days of the grandchildren of Dalani and Kalanu's grandchildren, a band of warriors, members of a big and prosperous tribe, returning from a slaving expedition in the north to their home in the south, found the valley of the First People: they killed most of the men, and they took the women and many of the children captive.
One of the children, hoping for clemency, took them to a cave in the hills, in which they found a mammoth-skull, the tattered remnants of a mammoth-skin cloak, a wooden cup, and the preserved head of Atsula the oracle.
While some of the warriors of the new tribe were for taking the sacred objects away with them, stealing the gods of the First People and owning their power, others counseled against it, saying that they would bring nothing but ill luck, and the malice of their own god (for these were the people of a raven tribe, and ravens are jealous gods).
So they threw the objects down the side of the hill, into a deep ravine, and took the survivors of the First People with them on their long journey south. And the raven tribes, and the fox tribes, grew more powerful in the land, and soon Nunyunnini was entirely forgot.

The Moment of the Storm 
AG_ch15	AG	American Gods	15	3729	20162	CHAPTER FIFTEEN 

Hang me, O hang me, and I'll be dead and gone,
Hang me, O hang me, and I'll be dead and gone,
I wouldn't mind the hangin', it's bein' gone so long,
It's lyin' in the grave so long.
-OLD SONG 
The first day that Shadow hung from the tree he experienced only discomfort, that edged slowly into pain and fear and, occasionally, an emotion that was somewhere between boredom and apathy: a gray acceptance, a waiting.
He hung.
The wind was still.
After several hours fleeting bursts of color started to explode across his vision in blossoms of crimson and gold, throbbing and pulsing with a life of their own.
The pain in his arms and legs became, by degrees, intolerable. If he relaxed them, let his body go slack and dangle, if he flopped forward, then the rope around his neck would take up the slack and the world would shimmer and swim. So he pushed himself back against the trunk of the tree. He could feel his heart laboring in his chest, a pounding arrhythmic tattoo as it pumped the blood through his body...
Emeralds and sapphires and rubies crystallized and burst in front of his eyes. His breath came in shallow gulps. The bark of the tree was rough against his back. The chill of the afternoon on his naked skin made him shiver, made his flesh prickle and goose.
It's easy, said someone in the back of his head. There's a trick to it. Either you do it, or you die.
It was a wise thing to have thought, he decided. He was pleased with it, and repeated it over and over in the back of his head, part mantra, part nursery rhyme, rattling along to the drumbeat of his heart.

It's easy, there's a trick to it, you do it or you die.
It's easy, there's a trick to it, you do it or you die.
It's easy, there's a trick to it, you do it or you die.
It's easy, there's a trick to it, you do it or you die.
 
Time passed. The chanting continued. He could hear it. Someone was repeating the words, only stopping when Shadow's mouth began to dry out, when his tongue turned dry and skin-like in his mouth. He pushed himself up and away from the tree with his feet, trying to support his weight in a way that would still allow him to fill his lungs.
He breathed until he could hold himself up no more, and then he fell back into the bonds, and hung from the tree.
When the chattering started-an angry, laughing chattering noise-he closed his mouth, concerned that it was he himself making it; but the noise continued. It's the world laughing at me, then, thought Shadow. His head lolled to one side. Something ran down the tree-trunk beside him, stopping beside his head. It chittered loudly in his ear, one word, which sounded a lot like ""ratatosk."" Shadow tried to repeat it, but his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He turned, slowly, and stared into the gray-brown face and pointed ears of a squirrel.
In close-up, he learned, a squirrel looks a lot less cute than it does from a distance. The creature was rat-like, and dangerous, not sweet or charming. And its teeth looked sharp. He hoped that it would not perceive him as a threat, or as a food source. He did not think that squirrels were carnivorous...but then, so many things he had not thought had turned out to be so...
He slept.
The pain woke him several times in the next few hours. It pulled him from a dark dream in which dead children rose and came to him, their eyes peeling, swollen pearls, and they reproached him for failing them and it pulled him from another dream, in which he was staring up at a mammoth, hairy and dark, as it lumbered toward him from the mist, but-awake for a moment, a spider edging across his face, and he shook his head, dislodging or frightening it-now the mammoth was an elephant-headed man, pot-bellied, one tusk broken, and he was riding toward Shadow on the back of a huge mouse. The elephant-headed man curled his trunk towards Shadow and said, ""If you had invoked me before you began this journey, perhaps some of your troubles might have been avoided."" Then the elephant took the mouse, which had, by some means that Shadow could not perceive, become tiny while not changing in size at all, and passed it from hand to hand to hand, fingers curling about it as the little brown creature scampered from palm to palm, and Shadow was not at all surprised when the elephant-headed god finally opened all four of his hands to reveal them perfectly empty. He shrugged arm after arm after arm in a peculiar fluid motion, and looked at Shadow, his face unreadable.
""It's in the trunk,"" Shadow told the elephant man, who had seen the flickering tail vanish.
The elephant man nodded his huge head, and said, ""Yes. In the trunk. You will forget many things. You will give many things away. You will lose many things. But do not lose this."" And then the rains began, and Shadow was awake once more. He tumbled, shivering and wet, from deep sleep to wakefulness in moments. The shivering intensified, until it scared Shadow: he was shivering more violently than he had ever imagined possible, a series of convulsive shudders which built upon each other. He willed himself to stop shaking, but still he shivered, his teeth banging together, his limbs twitching and jerking beyond his control. There was real pain there, too, a deep, knife-like pain that covered his body with tiny, invisible wounds, intimate and unbearable.
  
He opened his mouth to catch the rain as it fell, moistening his cracked lips and his dry tongue, wetting the ropes that bound him to the trunk of the tree. There was a flash of lightning so bright it felt like a blow to his eyes, transforming the world into an intense panorama of image and after-image. Then the thunder, a crack and a boom and a rumble, and, as the thunder echoed, the rain redoubled. In the rain and the night the shivering abated; the knife-blades were put away. Shadow no longer felt the cold, or rather, he felt only the cold, but the cold had now become part of himself, it belonged to him and he belonged to it.
Shadow hung from the tree while the lightning flickered and forked across the sky, and the thunder subsided into an omnipresent rumbling, with occasional bangs and roars like distant bombs exploding in the night, and the wind tugged at Shadow, trying to pull him from the tree, flaying his skin, cutting to the bone; and at the height of the storm-and Shadow knew in his soul that the real storm had truly begun, the true storm, and that now it was here there was nothing any of them could do but ride it out: none of them, old gods or new, spirits, powers, women or men...
A strange joy rose within Shadow then, and he started laughing, as the rain washed his naked skin and the lightning flashed and thunder rumbled so loudly that he could barely hear himself. He laughed and exulted.
He was alive. He had never felt like this. Ever.
If he did die, he thought, if he died right now, here on the tree, it would be worth it to have had this one, perfect, mad moment.
""Hey!"" he shouted, at the storm. ""Hey! It's me! I'm here!""
He trapped some water between his bare shoulder and the trunk of the tree, and he twisted his head over and drank the trapped rainwater, sucking and slurping at it, and he drank more and he laughed, laughed with joy and delight, not madness, until he could laugh no more, until he hung there, too exhausted to move.
At the foot of the tree, on the ground, the rain had made the sheet partly transparent, and had lifted it and pushed it forward so that Shadow could see Wednesday's dead hand, waxy and pale, and the shape of his head, and he thought of the shroud of Turin and he remembered the open girl on Jacquel's slab in Cairo, and then, as if to spite the cold, he observed that he was feeling warm and comfortable, and the bark of the tree felt soft, and he slept once more, and if he dreamed any dreams in the darkness this time he could not remember them.
  
By the following morning the pain was omnipresent. It was no longer local, not confined to the places where the ropes cut into his flesh, or where the bark scraped his skin. Now the pain was everywhere.
And he was hungry, with empty pangs down in the pit of him. His head was pounding. Sometimes he imagined that he had stopped breathing, that his heart had ceased to beat. Then he would hold his breath until he could hear his heart pounding an ocean in his ears and he was forced to suck air like a diver surfacing from the depths.
It seemed to him that the tree reached from hell to heaven, and that he had been hanging there forever. A brown hawk circled the tree, landed on a broken branch near to him, and then took to the wing, flying west.
The storm, which had abated at dawn, began to return as the day passed. Gray, roiling clouds stretched from horizon to horizon; a slow drizzle began to fall. The body at the base of the tree seemed to have become less, in its stained motel winding sheet, crumbling into itself like a sugar cake left in the rain.
Sometimes Shadow burned, sometimes he froze.
When the thunder started once more he imagined that he heard drums beating, kettledrums in the thunder and the thump of his heart, inside his head or outside, it did not matter.
He perceived the pain in colors: the red of a neon bar-sign, the green of a traffic light on a wet night, the blue of an empty video screen.
The squirrel dropped from the bark of the trunk onto Shadow's shoulder, sharp claws digging into his skin. ""Ratatosk!"" it chattered. The tip of its nose touched his lips. ""Ratatosk."" It sprang back onto the tree.
His skin was on fire with pins and needles, a pricking covering his whole body. The sensation was intolerable.
His life was laid out below him, on the motel sheet shroud, literally laid out, like the items at some Dada picnic, a surrealist tableau: he could see his mother's puzzled stare, the American embassy in Norway, Laura's eyes on their wedding day...
He chuckled through dry lips.
""What's so funny, puppy?"" asked Laura.
""Our wedding day,"" he said. ""You bribed the organist to change from playing the 'Wedding March' to the theme-song from Scooby-Doo as you walked toward me down the aisle. Do you remember?""
""Of course I remember, darling. I would have made it too, if it wasn't for those meddling kids.""
""I loved you so much,"" said Shadow.
He could feel her lips on his, and they were warm and wet and living, not cold and dead, so he knew that this was another hallucination. ""You aren't here, are you?"" he asked.
""No,"" she said. ""But you are calling me, for the last time. And I am coming.""
Breathing was harder now. The ropes cutting his flesh were an abstract concept, like free will or eternity.
""Sleep, puppy,"" she said, although he thought it might have been his own voice he heard, and he slept.
  
The sun was a pewter coin in a leaden sky. Shadow was, he realized slowly, awake, and he was cold. But the part of him that understood that seemed very far away from the rest of him. Somewhere in the distance he was aware that his mouth and throat were burning, painful and cracked. Sometimes, in the daylight, he would see stars fall; other times he saw huge birds, the size of delivery trucks, flying toward him. Nothing reached him; nothing touched him.
""Ratatosk. Ratatosk."" The chattering had become a scolding.
The squirrel landed, heavily, with sharp claws, on his shoulder and stared into his face. He wondered if he were hallucinating: the animal was holding a walnut-shell, like a doll's-house cup, in its front paws. The animal pressed the shell to Shadow's lips. Shadow felt the water, and, involuntarily, he sucked it into his mouth, drinking from the tiny cup. He ran the water around his cracked lips, his dry tongue. He wet his mouth with it, and swallowed what was left, which was not much.
The squirrel leapt back to the tree, and ran down it, towards the roots, and then, in seconds, or minutes, or hours, Shadow could not tell which (all the clocks in his mind were broken, he thought, and their gears and cogs and springs were simply a jumble down there in the writhing grass), the squirrel returned with its walnut-shell cup, climbing carefully, and Shadow drank the water it brought to him.
The muddy-iron taste of the water filled his mouth, cooled his parched throat. It eased his fatigue and his madness.
By the third walnut-shell, he was no longer thirsty.
He began to struggle, then, pulling at the ropes, flailing his body, trying to get down, to get free, to get away. He moaned.
The knots were good. The ropes were strong, and they held, and soon he exhausted himself once more.
  
In his delirium, Shadow became the tree. Its roots went deep into the loam of the earth, deep down into time, into the hidden springs. He felt the spring of the woman called Urd, which is to say, Past. She was huge, a giantess, an underground mountain of a woman, and the waters she guarded were the waters of time. Other roots went to other places. Some of them were secret. Now, when he was thirsty, he pulled water from his roots, pulled them up into the body of his being.
He had a hundred arms which broke into a hundred thousand fingers, and all of his fingers reached up into the sky. The weight of the sky was heavy on his shoulders.
It was not that the discomfort was lessened, but the pain belonged to the figure hanging from the tree, rather than to the tree itself, and Shadow in his madness was now so much more than the man on the tree. He was the tree, and he was the wind rattling the bare branches of the world tree; he was the gray sky and the tumbling clouds; he was Ratatosk the squirrel running from the deepest roots to the highest branches; he was the mad-eyed hawk who sat on a broken branch at the top of the tree surveying the world; he was the worm in the heart of the tree.
The stars wheeled, and he passed his hundred hands over the glittering stars, palming them, switching them, vanishing them...
  
A moment of clarity, in the pain and the madness: Shadow felt himself surfacing. He knew it would not be for long. The morning sun was dazzling him. He closed his eyes, wishing he could shade them.
There was not long to go. He knew that, too.
When he opened his eyes, Shadow noticed that there was a young man in the tree with him.
His skin was dark brown. His forehead was high and his dark hair was tightly curled. He was sitting on a branch high above Shadow's head. Shadow could see him clearly by craning his head. And the man was mad. Shadow could see that at a glance.
""You're naked,"" confided the madman, in a cracked voice. ""I'm naked, too.""
""I see that,"" croaked Shadow.
The madman looked at him, then he nodded and twisted his head down and around, as if he were trying to remove a crick from his neck. Eventually he said, ""Do you know me?""
""No,"" said Shadow.
""I know you. I watched you in Cairo. I watched you after. My sister likes you.""
""You are..."" The name escaped him. Eats roadkill. Yes. ""You are Horus.""
The madman nodded. ""Horus,"" he said. ""I am the falcon of the morning, the hawk of the afternoon. I am the sun. As you are the sun. And I know the true name of Ra. My mother told me.""
""That's great,"" said Shadow, politely.
The madman stared at the ground below them intently, saying nothing. Then he dropped from the tree.
A hawk fell like a stone to the ground, pulled out of its plummet into a swoop, beat its wings heavily and flew back to the tree, a baby rabbit in its talons. It landed on a branch closer to Shadow.
""Are you hungry?"" asked the madman.
""No,"" said Shadow. ""I guess I should be, but I'm not.""
""I'm hungry,"" said the madman. He ate the rabbit rapidly, pulling it apart, sucking, tearing, rending. As he finished with them, he dropped the gnawed bones and the fur to the ground. He walked further down the branch until he was only an arm's length from Shadow. Then he peered at Shadow unselfconsciously, inspecting him with care and caution, from his feet to his head. There was rabbit-blood on the man's chin and his chest, and he wiped it off with the back of his hand.
Shadow felt he had to say something. ""Hey,"" he said.
""Hey,"" said the madman. He stood up on the branch, turned away from Shadow and let a stream of dark urine arc out into the meadow below. It went on for a long time. When he had finished he crouched down again on the branch.
""What do they call you?"" asked Horus.
""Shadow,"" said Shadow.
The madman nodded. ""You are the shadow. I am the light,"" he said. ""Everything that is, casts a shadow."" Then he said, ""They will fight soon. I was watching them as they started to arrive. I was high in the sky, and none of them saw me, although some of them have keen eyes.""
And then the madman said, ""You are dying. Aren't you?""
But Shadow could no longer speak. Everything was very far away. A hawk took wing, and circled slowly upward, riding the updrafts into the morning.
  
Moonlight.
A cough shook Shadow's frame, a racking painful cough that stabbed his chest and his throat. He gagged for breath.
""Hey, puppy,"" called a voice that he knew.
He looked down.
The moonlight burned whitely through the branches of the tree, bright as day, and there was a woman standing in the moonlight on the ground below him, her face a pale oval. The wind rattled in the branches of the tree.
""Hi, puppy,"" she said.
He tried to speak, but he coughed instead, deep in his chest, for a long time.
""You know,"" she said, helpfully, ""that doesn't sound good.""
He croaked, ""Hello, Laura.""
She looked up at him with dead eyes, and she smiled.
""How did you find me?"" he asked.
She was silent, for a while, in the moonlight. Then she said, ""You are the nearest thing I have to life. You are the only thing I have left, the only thing that isn't bleak and flat and gray. I could be blindfolded and dropped into the deepest ocean and I would know where to find you. I could be buried a hundred miles underground and I would know where you are.""
He looked down at the woman in the moonlight, and his eyes stung with tears.
""I'll cut you down,"" she said, after a while. ""I spend too much time rescuing you, don't I?""
He coughed again. Then, ""No, leave me. I have to do this.""
She looked up at him, and shook her head. ""You're crazy,"" she said. ""You're dying up there. Or you'll be crippled, if you aren't already.""
""Maybe,"" he said. ""But I'm alive.""
""Yes,"" she said, after a moment. ""I guess you are.""
""You told me,"" he said. ""In the graveyard.""
""It seems like such a long time ago, puppy,"" she said. Then she said, ""I feel better, here. It doesn't hurt as much. You know what I mean? But I'm so dry.""
The wind let up, and he could smell her now: a stink of rotten meat and sickness and decay, pervasive and unpleasant.
""I lost my job,"" she said. ""It was a night job, but they said people had complained. I told them I was sick, and they said they didn't care. I'm so thirsty.""
""The women,"" he told her. ""They have water. The house.""
""Puppy..."" She sounded scared.
""Tell them...tell them I said to give you water...""
The white face stared up at him. ""I should go,"" she told him. Then she hacked, and made a face, and spat a mass of something white onto the grass. It broke up when it hit the ground and wriggled away.
It was almost impossible to breathe. His chest felt heavy, and his head was swaying.
""Stay,"" he said, in a breath that was almost a whisper, unsure whether or not she could hear him. ""Please don't go."" He started to cough. ""Stay the night.""
""I'll stop a while,"" she said. And then, like a mother to a child she said, ""Nothing's gonna hurt you when I'm here. You know that?""
Shadow coughed once more. He closed his eyes-only for a moment, he thought, but when he opened them again the moon had set and he was alone.
  
A crashing and a pounding in his head, beyond the pain of migraine, beyond all pain. Everything dissolved into tiny butterflies which circled him like a multicolored dust storm and then evaporated into the night.
The white sheet wrapped about the body at the base of the tree flapped noisily in the morning wind.
The pounding eased. Everything slowed. There was nothing left to make him keep breathing. His heart ceased to beat in his chest.
The darkness that he entered this time was deep, and lit by a single star, and it was final.

-E.E. CUMMINGS 
Shadow was driving a rental, and he came out of the forest slowly, about 8:30 in the morning, drove down the hill doing under forty-five miles per hour, and entered the town of Lakeside three weeks after he was certain he had left it for good.
He drove through the city, surprised at how little it had changed in the last few weeks, which were a lifetime, and he parked halfway down the driveway that led to the lake. Then he got out of the car.
There were no more ice-fishing huts on the frozen lake any longer, no SUVs, nobody sitting at a fishing hole with a line and a twelve-pack. The lake was dark: no longer covered with a blind white layer of snow, now there were reflective patches of water on the surface of the ice, and the water beneath the ice was dark, and the ice itself was clear enough that the darkness beneath showed through. The sky was gray, but the icy lake was bleak and empty.
Almost empty.
There was one car remaining on the ice, parked out on the frozen lake almost beneath the bridge, so that anyone driving through the town, anyone crossing the town, could not help but see it. It was a dirty green in color; the sort of car that people abandon in parking lots, the kind that they just park and leave because it's just not worth coming back for. It had no engine. It was a symbol of a wager, waiting for the ice to become rotten enough, and soft enough, and dangerous enough to allow the lake to take it forever.
There was a chain across the short driveway that led down to the lake, and a warning sign forbidding entrance to people or to vehicles. THIN ICE, it said. Beneath it was a hand-painted sequence of pictograms with lines through them: no cars, no pedestrians, no snowmobiles. Danger.
Shadow ignored the warnings and scrambled down the bank. It was slippery-the snow had already melted, turning the earth to mud under his feet, and the brown grass barely offered traction. He skidded and slid down to the lake and walked, carefully, out onto a short wooden jetty, and from there he stepped down onto the ice.
The layer of water on the ice, made up of melted ice and melted snow, was deeper than it had looked from above, and the ice beneath the water was slicker and more slippery than any skating rink, so that Shadow was forced to fight to keep his footing. He splashed through the water, as it covered his boots to the laces and seeped inside. Ice water. It numbed where it touched. He felt strangely distant as he trudged across the frozen lake, as if he were watching himself on a movie screen-a movie in which he was the hero, a detective, perhaps: there was a feeling of inevitability, now, as if everything that was going to happen would play itself out, and there was nothing he could have done to change a moment of it.
He walked toward the klunker, painfully aware that the ice was too rotten for this, and that the water beneath the ice was as cold as water could be without freezing. He felt very exposed, out on the ice alone. He kept walking, and he slipped and slid. Several times he fell.
He passed empty beer bottles and cans left to litter the ice, and he passed circular holes cut into the ice, for fishing, holes that had not frozen again, each hole filled with black water.
The klunker seemed further away than it had looked from the road. He heard a loud crack from the south of the lake, like a stick breaking, followed by the sound of something huge thrumming, as if a bass string the size of a lake was vibrating. Massively, the ice creaked and groaned, like an old door protesting being opened. Shadow kept walking, as steadily as he could.
This is suicide, whispered a sane voice in the back of his mind. Can't you just let it go?
""No,"" he said, aloud. ""I have to know."" And he kept right on walking.
He arrived at the klunker, and even before he reached it he knew that he had been right. There was a miasma that hung about the car, something that was at the same time a faint, foul smell and was also a bad taste in the back of his throat. He walked around the car, looking inside. The seats were stained, and ripped. The car was obviously empty. He tried the doors. They were locked. He tried the trunk. Also locked.
He wished that he had brought a crowbar.
He made a fist of his hand inside his glove. He counted to three, then smashed his hand, hard, against the driver's-side window-glass.
His hand hurt. The side-window was undamaged.
He thought about running at it-he could kick the window in, he was certain, if he didn't skid and fall on the wet ice. But the last thing he wanted to do was to disturb the klunker enough that the ice beneath it would crack.
He looked at the car. Then he reached for the radio antenna-it was the kind which was meant to go up and down, but which had stopped going down a decade ago, and had remained in the up position ever since-and, with a little waggling, he broke it off at the base. He took the thin end of the antenna-it had once had a metal button on the end, but that was lost in time, and, with strong fingers, he bent it back up into a makeshift hook.
Then he rammed the extended metal antenna down between the rubber and the glass of the front window, deep into the mechanism of the door. He fished in the mechanism, twisting, moving, pushing the metal antenna about until it caught: and then he pulled up.
He felt the improvised hook sliding from the lock, uselessly.
He sighed. Fished again, slower, more carefully. He could imagine the ice grumbling beneath his feet as he shifted his weight. And slow...and...
He had it. He pulled up on the aerial and the front door locking mechanism popped up. Shadow reached down one gloved hand and took the door handle, pressed the button, and pulled. The door did not open.
It's stuck, he thought, iced up. That's all.
He tugged, sliding on the ice, and suddenly the door of the klunker flew open, ice scattering everywhere.
The miasma was worse inside the car, a stench of rot and illness. Shadow felt sick.
He reached under the dashboard, found the black plastic handle that opened the trunk, and tugged on it, hard.
There was a thunk from behind him as the trunk door released.
Shadow walked out onto the ice, slipped and splashed around the car, holding on to the side of it as he went.
It's in the trunk, he thought.
The trunk was open an inch. He reached down and opened it the rest of the way, pulling it up.
The smell was bad, but it could have been much worse: the bottom of the trunk was filled with an inch or so of half-melted ice. There was a girl in the trunk. She wore a scarlet snowsuit, now stained, and her mousy hair was long and her mouth was closed, so Shadow could not see the blue rubber-band braces, but he knew that they were there. The cold had preserved her, kept her as fresh as if she had been in a freezer.
Her eyes were wide open, and she looked as if she had been crying when she died, and the tears that had frozen on her cheeks had still not melted. Her gloves were bright green.
""You were here all the time,"" said Shadow to Alison McGovern's corpse. ""Every single person who drove over that bridge saw you. Everyone who drove through the town saw you. The ice fishermen walked past you every day. And nobody knew."" And then he realized how foolish that was.
Somebody knew.
Somebody had put her here.
He reached into the trunk-to see if he could pull her out. He had found her, after all. Now he had to get her out. He put his weight on the car, as he leaned in. Perhaps that was what did it.
The ice beneath the front wheels went at that moment, perhaps from his movements, perhaps not. The front of the car lurched downward several feet into the dark water of the lake. Water began to pour into the car through the open driver's door. Water splashed about Shadow's ankles, although the ice he stood on was still solid. He looked around urgently, wondering how to get away-and then it was too late, and the ice tipped precipitously, throwing him against the car and the dead girl in the trunk; and the back of the car went down, and Shadow went down with it, into the cold waters of the lake. It was ten past nine in the morning, on March the twenty-third.
He took a deep breath before he went under, closing his eyes, but the cold of the lake water hit him like a wall, knocking the breath from his body.
He tumbled downward, into the murky ice water, pulled down by the car.
He was under the lake, down in the darkness and the cold, weighed down by his clothes and his gloves and his boots, trapped and swathed in his coat, which seemed to have become heavier and bulkier than he could have imagined.
He was falling, still. He tried to push away from the car, but it was pulling him with it, and then there was a bang which he could hear with his whole body, not his ears, and his left foot was wrenched at the ankle, the foot twisted and trapped beneath the car as it settled on the lake bottom, and panic took him.
He opened his eyes.
He knew it was dark down there: rationally, he knew it was too dark to see anything, but still, he could see; he could see everything. He could see Alison McGovern's white face staring at him from the open trunk. He could see other cars as well-the klunkers of bygone years, rotten hulk shapes in the darkness, half-buried in the lake mud. And what else would they have dragged out onto the lake, thought Shadow, before there were cars?
Each one, he knew, without any question, had a dead child in the trunk. There were scores of them down there. Each had sat out on the ice, in front of the eyes of the world, all through the cold winter. Each had tumbled into the cold waters of the lake, when the winter was done.
This was where they rested: Lemmi Hautala and Jessie Lovat and Sandy Olsen and Jo Ming and Sarah Lindquist and all the rest of them. Down where it was silent and cold...
He pulled at his foot. It was stuck fast, and the pressure in his lungs was becoming unbearable. There was a sharp, terrible, hurt in his ears. He exhaled slowly, and the air bubbled around his face.
Soon, he thought, soon I'll have to breathe. Or I'll choke.
He reached down, put both hands around the bumper of the klunker, and pushed, with everything he had, leaning into it. Nothing happened.
It's only the shell of a car, he told himself. They took out the engine. That's the heaviest part of the car. You can do it. Just keep pushing.
He pushed.
Agonizingly slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, the car slipped forward in the mud, and Shadow pulled his foot from the mud beneath the car, and kicked, and tried to push himself out into the cold lake water. He didn't move. The coat, he told himself. It's the coat. It's stuck, or caught on something. He pulled his arms from his coat, fumbled with numb fingers at the frozen zipper. Then he pulled both hands on each side of the zipper, felt the coat give and rend. Hastily, he freed himself from its embrace, and pushed upward, away from the car.
There was a rushing sensation but no sense of up, no sense of down, and he was choking and the pain in his chest and in his head was too much to bear, so that he was certain that he was going to have to inhale, to breathe in the cold water, to die. And then his head hit something solid.
Ice. He was pushing against the ice on the top of the lake. He hammered at it with his fists, but there was no strength left in his arms, nothing to hold on to, nothing to push against. The world had dissolved into the chill blackness beneath the lake. There was nothing left but cold.
This is ridiculous, he thought. And he thought, remembering some old Tony Curtis film he'd seen as a kid, I should roll onto my back and push the ice upward and press my face to it, and find some air, I could breathe again, there's air there somewhere, but he was just floating and freezing and he could no longer move a muscle, not if his life depended on it, which it did.
The cold became bearable. Became warm. And he thought, I'm dying. There was anger there this time, a deep fury, and he took the pain and the anger and reached with it, flailed, forced muscles to move that were resigned never to move again.
He pushed up with his hand, and felt it scrape the edge of the ice and move up into the air. He flailed for a grip, and felt another hand take his own, and pull.
His head banged against the ice, his face scraped the underneath of the ice, and then his head was up in the air, and he could see that he was coming up through a hole in the ice, and for a moment all he could do was breathe, and let the black lake water run from his nose and his mouth, and blink his eyes, which could see nothing more than a blinding daylight, and shapes, and someone was pulling him, now, forcing him out of the water, saying something about how he'd freeze to death, so come on, man, pull, and Shadow wriggled and shook like a bull seal coming ashore, shaking and coughing and shuddering.
He breathed deep gasps of air, stretched flat out on the creaking ice, and even that would not hold for long, he knew, but it was no good. His thoughts were coming with difficulty, treacle-slow.
""Just leave me,"" he tried to say. ""I'll be fine."" His words were a slur, and everything was drawing to a halt.
He just needed to rest for a moment, that was all, just rest, and then he would get up and move on, for obviously he could not just lie there forever.
There was a jerk; water splashed his face. His head was lifted up. Shadow felt himself being hauled across the ice, sliding on his back across the slick surface, and he wanted to protest, to explain that he just needed a little rest-maybe a little sleep, was that asking for so much?-and he would be just fine. If they just left him alone.
He did not believe that he had fallen asleep, but he was standing on a vast plain, and there was a man there with the head and shoulders of a buffalo, and a woman with the head of an enormous condor, and there was Whiskey Jack standing between them, looking at him sadly, shaking his head.
Whiskey Jack turned and walked slowly away from Shadow. The Buffalo man walked away beside him. The thunderbird woman also walked, and then she ducked and kicked and she was gliding out into the skies.
Shadow felt a sense of loss. He wanted to call to them, to plead with them to come back, not to give up on him, but everything was becoming formless and devoid of shape: they were gone, and the plains were fading, and everything became void.
  
The pain was intense: it was as if every cell in his body, every nerve, was melting and waking and advertising its presence by burning him and hurting him.
There was a hand at the back of his head, gripping it by the hair, and another hand beneath his chin. He opened his eyes, expecting to find himself in some kind of hospital.
His feet were bare. He was wearing jeans. He was naked from the waist up. There was steam in the air. He could see a shaving mirror on the wall facing him, and a small basin, and a blue toothbrush in a toothpaste-stained glass.
Information was processed slowly, one datum at a time.
His fingers burned. His toes burned.
He began to whimper from the pain.
""Easy now, Mike. Easy there,"" said a voice he knew.
""What?"" he said, or tried to say. ""What's happening?"" It sounded strained and strange to his ears.
He was in a bathtub. The water was hot. He thought the water was hot, although he could not be certain. The water was up to his neck.
""Dumbest thing you can do with a fellow freezing to death is to put him in front of a fire. The second-dumbest thing you can do is to wrap him in blankets-especially if he's in cold wet clothes already. Blankets insulate him-keep the cold in. The third-dumbest thing-and this is my private opinion-is to take the fellow's blood out, warm it up, and put it back. That's what doctors do these days. Complicated, expensive. Dumb."" The voice was coming from above and behind his head.
""The smartest, quickest thing you can do is what sailors have done to men overboard for hundreds of years. You put the fellow in hot water. Not too hot. Just hot. Now, just so you know, you were basically dead, when I found you on the ice back there. How are you feeling now, Houdini?""
""It hurts,"" said Shadow. ""Everything hurts. You saved my life.""
""I guess maybe I did, at that. Can you hold your head up on your own now?""
""Maybe.""
""I'm going to let you go. If you start sinking below the water I'll pull you back up again.""
The hands released their grip on his head.
He felt himself sliding forward in the bathtub. He put out his hands, pressed them against the sides of the tub, and leaned back. The bathroom was small. The tub was metal, and the enamel was stained and scratched.
An old man moved into his field of vision. He looked concerned.
""Feeling better?"" asked Hinzelmann. ""You just lay back and relax. I've got the den nice and warm. You tell me when you're ready, I got a robe you can wear, and I can throw your jeans into the dryer with the rest of your clothes. Sound good, Mike?""
""That's not my name.""
""If you say so."" The old man's goblin face twisted into an expression of discomfort.
Shadow had no real sense of time: he lay in the bath until the burning stopped and his toes and fingers flexed without real discomfort. Hinzelmann helped Shadow to his feet and let out the warm water. Shadow sat on the side of the bath and together they pulled off his jeans.
He squeezed, without much difficulty, into a terrycloth robe too small for him, and, leaning on the old man, he went through to the den, and flopped down on an ancient sofa. He was tired and weak: deeply fatigued, but alive. A log fire burned in the fireplace. A handful of surprised-looking deer heads peered down dustily from around the walls, where they jostled for space with several large varnished fish.
Hinzelmann went away with Shadow's jeans, and from the room next door Shadow could hear a brief pause in the rattle of a clothes dryer, before it resumed. The old man returned with a steaming mug.
""It's coffee,"" he said, ""which is a stimulant. And I splashed a little schnapps into it. Just a little. That's what we always did in the old days. A doctor wouldn't recommend it.""
Shadow took the coffee with both hands. On the side of the mug was a picture of a mosquito and the message, GIVE BLOOD-VISIT WISCONSIN!!
""Thanks,"" he said.
""It's what friends are for,"" said Hinzelmann. ""One day, you can save my life. For now, forget about it.""
Shadow sipped the coffee. ""I thought I was dead.""
""You were lucky. I was up on the bridge-I'd pretty much figured that today was going to be the big day, you get a feel for it, when you get to my age-so I was up there with my old pocket watch, and I saw you heading out onto the lake. I shouted, but I sure as heck don't think you coulda heard me. I saw the car go down, and I saw you go down with it, and I thought I'd lost you, so I went out onto the ice. Gave me the heebie-jeebies. You must have been under the water for the best part of two minutes. Then I saw your hand come up through the place where the car went down-it was like seeing a ghost, seeing you there..."" He trailed off. ""We were both damn lucky that the ice took our weight as I dragged you back to the shore.""
Shadow nodded.
""You did a good thing,"" he told Hinzelmann, and the old man beamed all over his goblin face.
Somewhere in the house, Shadow heard a door close. He sipped at his coffee.
Now that he was able to think clearly, he was starting to ask himself questions.
He wondered how an old man, a man half his height and perhaps a third his weight, had been able to drag him, unconscious, across the ice, or get him up the bank to a car. He wondered how Hinzelmann had gotten Shadow into the house and the bath.
Hinzelmann walked over to the fire, picked up the tongs and placed a thin log, carefully, onto the blazing fire.
""Do you want to know what I was doing out on the ice?""
Hinzelmann shrugged. ""None of my business.""
""You know what I don't understand...,"" said Shadow. He hesitated, putting his thoughts in order. ""I don't understand why you saved my life.""
""Well,"" said Hinzelmann, ""the way I was brought up, if you see another fellow in trouble-""
""No,"" said Shadow. ""That's not what I mean. I mean, you killed all those kids. Every winter. I was the only one to have figured it out. You must have seen me open the trunk. Why didn't you just let me drown?""
Hinzelmann tipped his head on one side. He scratched his nose, thoughtfully, rocked back and forth as if he were thinking. ""Well,"" he said. ""That's a good question. I guess it's because I owed a certain party a debt. And I'm good for my debts.""
""Wednesday?""
""That's the fellow.""
""There was a reason he hid me in Lakeside, wasn't there? There was a reason nobody should have been able to find me here.""
Hinzelmann said nothing. He unhooked a heavy black poker from its place on the wall, and he prodded at the fire with it, sending up a cloud of orange sparks and smoke. ""This is my home,"" he said, petulantly. ""It's a good town.""
Shadow finished his coffee. He put the cup down on the floor. The effort was exhausting. ""How long have you been here?""
""Long enough.""
""And you made the lake?""
Hinzelmann peered at him, surprised. ""Yes,"" he said. ""I made the lake. They were calling it a lake when I got here, but it weren't nothing more than a spring and a mill-pond and a creek."" He paused. ""I figured that this country is hell on my kind of folk. It eats us. I didn't want to be eaten. So I made a deal. I gave them a lake, and I gave them prosperity...""
""And all it cost them was one child every winter.""
""Good kids,"" said Hinzelmann, shaking his old head, slowly. ""They were all good kids. I'd only pick ones I liked. Except for Charlie Nelligan. He was a bad seed, that one. He was, what, 1924? 1925? Yeah. That was the deal.""
""The people of the town,"" said Shadow. ""Mabel. Marguerite. Chad Mulligan. Do they know?""
Hinzelmann said nothing. He pulled the poker from the fire: the first six inches at the tip glowed a dull orange. Shadow knew that the handle of the poker must be too hot to hold, but it did not seem to bother Hinzelmann, and he prodded the fire again. He put the poker back into the fire, tip first, and left it there. Then he said, ""They know that they live in a good place. While every other town and city in this county, heck, in this part of the state, is crumbling into nothing. They know that.""
""And that's your doing?""
""This town,"" said Hinzelmann. ""I care for it. Nothing happens here that I don't want to happen. You understand that? Nobody comes here that I don't want to come here. That was why your father sent you here. He didn't want you out there in the world, attracting attention. That's all.""
""And you betrayed him.""
""I did no such thing. He was a crook. But I always pay my debts.""
""I don't believe you,"" said Shadow.
Hinzelmann looked offended. One hand tugged at the clump of white hair at his temple. ""I keep my word.""
""No. You don't. Laura came here. She said something was calling her here. And what about the coincidence that brought Sam Black Crow and Audrey Burton here, on the same night? I don't believe in coincidence any more.
""Sam Black Crow and Audrey Burton. Two people who both knew who I really was, and that there were people out there looking for me. I guess if one of them failed, there was always the other. And if all of them had failed, who else was on their way to Lakeside, Hinzelmann? My old prison warden, up here for a weekend's ice-fishing? Laura's mother?"" Shadow realized that he was angry. ""You wanted me out of your town. You just didn't want to have to tell Wednesday that was what you were doing.""
In the firelight, Hinzelmann seemed more like a gargoyle than an imp. ""This is a good town,"" he said. Without his smile he looked waxen and corpse-like. ""You could have attracted too much attention. Not good for the town.""
""You should have left me back there on the ice,"" said Shadow. ""You should have left me in the lake. I opened the trunk of the klunker. Right now Alison is still iced into the trunk. But the ice will melt, and her body'll float out and up to the surface. And then they'll go down and look and see what else they can find down there. Find your whole stash of kids. I guess some of those bodies are pretty well preserved.""
Hinzelmann reached down and picked up the poker. He made no pretense of stirring the fire with it any longer; he held it like a sword, or a baton, the glowing orange-white tip of it waving in the air. It smoked. Shadow was very aware that he was next-to-naked, and he was still tired, and clumsy, and far from able to defend himself.
""You want to kill me?"" said Shadow. ""Go ahead. Do it. I'm a dead man anyway. I know you own this town-it's your little world. But if you think no one's going to come looking for me, you're living in a dream world. It's over, Hinzelmann. One way or another, it's done.""
Hinzelmann pushed himself to his feet, using the poker as a walking stick. The carpet charred and smoked where he rested the red-hot tip as he got up. He looked at Shadow and there were tears in his pale blue eyes. ""I love this town,"" he said. ""I really like being a cranky old man, and telling my stories and driving Tessie and ice-fishing. Remember what I told you, it's not the fish you bring home from a day's fishing. It's the peace of mind.""
He extended the tip of the poker in Shadow's direction: Shadow could feel the heat of it from a foot away.
""I could kill you,"" said Hinzelmann, ""I could fix it. I've done it before. You're not the first to figure it out. Chad Mulligan's father, he figured it out. I fixed him. I can fix you.""
""Maybe,"" said Shadow. ""But for how long, Hinzelmann? Another year? Another decade? They have computers. They aren't stupid. They pick up on patterns. Every year a kid's going to vanish. They'll come sniffing about here. Just like they'll come looking for me. Tell me-how old are you?"" He curled his fingers around a sofa cushion, and prepared to pull it over his head: it would deflect a first blow.
Hinzelmann's face was expressionless. ""They were giving their children to me before the Romans came to the Black Forest,"" he said. ""I was a god before ever I was a kobold.""
""Maybe it's time to move on,"" said Shadow. He wondered what a kobold was.
Hinzelmann stared at him. Then he took the poker, and pushed the tip of it back into the burning embers. ""Maybe it is, at that,"" he said. ""But it's not that simple. What makes you think I can leave this town, even if I want to, Shadow? I'm part of this town. You going to make me go, Shadow? You ready to kill me? So I can leave?""
Shadow looked down at the floor. There were still glimmers and sparks in the carpet, where the poker-tip had rested. Hinzelmann followed the look with his own, and crushed the embers out with his foot, twisting. In Shadow's mind came, unbidden, children, hundreds of them, staring at him with bone-blind eyes, the hair twisting slowly around their faces like fronds of seaweed. They were looking at him reproachfully.
He knew that he was letting them down. He just didn't know what else to do.
Shadow said, ""I can't kill you. You saved my life.""
He shook his head. He felt like crap, in every way he could feel like crap. He didn't feel like a hero or a detective any more-just another fucking sell-out, waving a stern finger at the darkness before turning his back on it.
""You want to know a secret?"" asked Hinzelmann.
""Sure,"" said Shadow, with a heavy heart. He was ready to be done with secrets.
""Watch this.""
Where Hinzelmann had been standing stood a male child, no more than five years old. His hair was dark brown, and long. He was perfectly naked, save for a worn leather band around his neck. He was pierced with two swords, one of them going through his chest, the other entering at his shoulder, with the point coming out beneath the ribcage. Blood flowed through the wounds without stopping and ran down the child's body to pool and puddle on the floor. The swords looked unimaginably old.
The little boy stared up at Shadow with eyes that held only pain.
And Shadow thought to himself, Of course. That's as good a way as any other of making a tribal god. He did not have to be told. He knew.
You take a baby and you bring it up in the darkness, letting it see no one, touch no one, and you feed it well as the years pass, feed it better than any of the village's other children, and then, five winters on, when the night is at its longest, you drag the terrified child out of its hut and into the circle of bonfires, and you pierce it with blades of iron and of bronze. Then you smoke the small body over charcoal fires until it is properly dried, and you wrap it in furs and carry it with you from encampment to encampment, deep in the Black Forest, sacrificing animals and children to it, making it the luck of the tribe. When, eventually, the thing falls apart from age, you place its fragile bones in a box, and you worship the box; until one day the bones are scattered and forgotten, and the tribes who worshiped the child-god of the box are long gone; and the child-god, the luck of the village, will be barely remembered, save as a ghost or a brownie, a kobold.
Shadow wondered which of the people who had come to northern Wisconsin a hundred and fifty years ago, a woodcutter, perhaps, or a mapmaker, had crossed the Atlantic with Hinzelmann living in his head.
And then the bloody child was gone, and the blood, and there was only an old man with a fluff of white hair and a goblin smile, his sweater-sleeves still soaked from putting Shadow into the bath that had saved his life.
""Hinzelmann?"" The voice came from the doorway of the den.
Hinzelmann turned. Shadow turned too.
""I came over to tell you,"" said Chad Mulligan, and his voice was strained, ""that the klunker went through the ice. I saw it had gone down when I drove over that way, and thought I'd come over and let you know, in case you'd missed it.""
He was holding his gun. It was pointed at the floor.
""Hey, Chad,"" said Shadow.
""Hey, pal,"" said Chad Mulligan. ""They sent me a note said you'd died in custody. Heart attack.""
""How about that?"" said Shadow. ""Seems like I'm dying all over the place.""
""He came down here, Chad,"" said Hinzelmann. ""He threatened me.""
""No,"" said Chad Mulligan. ""He didn't. I've been here for the last ten minutes, Hinzelmann. I heard everything you said. About my old man. About the lake."" He walked further into the den. He did not raise the gun. ""I mean, Jesus, Hinzelmann. You can't drive through this town without seeing that goddamned lake. It's at the center of everything. So what the hell am I supposed to do?""
""You got to arrest him. He said he was going to kill me,"" said Hinzelmann, a scared old man in a dusty den. ""Chad, I'm pleased you're here.""
""No,"" said Chad Mulligan. ""You're not.""
Hinzelmann sighed. He bent down, as if resigned, and he pulled the poker out from the fire. The tip of it was burning bright orange.
""Put that down, Hinzelmann. Just put it down slowly, keep your hands in the air where I can see them, and turn and face the wall.""
There was an expression of pure fear on the old man's face, and Shadow would have felt sorry for him, but he remembered the frozen tears on the cheeks of Alison McGovern, and could not feel anything. Hinzelmann did not move. He did not put down the poker. He did not turn to the wall. Shadow was about to reach for Hinzelmann, to try to take the poker away from him, when the old man threw the burning poker at Chad Mulligan.
Hinzelmann threw it awkwardly, lobbing it across the room as if for form's sake, and as he threw it he was already hurrying for the door.
The poker glanced off Chad's left arm.
The noise of the shot, in the close quarters of the old man's room, was deafening.
One shot to the head, and that was all.
Mulligan said, ""Better get your clothes on."" His voice was dull and dead.
Shadow nodded. He walked to the room next door, opened the door of the clothes dryer and pulled out his clothes. The jeans were still damp. He put them on anyway. By the time he got back to the den, fully dressed-except for his coat, which was somewhere deep in the freezing mud of the lake, and his boots, which he could not find-Mulligan had already hauled several smoldering logs out from the fireplace.
Mulligan said, ""It's a bad day for a cop when he has to commit arson, just to cover up a murder."" Then he looked up at Shadow. ""You need boots,"" he said.
""I don't know where he put them,"" said Shadow.
""Hell,"" said Mulligan. Then he said, ""Sorry about this, Hinzelmann,"" and he picked the old man up by the collar and by the belt buckle, and he swung him forward, dropped the body with its head resting in the open fireplace. The white hair crackled and flared, and the room began to fill with the smell of charring flesh.
""It wasn't murder. It was self-defense,"" said Shadow.
""I know what it was,"" said Mulligan, flatly. He had already turned his attention to the smoking logs he had scattered about the room. He pushed one of them to the edge of the sofa, picked up an old copy of the Lakeside News and pulled it into its component pages, which he crumpled up and dropped onto the log. The newspaper pages browned and then burst into flame.
""Get outside,"" said Chad Mulligan.
He opened the windows as they walked out of the house, and he sprang the lock on the front door to lock it before he closed it.
Shadow followed him out to the police car in his bare feet. Mulligan opened the front passenger door for him, and Shadow got in and wiped his feet off on the mat. Then he put on his socks, which were pretty much dry by now.
""We can get you some boots at Henning's Farm and Home,"" said Chad Mulligan.
""How much did you hear in there?"" asked Shadow.
""Enough,"" said Mulligan. Then he said, ""Too much.""
They drove to Henning's Farm and Home in silence. When they got there the police chief said, ""What size feet?""
Shadow told him.
Mulligan walked into the store. He returned with a pair of thick woolen socks, and a pair of leather farm boots. ""All they had left in your size,"" he said. ""Unless you wanted gumboots. I figured you didn't.""
Shadow pulled on the socks and the boots. They fitted fine. ""Thanks,"" he said.
""You got a car?"" asked Mulligan.
""It's parked by the road down to the lake. Near the bridge.""
Mulligan started the car and pulled out of the Henning's parking lot.
""What happened to Audrey?"" asked Shadow.
""Day after they took you away, she said she liked me as a friend, but it would never work out between us, us being family and all, and she went back to Eagle Point. Broke my gosh-darn heart.""
""Makes sense,"" said Shadow. ""And it wasn't personal. Hinzelmann didn't need her here any more.""
They drove back past Hinzelmann's house. A thick plume of white smoke was coming up from the chimney.
""She only came to town because he wanted her here. She was something to help him to get me out of town. I was bringing attention he didn't need.""
""I thought she liked me.""
They pulled up beside Shadow's rental car. ""What are you going to do now?"" asked Shadow.
""I don't know,"" said Mulligan. His normally harassed face was starting to look more alive than it had at any point since Hinzelmann's den. It also looked more troubled. ""I figure, I got a couple of choices. Either I'll..."" And he made a gun of his first two fingers, and put the fingertips into his open mouth, and removed them. ""...put a bullet through my brain. Or I'll wait another couple of days until the ice is mostly gone, and tie a concrete block to my leg and jump off the bridge. Or pills. Sheesh. Maybe I should just drive a while, out to one of the forests. Take pills out there. I don't want to make one of my guys have to do the clean-up. Leave it for the county, huh?"" He sighed, and shook his head.
""You didn't kill Hinzelmann, Chad. He died a long time ago, a long way from here.""
""Thanks for saying that, Mike. But I killed him. I shot a man in cold blood, and I covered it up. And if you asked me why I did it, why I really did it, I'm darned if I could tell you.""
Shadow put out a hand, touched Mulligan on the arm. ""Hinzelmann owned this town,"" he said. ""I don't think you had a lot of choice about what happened back there. I think he brought you there. He wanted you to hear what you heard. He set you up. I guess it was the only way he could leave.""
Mulligan's miserable expression did not change. Shadow could see that the police chief had barely heard anything that he had said. He had killed Hinzelmann and built him a pyre, and now, obeying the last of Hinzelmann's desires, or simply because it was the only thing he could do to live with himself, he would commit suicide.
Shadow closed his eyes, remembering the place in his head that he had gone when Wednesday had told him to make snow: that place that pushed, mind to mind, and he smiled a smile he did not feel and he said, ""Chad. Let it go."" There was a cloud in the man's mind, a dark, oppressive cloud, and Shadow could almost see it and, concentrating on it, imagined it fading away like a fog in the morning. ""Chad,"" he said, fiercely, trying to penetrate the cloud, ""this town is going to change now. It's not going to be the only good town in a depressed region any more. It's going to be a lot more like the rest of this part of the world. There's going to be a lot more trouble. People out of work. People out of their heads. More people getting hurt. More bad shit going down. They are going to need a police chief with experience. The town needs you."" And then he said, ""Marguerite needs you.""
Something shifted in the storm cloud that filled the man's head. Shadow could feel it change. He pushed then, envisioning Marguerite Olsen's practical brown hands and her dark eyes, and her long, long black hair. He pictured the way she tipped her head on one side and half-smiled when she was amused. ""She's waiting for you,"" said Shadow, and he knew it was true as he said it.
""Margie?"" said Chad Mulligan.
And at that moment, although he could never tell you how he had done it, and he doubted that he could ever do it again, Shadow reached in to Chad Mulligan's mind, easy as anything, and he plucked the events of that afternoon from it as precisely and dispassionately as a raven picking an eye from roadkill.
The creases in Chad's forehead smoothed, and he blinked, sleepily.
""Go see Margie,"" said Shadow. ""It's been good seeing you, Chad. Take care of yourself.""
""Sure,"" yawned Chad Mulligan.
A message crackled over the police radio, and Chad reached out for the handset. Shadow got out of the car.
Shadow walked over to his rental car. He could see the gray flatness of the lake at the center of the town. He thought of the dead children who waited at the bottom of the water.
Soon, Alison would float to the surface...
As Shadow drove past Hinzelmann's place he could see the plume of smoke had already turned into a blaze. He could hear a siren wail.
He drove south, heading for Highway 51. He was on his way to keep his final appointment. But before that, he thought, he would stop off in Madison, for one last goodbye.
  
Best of everything, Samantha Black Crow liked closing up the Coffee House at night. It was a perfectly calming thing to do: it gave her a feeling that she was putting order back into the world. She would put on an Indigo Girls CD, and she would do her final chores of the night at her own pace and in her own way. First, she would clean the espresso machine. Then she would do the final rounds, ensuring that any missed cups or plates were deposited back in the kitchen, and that the newspapers that were always scattered around the Coffee House by the end of each day were collected together and piled neatly by the front door, all ready for recycling.
She loved the Coffee House. She'd gone there as a customer for six months before she talked Jeff, the manager, into giving her a job. It was a long, winding series of rooms filled with armchairs and sofas and low tables, on a street lined with second-hand bookstores.
She covered the leftover slices of cheesecake and put them into the large refrigerator for the night, then she took a cloth and wiped the last of the crumbs away. She enjoyed being alone.
As she worked she would sing along with the Indigo Girls. Sometimes she would break into a dance for a step or two, before catching herself, and stopping, smiling wryly at herself.
A tapping on the window jerked her attention from her chores back to the real world. She went to the door, opened it, to admit a woman of about Sam's age, with pigtailed magenta hair. Her name was Natalie.
""Hello,"" said Natalie. She went up on tiptoes and kissed Sam, depositing the kiss snugly between Sam's cheek and the corner of her mouth. You can say a lot of things with a kiss like that. ""You done?""
""Nearly.""
""You want to see a movie?""
""Sure. Love to. I've got a good five minutes left here, though. Why don't you sit and read the Onion?""
""I saw this week's already."" She sat on a chair near the door, ruffled through the pile of newspapers put aside for recycling until she found something, and she read it, while Sam bagged up the last of the money in the till and put it in the safe.
They had been sleeping together for a week now. Sam wondered if this was it, the relationship she'd been waiting for all her life. She told herself that it was just brain chemicals and pheromones that made her happy when she saw Natalie, and perhaps that was what it was; still, all she knew for sure was that she smiled when she saw Natalie, and that when they were together she felt comfortable and comforted.
""This paper,"" said Natalie, ""has another one of those articles in it. 'Is America Changing?'""
""Well, is it?""
""They don't say. They say that maybe it is, but they don't know how and they don't know why, and maybe it isn't happening at all.""
Sam smiled broadly. ""Well,"" she said, ""that covers every option, doesn't it?""
""I guess."" Natalie's brow creased and she went back to her newspaper.
Sam washed the dishcloth and folded it. ""I think it's just that, despite the government and whatever, everything just feels suddenly good right now. Maybe it's just spring coming a little early. It was a long winter, and I'm glad it's over.""
""Me, too."" A pause. ""It says in the article that lots of people have been reporting weird dreams. I haven't really had any weird dreams. Nothing weirder than normal.""
Sam looked around to see if there was anything she had missed. Nope. It was a good job well done. She took off her apron, hung it back in the kitchen. Then she came back and started to turn off the lights. ""I've had some weird dreams recently,"" she said. ""They got weird enough that I actually started keeping a dream journal. They seem to mean so much while I'm dreaming them. I write them down when I wake up. And then when I read them, they don't mean anything at all.""
She put on her street coat, and her one-size-fits-all gloves.
""I did some dream work,"" said Natalie. Natalie had done a little of everything, from arcane self-defense disciplines and sweat lodges to feng shui and jazz dancing. ""Tell me. I'll tell you what they mean.""
""Okay."" Sam unlocked the door and turned the last of the lights off. She let Natalie out, and she walked out onto the street and locked the door to the Coffee House firmly behind her. ""Sometimes I have been dreaming of people who fell from the sky. Sometimes I'm underground, talking to a woman with a buffalo head. And sometimes I dream about this guy I kissed once in a bar.""
Natalie made a noise. ""Something you should have told me about?""
""Maybe. But not like that. It was a Fuck-Off Kiss.""
""You were telling him to fuck off?""
""No, I was telling everyone else they could fuck off. You had to be there, I guess.""
Natalie's shoes clicked down the sidewalk. Sam padded on next to her. ""He owns my car,"" said Sam.
""That purple thing you got at your sister's?""
""Yup.""
""What happened to him? Why doesn't he want his car?""
""I don't know. Maybe he's in prison. Maybe he's dead.""
""Dead?""
""I guess."" Sam hesitated. ""A few weeks back, I was certain he was dead. ESP. Or whatever. Like, I knew. But then, I started to think maybe he wasn't. I don't know. I guess my ESP isn't that hot.""
""How long are you going to keep his car?""
""Until someone comes for it. I think it's what he would have wanted.""
Natalie looked at Sam, then she looked again. Then she said, ""Where did you get those from?""
""What?""
""The flowers. The ones you're holding, Sam. Where did they come from? Did you have them when we left the Coffee House? I would have seen them.""
Sam looked down. Then she grinned. ""You are so sweet. I should have said something when you gave them to me, shouldn't I?"" she said. ""They are lovely. Thank you so much. But wouldn't red have been more appropriate?""
They were roses, their stems wrapped in paper. Six of them, and white.
""I didn't give them to you,"" said Natalie, her lips firming.
And neither of them said another word until they reached the movie theater.
When she got home that night Sam put the roses in an improvised vase. Later, she cast them in bronze, and she kept to herself the tale of how she got them, although she told Caroline, who came after Natalie, the story of the ghost-roses one night when they were both very drunk, and Caroline agreed with Sam that it was a really, really strange and a spooky story, and, deep down, did not actually believe a word of it, so that was all right.
  
Shadow had parked near the capitol building, and walked slowly around the square, stretching his legs after the long drive. His clothes were uncomfortable, although they had dried on his body, and the new boots were still tight. He passed a payphone. He called information, and they gave him the number.
No, he was told. She isn't here. She's not back yet. She's probably still at the Coffee House.
He stopped on the way to the Coffee House to buy flowers.
He found the Coffee House, then he crossed the road and stood in the doorway of a used bookstore, and waited, and watched.
The place closed at eight, and at ten past eight Shadow saw Sam Black Crow walk out of the Coffee House in the company of a smaller woman whose pigtailed hair was a peculiar shade of red. They were holding hands tightly, as if simply holding hands could keep the world at bay, and they were talking-or rather, Sam was doing most of the talking while her friend listened. Shadow wondered what Sam was saying. She smiled as she talked.
The two women crossed the road, and they walked past the place where Shadow was standing. The pigtailed girl passed within a foot of him; he could have reached out and touched her, and they didn't see him at all.
He watched them walking away from him down the street, and felt a pang, like a minor chord being played inside him.
It had been a good kiss, Shadow reflected, but Sam had never looked at him the way she was looking at the pigtailed girl, and she never would.
""What the hell. We'll always have Peru,"" he said, under his breath, as Sam walked away from him. ""And El Paso. We'll always have that.""
Then he ran after her, and put the flowers into Sam's hands. He hurried away, so she could not give them back.
Then he walked up the hill back to his car, and he took Highway 90 south to Chicago. He drove at or slightly under the speed limit.
It was the last thing he had to do.
He was in no hurry.
  
He spent the night in a Motel 6. He got up the next morning, and realized his clothes still smelled like the bottom of the lake. He put them on anyway. He figured he wouldn't need them much longer.
Shadow paid his bill. He drove to the brownstone apartment building. He found it without any difficulty. It was smaller than he remembered.
He walked up the stairs steadily, not fast, that would have meant he was eager to go to his death, and not slow, that would have meant he was afraid. Someone had cleaned the stairwell: the black garbage bags had gone. The place smelled of the chlorine-smell of bleach, no longer of rotting vegetables.
The red-painted door at the top of the stairs was wide open: the smell of old meals hung in the air. Shadow hesitated, then he pressed the doorbell.
""I come!"" called a woman's voice, and, dwarf-small and dazzlingly blonde, Zorya Utrennyaya came out of the kitchen and bustled towards him, wiping her hands on her apron. She looked different, Shadow realized. She looked happy. Her cheeks were rouged red, and there was a sparkle in her old eyes. When she saw him her mouth became an O and she called out, ""Shadow? You came back to us?"" and she hurried toward him with her arms outstretched. He bent down and embraced her, and she kissed his cheek. ""So good to see you!"" she said. ""Now you must go away.""
Shadow stepped into the apartment. All the doors in the apartment (except, unsurprisingly, Zorya Polunochnaya's) were wide open, and all the windows he could see were open as well. A gentle breeze blew fitfully through the corridor.
""You're spring cleaning,"" he said to Zorya Utrennyaya.
""We have a guest coming,"" she told him. ""Now, you must go away. First, you want coffee?""
""I came to see Czernobog,"" said Shadow. ""It's time.""
Zorya Utrennyaya shook her head violently. ""No, no,"" she said. ""You don't want to see him. Not a good idea.""
""I know,"" said Shadow. ""But you know, the only thing I've really learned about dealing with gods is that if you make a deal, you keep it. They get to break all the rules they want. We don't. Even if I tried to walk out of here, my feet would just bring me back.""
She pushed up her bottom lip, then said, ""Is true. But go today. Come back tomorrow. He will be gone then.""
""Who is it?"" called a woman's voice, from further down the corridor. ""Zorya Utrennyaya, to who are you talking? This mattress, I cannot turn on my own, you know.""
Shadow walked down the corridor, and said, ""Good morning, Zorya Vechernyaya. Can I help?"" which made the woman in the room squeak with surprise and drop her corner of the mattress.
The bedroom was thick with dust: it covered every surface, the wood and the glass, and motes of it floated and danced through the beams of sunshine coming through the open window, disturbed by occasional breezes and the lazy flapping of the yellowed lace curtains.
He remembered this room. This was the room they had given to Wednesday, that night. Bielebog's room.
Zorya Vechernyaya eyed him uncertainly. ""The mattress,"" she said. ""It needs to be turned.""
""Not a problem,"" said Shadow. He reached out and took the mattress, lifted it with ease and turned it over. It was an old wooden bed, and the feather mattress weighed almost as much as a man. Dust flew and swirled as the mattress went down.
""Why are you here?"" asked Zorya Vechernyaya. It was not a friendly question, the way she asked it.
""I'm here,"" said Shadow, ""because back in December a young man played a game of checkers with an old god, and he lost.""
The old woman's gray hair was up on the top of her head in a tight bun. She pursed her lips. ""Come back tomorrow,"" said Zorya Vechernyaya.
""I can't,"" he said, simply.
""Is your funeral. Now, you go and sit down. Zorya Utrennyaya will bring you coffee. Czernobog will be back soon.""
Shadow walked along the corridor to the sitting room. It was just as he remembered, although now the window was open. The gray cat slept on the arm of the sofa. It opened an eye as Shadow came in and then, unimpressed, it went back to sleep.
This was where he had played checkers with Czernobog; this was where he had wagered his life to get the old man to join them on Wednesday's last doomed grift. The fresh air came in through the open window, blowing the stale air away.
Zorya Utrennyaya came in with a red wooden tray. A small enameled cup of steaming black coffee sat on the tray, beside a saucer filled with small chocolate-chip cookies. She put it down on the table in front of him.
""I saw Zorya Polunochnaya again,"" he said. ""She came to me under the world, and she gave me the moon to light my way. And she took something from me. But I don't remember what.""
""She likes you,"" said Zorya Utrennyaya. ""She dreams so much. And she guards us all. She is so brave.""
""Where's Czernobog?""
""He says the spring-cleaning makes him uncomfortable. He goes out to buy newspaper, sit in the park. Buy cigarettes. Perhaps he will not come back today. You do not have to wait. Why don't you go? Come back tomorrow.""
""I'll wait,"" said Shadow. This was no geas, forcing him to wait, he knew that. This was him. It was one last thing that needed to happen, and if it was the last thing that happened, well, he was going there of his own volition. After this there would be no more obligations, no more mysteries, no more ghosts.
He sipped the hot coffee, as black and as sweet as he remembered.
He heard a deep male voice in the corridor, and he sat up straighter. He was pleased to see that his hand was not trembling. The door opened.
""Shadow?""
""Hi,"" said Shadow. He stayed sitting down.
Czernobog walked into the room. He was carrying a folded copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, which he put down on the coffee table. He stared at Shadow, then he put his hand out, tentatively. The two men shook hands.
""I came,"" said Shadow. ""Our deal. You came through with your part of it. This is my part.""
Czernobog nodded. His brow creased. The sunlight glinted on his gray hair and moustache, making them appear almost golden. ""Is..."" He frowned. ""Is not..."" He broke off. ""Maybe you should go. Is not a good time.""
""Take as long as you need,"" said Shadow. ""I'm ready.""
Czernobog sighed. ""You are a very stupid boy. You know that?""
""I guess.""
""You are a stupid boy. And on the mountaintop, you did a very good thing.""
""I did what I had to do.""
""Perhaps.""
Czernobog walked to the old wooden sideboard, and, bending down, pulled an attaché case from underneath it. He flipped the catches on the case. Each one sprang back with a satisfying thump. He opened the case. He took a hammer out, and hefted it, experimentally. The hammer looked like a scaled-down sledgehammer; its wooden haft was stained.
Then he stood up. He said, ""I owe you much. More than you know. Because of you, things are changing. This is spring time. The true spring.""
""I know what I did,"" said Shadow. ""I didn't have a lot of choice.""
Czernobog nodded. There was a look in his eyes that Shadow did not remember seeing before. ""Did I ever tell you about my brother?""
""Bielebog?"" Shadow walked to the center of the ash-stained carpet. He went down on his knees. ""You said you hadn't seen him in a long time.""
""Yes,"" said the old man, raising the hammer. ""It has been a long winter, boy. A very long winter. But the winter is ending, now."" And he shook his head, slowly, as if he were remembering something. And he said, ""Close your eyes.""
Shadow closed his eyes and raised his head, and he waited.
The head of the sledgehammer was cold, icy cold, and it touched his forehead as gently as a kiss.
""Pock! There,"" said Czernobog. ""Is done."" There was a smile on his face that Shadow had never seen before, an easy, comfortable smile, like sunshine on a summer's day. The old man walked over to the case, and he put the hammer away, and closed the bag, and pushed it back under the sideboard.
""Czernobog?"" asked Shadow. Then, ""Are you Czernobog?""
""Yes. For today,"" said the old man. ""By tomorrow, it will all be Bielebog. But today, is still Czernobog.""
""Then why? Why didn't you kill me when you could?""
The old man took out an unfiltered cigarette from a pack in his pocket. He took a large box of matches from the mantelpiece and lit the cigarette with a match. He seemed deep in thought. ""Because,"" said the old man, after some time, ""there is blood. But there is also gratitude. And it has been a long, long winter.""
Shadow got to his feet. There were dusty patches on the knees of his jeans, where he had knelt, and he brushed the dust away.
""Thanks,"" he said.
""You're welcome,"" said the old man. ""Next time you want to play checkers, you know where to find me. This time, I play white.""
""Thanks. Maybe I will,"" said Shadow. ""But not for a while."" He looked into the old man's twinkling eyes, and he wondered if they had always been that cornflower shade of blue. They shook hands, and neither of them said goodbye.
Shadow kissed Zorya Utrennyaya on the cheek on his way out, and he kissed Zorya Vechernyaya on the back of her hand, and he took the stairs out of that place two at a time.

Postscript 

Reykjavík in Iceland is a strange city, even for those who have seen many strange cities. It is a volcanic city-the heat for the city comes from deep underground.
There are tourists, but not as many of them as you might expect, not even in early July. The sun was shining, as it had shone for weeks now: it ceased shining for an hour or so in the small hours. There would be a dusky dawn of sorts between two and three in the morning, and then the day would begin once more.
The big tourist had walked most of Reykjavík that morning, listening to people talk in a language that had changed little in a thousand years. The natives here could read the ancient sagas as easily as they could read a newspaper. There was a sense of continuity on this island that scared him, and that he found desperately reassuring. He was very tired: the unending daylight had made sleep almost impossible, and he had sat in his hotel room through the whole long nightless night alternately reading a guidebook and Bleak House, a novel he had bought in an airport in the last few weeks, but which airport he could no longer remember. Sometimes, he had stared out of the window.
Finally the clock as well as the sun proclaimed it morning.
He bought a bar of chocolate at one of the many candy stores, walked the sidewalk, occasionally finding himself reminded of the volcanic nature of Iceland: he would turn a corner and notice, for a moment, a sulphurous quality to the air. It put him in mind not of Hades but of rotten eggs.
Many of the women he passed were very beautiful: slender and pale. The kind of women that Wednesday had liked. Shadow wondered what could have attracted Wednesday to Shadow's mother, who had been beautiful but had been neither of those things.
Shadow smiled at the pretty women, because they made him feel pleasantly male, and he smiled at the other women too, because he was having a good time.
He was not sure when he became aware that he was being observed. Somewhere on his walk through Reykjavík he became certain that someone was watching him. He would turn, from time to time, trying to get a glimpse of who it was, and he would stare into store windows and out at the reflected street behind him, but he saw no one out of the ordinary, no one who seemed to be observing him.
He went into a small restaurant, where he ate smoked puffin and cloudberries and arctic char and boiled potatoes, and he drank Coca-Cola, which tasted sweeter, more sugary than he remembered it tasting back in the States.
The waiter brought his bill-the meal was more expensive than Shadow had expected, but that seemed to be true of meals in every place on Shadow's wandering. As the waiter put the bill down on the table, he said, ""Excuse me. You are American?""
""Yes.""
""Then, happy Fourth of July,"" said the waiter. He looked pleased with himself.
Shadow had not realized that it was the Fourth. Independence Day. Yes. He liked the idea of independence. He left the money and a tip on the table, and walked outside. There was a cool breeze coming in off the Atlantic, and he buttoned up his coat.
He sat down on a grassy bank and looked at the city that surrounded him, and thought, one day he would have to go home. And one day he would have to make a home to go back to. He wondered whether home was a thing that happened to a place after a while, or if it was something that you found in the end, if you simply walked and waited and willed it long enough.
He pulled out his book.
An old man came striding across the hillside toward him: he wore a dark gray cloak, ragged at the bottom, as if he had done a lot of traveling, and he wore a broad-brimmed blue hat, with a seagull feather tucked into the band, at a jaunty angle. He looked like an aging hippie, thought Shadow. Or a long-retired gunfighter. The old man was ridiculously tall.
The man squatted beside Shadow on the hillside. He nodded, curtly, to Shadow. He had a piratical black eye patch over one eye, and a jutting white chin-beard. Shadow wondered if the man was going to hit him up for a cigarette.
""Hvernig gengur? Manst Þú eftir mér?"" said the old man.
""I'm sorry,"" said Shadow. ""I don't speak Icelandic."" Then he said, awkwardly, the phrase he had learned from his phrase book in the daylight of the small hours of that morning: ""Ég tala bara ensku."" I speak only English. ""American.""
The old man nodded slowly. He said, ""My people went from here to America a long time ago. They went there, and then they returned to Iceland. They said it was a good place for men, but a bad place for gods. And without their gods they felt too...alone."" His English was fluent, but the pauses and the beats of the sentence were strange. Shadow looked at him: close-up, the man seemed older than Shadow had imagined possible. His skin was lined with tiny wrinkles and cracks, like the cracks in granite.
The old man said, ""I do know you, boy.""
""You do?""
""You and I, we have walked the same path. I also hung on the tree for nine days, a sacrifice of myself to myself. I am the lord of the Aes. I am the god of the gallows.""
""You are Odin,"" said Shadow.
The man nodded thoughtfully, as if weighing up the name. ""They call me many things, but, yes, I am Odin, Bor's son,"" he said.
""I saw you die,"" said Shadow. ""I stood vigil for your body. You tried to destroy so much, for power. You would have sacrificed so much for yourself. You did that.""
""I did not do that.""
""Wednesday did. He was you.""
""He was me, yes. But I am not him."" The man scratched the side of his nose. His gull-feather bobbed.
""Will you go back?"" asked the Lord of the Gallows. ""To America?""
""Nothing to go back for,"" said Shadow, and as he said it he knew it was a lie.
""Things wait for you there,"" said the old man. ""But they will wait until you return.""
A white butterfly flew crookedly past them. Shadow said nothing. He had had enough of gods and their ways to last him several lifetimes. He would take the bus to the airport, he decided, and change his ticket. Get a plane to somewhere he had never been. He would keep moving.
""Hey,"" said Shadow. ""I have something for you."" His hand dipped into his pocket, and palmed the object he needed. ""Hold your hand out,"" he said.
Odin looked at him strangely and seriously. Then he shrugged, and extended his right hand, palm down. Shadow reached over and turned it so the palm was upward.
He opened his own hands, showed them, one after the other, to be completely empty. Then he pushed the glass eye into the leathery palm of the old man's hand and left it there.
""How did you do that?""
""Magic,"" said Shadow, without smiling.
The old man grinned and laughed and clapped his hands together. He looked at the eye, holding it between finger and thumb, and nodded, as if he knew exactly what it was, and then he slipped it into a leather bag that hung by his waist. ""Takk kærlega. I shall take care of this.""
""You're welcome,"" said Shadow. He stood up, brushed the grass from his jeans. He closed the book, put it back into the side-pocket of his backpack.
""Again,"" said the Lord of Asgard, with an imperious motion of his head, his voice deep and commanding. ""More. Do again.""
""You people,"" said Shadow. ""You're never satisfied. Okay. This is one I learned from a guy who's dead now.""
He reached into nowhere, and took a gold coin from the air. It was a normal sort of gold coin. It couldn't bring back the dead or heal the sick, but it was a gold coin sure enough. ""And that's all there is,"" he said, displaying it between finger and thumb. ""That's all she wrote.""
He tossed the coin into the air with a flick of his thumb. It spun golden at the top of its arc, in the sunlight, and it glittered and glinted and hung there in the mid-summer sky as if it was never going to come down. Maybe it never would. Shadow didn't wait to see. He walked away and he kept on walking.

Acknowledgments 

It's been a long book, and a long journey, and I owe many people a great deal.
Mrs. Hawley lent me her Florida house to write in, and all I had to do in return was scare away the vultures. She lent me her Irish house to finish it in and cautioned me not to scare away the ghosts. My thanks to her and Mr. Hawley for all their kindness and generosity. Jonathan and Jane lent me their house and hammock to write in, and all I had to do was fish the occasional peculiar Floridian beastie out of the lizard pool. I'm very grateful to them all.
Dan Johnson, MD, gave me medical information whenever I needed it, pointed out stray and unintentional anglicisms (everybody else did this as well), answered the oddest questions, and, on one July day, even flew me around northern Wisconsin in a tiny plane. In addition to keeping my life going by proxy while I wrote this book, my assistant, the fabulous Lorraine Garland, became very blasé about finding out the population of small American towns for me; I'm still not sure quite how she did it. (She's part of a band called the Flash Girls: buy their new record, Play Each Morning, Wild Queen, and make her happy.) Terry Pratchett helped unlock a knotty plot point for me on the train to Gothenburg. Eric Edelman answered my diplomatic questions. Anna Sunshine Ison unearthed a bunch of stuff for me on the West Coast Japanese internment camps, which will have to wait for another book to be written for it never quite fitted into this one. I stole the best line of dialogue in the epilogue from Gene Wolfe, to whom, my thanks. Sergeant Kathy Ertz graciously answered even my weirdest police procedural questions and Deputy Sheriff Marshall Multhauf took me on a drive-along. Pete Clark submitted to some ridiculously personal questioning with grace and good humor. Dale Robertson was the book's consulting hydrologist. I appreciated Dr. Jim Miller's comments about people, language and fish, as I did the linguistic help of Margret Rodas. Jamy Ian Swiss made sure that the coin magic was magical. Any mistakes in the book are mine, not theirs.
Many good people read the manuscript and offered valuable suggestions, corrections, encouragement, and information. I am especially grateful to Colin Greenland and Susanna Clarke, John Clute and Samuel R. Delany. I'd also like to thank Owl Goingback (who really does have the world's coolest name), Iselin Røsjø Evensen, Peter Straub, Jonathan Carroll, Kelli Bickman, Dianna Graf, Lenny Henry, Pete Atkins, Chris Ewen, Teller, Kelly Link, Barb Gilly, Will Shetterly, Connie Zastoupil, Rantz Hoseley, Diana Schutz, Steve Brust, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Roz Kaveney, Ian McDowell, Karen Berger, Wendy Japhet, Terje Nordberg, Gwenda Bond, Therese Littleton, Lou Aronica, Hy Bender, Mark Askwith, Alan Moore (who also graciously lent me ""Litvinoff's Book""), and the original Joe Sanders. Thanks also to Rebecca Wilson; and particular thanks to Stacy Weiss, for her insight. After she read the first draft, Diana Wynne Jones warned me what kind of book this was, and the perils I risked writing it, and she's been right on every count so far.
I wish Professor Frank McConnell were still with us. I think he would have enjoyed this one.
Once I'd written the first draft I realized that a number of other people had tackled these themes before ever I got to them: in particular my favorite unfashionable author, James Branch Cabell, the late Roger Zelazny, and, of course, the inimitable Harlan Ellison, whose collection Deathbird Stories burned itself onto the back of my head when I was still of an age where a book could change me forever.
I can never quite see the point of noting down for posterity the music you listened to while writing a book, and there was an awful lot of music listened to while I was writing this. Still, without Greg Brown's Dream Café and the Magnetic Fields' 69 Love Songs it would have been a different book, so thanks to Greg and to Stephin. And I feel it my duty to tell you that you can experience the music of the House on the Rock on tape or CD, including that of the Mikado machine and of the World's Largest Carousel. It's unlike, although certainly not better than, anything else you've heard. Write to: The House on the Rock, Spring Green, WI 53588 USA, or call 1-608-935-3639.
My agents-Merrilee Heifetz at Writers House, Jon Levin and Erin Culley La Chapelle at CAA-were invaluable as sounding boards and pillars of wisdom.
Many people, who were waiting for things I had promised them just as soon as I finished writing this book, were astonishingly patient. I'd like to thank the good folk at Warner Bros. pictures (particularly Kevin McCormick and Lorenzo di Bonaventura), at Village Roadshow, at Sunbow, and at Miramax; and Shelly Bond, who put up with a lot.
The two people without whom: Jennifer Hershey at Harper Collins in the U.S. and Doug Young at Hodder Headline in the UK. I'm lucky to have good editors, and these are two of the best editors I've known. Not to mention two of the most uncomplaining, patient, and, as the deadlines whirled past us like dry leaves in a gust of wind, positively stoic.
Bill Massey came in at the end, at Headline, and lent the book his editorial eagle eye. Kelly Notaras helped shepherd it through production with grace and polish.
Lastly, I want to thank my family, Mary, Mike, Holly, and Maddy, who were the most patient of all, who loved me, and who, for long periods during the writing of this book, put up with my going away both to write and to find America-which turned out, when I eventually found it, to have been in America all along.

APPENDIX 

I'd been looking forward to writing the meeting of Shadow and Jesus for most of the book: I couldn't write about America without mentioning Jesus, after all. He's part of the warp and the weft of the country.
And then I wrote their first scene together in chapter fifteen, and it didn't work for me; I felt like I was alluding to something that I couldn't simply mention in passing and then move on from. It was too big.
So I took it out again.
I nearly put it back in, assembling this author's preferred text. Actually, I did put it back in. And then I took it out again, and put it here. You can read it. I'm just not sure that it's necessarily part of American Gods.
Consider it an apocryphal scene, perhaps.
One day, Shadow will come back to America.
There are some extremely interesting conversations awaiting him...
  
People were walking around beside him, in his mind or out of it. Some of the people he seemed to recognize, others were strangers.
""And what's a stranger but a friend you haven't met yet?"" said someone to him, passing him a drink.
He took the drink, walked with the person down a light brown corridor. They were in a Spanish-style building, and they moved from adobe corridor to open courtyard to corridor once more, while the sun beat down on the water gardens and the fountains.
""It might be an enemy you've not met yet too,"" said Shadow.
""Bleak, Shadow, very bleak,"" said the man. Shadow sipped his drink. It was a brackish red wine.
""It's been a bleak few months,"" said Shadow. ""It's been a bleak few years.""
The man was slender, tanned, of medium height, and he looked up at Shadow with a gentle, empathetic smile. ""How's the vigil going, Shadow?""
""The tree?"" Shadow had forgotten that he was hanging from the silver tree. He wondered what else he had forgotten. ""It hurts.""
""Suffering is sometimes cleansing,"" said the man. His clothes were casual, but expensive. ""It can purify.""
""It can also fuck you up,"" said Shadow.
The man led Shadow into a vast office. There was no desk in there, though. ""Have you thought about what it means to be a god?"" asked the man. He had a beard and a baseball cap. ""It means you give up your mortal existence to become a meme: something that lives forever in people's minds, like the tune of a nursery rhyme. It means that everyone gets to re-create you in their own minds. You barely have your own identity any more. Instead, you're a thousand aspects of what people need you to be. And everyone wants something different from you. Nothing is fixed, nothing is stable.""
Shadow sat in a comfortable leather chair, by the window. The man sat on the enormous sofa. ""Great place you've got here,"" said Shadow.
""Thanks. Be honest now, how's the wine?""
Shadow hesitated. ""Kind of sour, I'm afraid.""
""Sorry. That's the trouble with wine. Okay wine I can do easily, but good wine, let alone great wine...well, you've got weather, soil acidity, rainfall, even which side of a hill the grapes are grown on. Don't get me started on vintages...""
""It's fine, really,"" said Shadow, and he swallowed the rest of the wine in one long gulp. He could feel it burning in his empty stomach, feel the bubbles of drunkenness rising at the back of his head.
""And then this whole deal of new gods, old gods,"" said his friend. ""You ask me, I welcome new gods. Bring them on. The god of the guns. The god of bombs. All the gods of ignorance and intolerance, of self-righteousness, idiocy and blame. All the stuff they try and land me with. Take a lot of the weight off my shoulders."" He sighed.
""But you're so successful,"" said Shadow. ""Look at this place."" He gestured, indicating the paintings on the walls, the hardwood floor, the fountain in the courtyard below them.
His friend nodded. ""It has a cost,"" he said. ""Like I said. You have to be all things to all people. Pretty soon, you're spread so thin you're hardly there at all. It's not good.""
He reached out one callused hand-the fingers were etched with old chisel scars-and squeezed Shadow's hand. ""I know, I know. I should count my blessings. And one of those blessings is getting time just to meet you like this, and to talk. It's great that you were able to make it,"" he said. ""Really great. Don't be a stranger now.""
""No. I'll just be a friend you've not met yet,"" said Shadow.
""Funny guy,"" said the man with the beard.
""Ratatosk, ratatosk,"" chattered the squirrel in Shadow's ear. He could taste the bitter wine still, in his mouth and the back of his throat, and it was almost dark.

An Interview with Neil Gaiman 

Which godlike powers would you like to posses? 
I want to make time stretchier. I would like much more rubbery days, and I just wish that you could lean on a week, and sort of push the walls out a bit, and suddenly about nineteen extra days would rush in to fill the vacuum.
There is not enough time, and I wind up just wanting to do things that I don't have time for. There are so many things that I'd love to do, and I have to put off, or that it's a matter of me choosing, when really I'd love to do both. And if only time were infinitely stretchy, I could.
What is your favorite roadside attraction? 
The House on the Rock in American Gods actually is real. Most people think I made it up, whereas in actual fact I just toned it down a bit so that people would believe it. Because being a real place it has no obligation to be likely. So I left out the 120-piece robot orchestra and other stuff.
I remember, the first time I went to The House on the Rock, thinking, I just don't believe this place, and the second time I went to The House on the Rock still not believing this place. Then I had to go back for Entertainment Weekly to take my photograph standing beside the largest carousel in the world.
It was the single loudest photo session I've ever had because they actually pitch the volume of the mechanical instruments in that room in order to keep people moving through. You're not really meant to linger too long by the largest carousel in the world.
The photo session went on for several hours and the photographer was communicating with me entirely by hand gestures. He would tap his chin and point up so that I'd know to look up a bit.
How did you find out about it? 
Like most roadside attractions in America, they have signposts for it that start about 300 miles away, and imply it's just around the corner. I'd seen all these signs saying THE HOUSE ON THE ROCK, and thought it was very near where I lived, and eventually discovered it was 250 miles away.
On the other hand, Rock City, which is also in American Gods, is worse, because I saw my first signpost to SEE ROCK CITY, THE WORLD'S WONDER driving through mountainous Tennessee or Kentucky or somewhere, and again assumed it was just around the corner, and then drove for the greater part of a day.
And then of course, because it's almost impossible to get to once you're there, I drove straight past it. Then I drove back and checked it out, and decided it was going to be in my book.
What was your strangest plane journey? 
The trouble with plane journeys is you start folding them all together. I do remember one which was not necessarily my strangest plane journey, but had something I've never seen happen before or since.
I'd just been served with a large cup of apple juice and the plane hit one of those air pockets and dropped several hundred feet. It didn't bother any of us because we were all seat belted in, but my apple juice shot straight out of my cup. The cup remained in the same place, but the contents made a slow and incredibly graceful arc across the cabin and landed in a businessman's lap half an airplane away.
I was with Dave McKean at the time on a Mr. Punch signing tour and we tried to pretend it wasn't us. At least they knew we hadn't actually thrown it; it was the apple juice that made a mad leap for freedom.
What's your favorite coin trick? 
The favorite coin trick I've ever done was when I started work on American Gods and I had a large notebook, a fountain pen, and a copy of Bobo's Modern Coin Magic.
I went from one to the other and I spent days practicing my French Drop and my Downs Palm and all of those things because I knew Shadow was going to be into coin magic and I felt that I had to be able to write about it reasonably convincingly. I'd never done any magic before but I decided I had to now.
I was actually on a train across America, going to San Diego, and there was a ten-year-old girl traveling with her mother. We'd all been on this train now for about three days so we all knew each other, and I disappeared a coin for her rather unexpectedly and reappeared it from her ear. I don't think anybody had ever done anything like that for her and seeing the expression on her face left me understanding why people become magicians.
I of course have never become a magician, but I get to hang around with the Penn and Tellers and the Derren Browns of this world, who are all very, very good people and who will humor me and treat me like one of their own although they know that really I'm not.
Favorite con artist or con trick? 
Ponzi, who created the Ponzi scheme. The thing that people laugh at in terms of confidence tricks is somebody selling you the Brooklyn Bridge, or in England somebody selling you London Bridge, or in France somebody selling you the Eiffel Tower.
Ponzi sold the Eiffel Tower by going to all the major scrap metal agents in France, presenting himself as a representative of the French government, and explaining that the Eiffel Tower had become unsafe and they were going to be scrapping it, but they needed somebody who could handle the dismantling of the tower and the volume of metal that this would generate. He also implied that the French government was going to be so grateful that there would probably be all sorts of decorations involved for anybody who took this on.
And then he explained to each of them in turn that it was a sealed envelope bid, so there was no possibility for corruption. So they went off to prepare their bids, and he privately got in touch with each of these gentleman and explained that he could be bribed. And each of them gave him vast sums of money in order to buy the Eiffel Tower. And that, I feel, is still my favorite con.
Did you enjoy making up the con tricks in American Gods? 
I did enjoy making up the con tricks very much, although I have to say I found myself rather baffled. The one that I thought you could actually do I tried to sort of fuzz the edges of a bit, so the reader can't actually figure out exactly how things work with Mr. Wednesday and the credit cards. What he did is doable but I fuzzed the edges so the reader can't do it.
But I was very proud of myself for coming up with the ATM card night deposit con. I made that up, and I thought it was really funny until the phone rang about eighteen months ago and it was a reporter from Canada letting me know that somebody who was a fan of the book had just done it and was now on the run, having taken local merchants for $30,000.
You don't expect your readers to go, ""Ah this book's not just a fine work of literary whatshisname, but also a get-rich-quick scheme,"" to be followed shortly by a go-to-prison-quick scheme, which I believe he did.
Are there any myths you would like to dispel? 
I have my journal over at www.neilgaiman.com, and one of the reasons for having it, apart from the fact that it's incredibly useful to have an immediate plug-in to your readers, is that I used to turn up at signings and people would expect me to be characters that I'd created. Particularly the Sandman.
So I'd turn up to the signing and see the disappointment on people's faces because I wasn't tall and pale and beautiful and very morbid. They expected me to speak in gnomic gothic sentences and possibly iambic pentameter, or triolets or something.
I like the blog because it undercuts and dispels that. I don't think you can imagine somebody as a beautiful gothic figure if they've just written about clearing up cat vomit from the floor at three o'clock in the morning.
It's now a few years since American Gods came out. Do you have any thoughts on the novel? 
People were incredibly nice about American Gods. I never expected all the awards that it won, particularly when it won the Hugo, and the Nebula, and the Bram Stoker award-that was delightful. And Americans were terribly nice about it. Nobody actually did the whole ""How dare you, being English, write about America?,"" which I thought was kind of them.
The thing I found really amusing was about some places in the middle where people are talking in the way they talk in Wisconsin and Minnesota: occasionally I would have New Yorkers and Los Angelinos accusing me of lapsing into Briticisms there, mostly I think because people have no idea what people talk like in the rest of their country.

Reading Group Discussion Questions 

 
American Gods is an epic novel dealing with many big themes, including sacrifice, loyalty, betrayal, love, and faith. Which theme affected you the most strongly, and why? 
Shadow begins the novel as a convict, and ends it a different man. How does the novel exploit the idea of America as a place where immigrants and exiles, both physical and emotional, can reinvent themselves? What makes Shadow himself so compelling and complex? 
American Gods is partly a road trip through small-town America, where Shadow can see the darker side of life that other people ignore. What does the novel say about what people will accept in order to maintain a sense of normality? 
The old gods expect sacrifice, violence, and worship. How have they adapted to the modern world? What does this say about the nature of divinity? How and why have Americans transferred their devotion to the new technological and material gods from the old spiritual gods? What comment is being made about modern cultural values? 
What is the significance of the illusions, cons, and magic tricks that occur throughout the novel? American Gods is a novel in which magic, myth, and the divine coexist with the normal, mundane, and human in a way that is utterly believable. How is this illusion maintained? 
How does the rich background description increase the power of the narrative? What do the secondary characters, particularly the gods whose lives and deaths we are given a brief insight into, add to the novel? 
 

How Dare You? 

Nobody's asked the question I've been dreading, so far, the question I have been hoping that no one would ask. So I'm going to ask it myself, and try to answer it myself, in the hopes that, like the airline passenger scared of being hijacked who always smuggles her own bomb onto the plane, my doing it increases the odds against someone else doing it.
And the question is this: How dare you?
Or, in its expanded form: ""How dare you, an Englishman, try and write a book about America, about American myths and the American soul? How dare you try and write about what makes America special, as a country, as a nation, as an idea?""
And, being English, my immediate impulse is to shrug my shoulders and promise it won't happen again.
But then, I did dare, in my novel American Gods, and it took an odd sort of hubris to write it.
As a young man, I wrote a comic book about dreams and stories called Sandman (collected, and still in print, in ten graphic novels, and you should read it if you haven't). I got a similar question all the time, back then: ""You live in England. How can you set so much of this story in America?""
And I would point out that, in media terms, the U.K. was practically the fifty-first state. We get American films, watch American TV. ""I might not write a Seattle that would satisfy an inhabitant,"" I used to say, ""but I'll write one as good as a New Yorker who's never been to Seattle.""
I was, of course, wrong. I didn't do that at all. What I did instead was, in retrospect, much more interesting: I created an America that was entirely imaginary, in which Sandman could take place. A delirious, unlikely place out beyond the edge of the real.
And that satisfied me until, following my American wife and my desire for an Addams Family-style house, I came to live in America.
Slowly-and it took a while-I realized both that the America I'd been writing was wholly fictional, and that the real America, the one underneath the what-you-see-is-what-you-get surface, was much more interesting than the fictions.
The immigrant experience is, I suspect, a universal one (even if you are the kind if immigrant, like me, who holds on tightly, almost superstitiously, to his U.K. citizenship, long after his accent has become rather dodgy). On the one hand, there's you, and on the other hand, there's America. It's bigger than you are. So you try and make sense of it. You try to figure it out-something which it resists. It's big enough, and contains enough contradictions, that it is perfectly happy not to be figured out, and somewhere in there you realize that the very best you can hope for is to be like one of the blind men in the fable who each grasped an elephant by its trunk, its leg, its side, its tail, and who each decided that an elephant was like a snake, a tree, a wall, a rope. As a writer all I could do was to describe a small part of the whole.
And it was too big to see.
I didn't really know what kind of book I wanted to write until, in the summer of 1998, I found myself spending forty-eight hours in Reykjavík, in Iceland, and in the middle of that stay I knew what my next book was. A bunch of fragments of plot, an unwieldy assortment of characters, and something faintly resembling a structure came together in my head. Maybe it was because I was far enough away from America to see it clearly, maybe it was just that its time had come. It would be a thriller, and a murder mystery, and a romance, and a road trip. It would be about the immigrant experience, about what people believed in when they came to America. And about what happened to the things that they believed. I'm English. I like being English. I've kept my passport. I've as much of my accent as I could. And I'd lived in the U.S. for almost nine years. Long enough to know that everything I'd learned about it from the movies was wrong.
I wanted to write about myths. I wanted to write about America as a mythic place.
I went back to my hotel room and wrote a three-page-long rough outline-more of a loose description of the book I had in my head. I tried calling it Magic America (after the Blur song), and that didn't seem right. I tried calling it King of America (after the Elvis Costello album) and that didn't seem right either. So I wrote American Gods (not after anything) at the top of the first page of the outline, and figured I'd come up with a better title sooner or later.
I'd not started writing the novel by the time the publisher sent me the cover. It showed a road and a lightning bolt and, in large letters, a title: American Gods. There seemed no point in fighting it-to be honest, I was starting to like it-and I started to write.
It's a big book, but then America's a big country, and trying to fit it into a book was hard enough.
American Gods is the story of a man called Shadow, and the job he is offered when he gets out of prison. It is the story of a road trip. It tells the story of a small Midwestern town, and the disappearances that occur there every winter. I discovered, as I wrote it, why roadside attractions are the most sacred places in America. I learned a lot about gods, and about secret organizations, and wars. I discovered many other strange byways and moments. Some of them delighted me. A few scared me. Some of them amazed me.
When it was almost done, when all that remained was to pull together all the diverse strands, I left the country again, holed up in a huge, cold, old house in Ireland, and typed all that was left to type, shivering, beside a peat fire.
And then the book was done, and I stopped. Looking back on it, it wasn't really that I'd dared, rather that I had no choice.

CL_ch1	CL	Coraline	1	1823	10487	I.CORALINE DISCOVERED THE DOOR a little while after they moved into the house.It was a very old house-it had an attic under the roof and a cellar under the ground and an overgrown garden with huge old trees in it.Coraline's family didn't own all of the house-it was too big for that. Instead they owned part of it.There were other people who lived in the old house.Miss Spink and Miss Forcible lived in the flat below Coraline's, on the ground floor. They were both old and round, and they lived in their flat with a number of ageing Highland terriers who had names like Hamish and Andrew and Jock. Once upon a time Miss Spink and Miss Forcible had been actresses, as Miss Spink told Coraline the first time she met her.""You see, Caroline,"" Miss Spink said, getting Coraline's name wrong, ""both myself and Miss Forcible were famous actresses, in our time. We trod the boards, luvvy. Oh, don't let Hamish eat the fruitcake, or he'll be up all night with his tummy.""""It's Coraline. Not Caroline. Coraline,"" said Coraline.In the flat above Coraline's, under the roof, was a crazy old man with a big mustache. He told Coraline that he was training a mouse circus. He wouldn't let anyone see it.""One day, little Caroline, when they are all ready, everyone in the whole world will see the wonders of my mouse circus. You ask me why you cannot see it now. Is that what you asked me?""""No,"" said Coraline quietly, ""I asked you not to call me Caroline. It's Coraline.""""The reason you cannot see the mouse circus,"" said the man upstairs, ""is that the mice are not yet ready and rehearsed. Also, they refuse to play the songs I have written for them. All the songs I have written for the mice to play go oompah oompah. But the white mice will only play toodle oodle, like that. I am thinking of trying them on different types of cheese.""Coraline didn't think there really was a mouse circus. She thought the old man was probably making it up.The day after they moved in, Coraline went exploring.She explored the garden. It was a big garden: at the very back was an old tennis court, but no one in the house played tennis and the fence around the court had holes in it and the net had mostly rotted away; there was an old rose garden, filled with stunted, flyblown rosebushes; there was a rockery that was all rocks; there was a fairy ring, made of squidgy brown toadstools which smelled dreadful if you accidentally trod on them.There was also a well. On the first day Coraline's family moved in, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible made a point of telling Coraline how dangerous the well was, and they warned her to be sure she kept away from it. So Coraline set off to explore for it, so that she knew where it was, to keep away from it properly.She found it on the third day, in an overgrown meadow beside the tennis court, behind a clump of trees-a low brick circle almost hidden in the high grass. The well had been covered up by wooden boards, to stop anyone falling in. There was a small knothole in one of the boards, and Coraline spent an afternoon dropping pebbles and acorns through the hole and waiting, and counting, until she heard the plop as they hit the water far below.Coraline also explored for animals. She found a hedgehog, and a snakeskin (but no snake), and a rock that looked just like a frog, and a toad that looked just like a rock.There was also a haughty black cat, who sat on walls and tree stumps and watched her but slipped away if ever she went over to try to play with it.That was how she spent her first two weeks in the house-exploring the garden and the grounds.Her mother made her come back inside for dinner and for lunch. And Coraline had to make sure she dressed up warm before she went out, for it was a very cold summer that year; but go out she did, exploring, every day until the day it rained, when Coraline had to stay inside.""What should I do?"" asked Coraline.""Read a book,"" said her mother. ""Watch a video. Play with your toys. Go and pester Miss Spink or Miss Forcible, or the crazy old man upstairs.""""No,"" said Coraline. ""I don't want to do those things. I want to explore.""""I don't really mind what you do,"" said Coraline's mother, ""as long as you don't make a mess.""Coraline went over to the window and watched the rain come down. It wasn't the kind of rain you could go out in-it was the other kind, the kind that threw itself down from the sky and splashed where it landed. It was rain that meant business, and currently its business was turning the garden into a muddy, wet soup.Coraline had watched all the videos. She was bored with her toys, and she'd read all her books.She turned on the television. She went from channel to channel to channel, but there was nothing on but men in suits talking about the stock market, and talk shows. Eventually, she found something to watch: it was the last half of a natural history program about something called protective coloration. She watched animals, birds, and insects which disguised themselves as leaves or twigs or other animals to escape from things that could hurt them. She enjoyed it, but it ended too soon and was followed by a program about a cake factory.It was time to talk to her father.Coraline's father was home. Both of her parents worked, doing things on computers, which meant that they were home a lot of the time. Each of them had their own study.""Hello Coraline,"" he said when she came in, without turning round.""Mmph,"" said Coraline. ""It's raining.""""Yup,"" said her father. ""It's bucketing down.""""No,"" said Coraline. ""It's just raining. Can I go outside?""""What does your mother say?""""She says you're not going out in weather like that, Coraline Jones.""""Then, no.""""But I want to carry on exploring.""""Then explore the flat,"" suggested her father. ""Look-here's a piece of paper and a pen. Count all the doors and windows. List everything blue. Mount an expedition to discover the hot water tank. And leave me alone to work.""""Can I go into the drawing room?"" The drawing room was where the Joneses kept the expensive (and uncomfortable) furniture Coraline's grandmother had left them when she died. Coraline wasn't allowed in there. Nobody went in there. It was only for best.""If you don't make a mess. And you don't touch anything.""Coraline considered this carefully, then she took the paper and pen and went off to explore the inside of the flat.She discovered the hot water tank (it was in a cupboard in the kitchen).She counted everything blue (153).She counted the windows (21).She counted the doors (14).Of the doors that she found, thirteen opened and closed. The other-the big, carved, brown wooden door at the far corner of the drawing room-was locked.She said to her mother, ""Where does that door go?""""Nowhere, dear.""""It has to go somewhere.""Her mother shook her head. ""Look,"" she told Coraline.She reached up and took a string of keys from the top of the kitchen doorframe. She sorted through them carefully, and selected the oldest, biggest, blackest, rustiest key. They went into the drawing room. She unlocked the door with the key.The door swung open.Her mother was right. The door didn't go anywhere. It opened onto a brick wall.""When this place was just one house,"" said Coraline's mother, ""that door went somewhere. When they turned the house into flats, they simply bricked it up. The other side is the empty flat on the other side of the house, the one that's still for sale.""She shut the door and put the string of keys back on top of the kitchen doorframe.""You didn't lock it,"" said Coraline.Her mother shrugged. ""Why should I lock it?"" she asked. ""It doesn't go anywhere.""Coraline didn't say anything.It was nearly dark outside now, and the rain was still coming down, pattering against the windows and blurring the lights of the cars in the street outside.Coraline's father stopped working and made them all dinner.Coraline was disgusted. ""Daddy,"" she said, ""you've made a recipe again.""""It's leek and potato stew with a tarragon garnish and melted Gruyère cheese,"" he admitted.Coraline sighed. Then she went to the freezer and got out some microwave chips and a microwave minipizza.""You know I don't like recipes,"" she told her father, while her dinner went around and around and the little red numbers on the microwave oven counted down to zero.""If you tried it, maybe you'd like it,"" said Coraline's father, but she shook her head.That night, Coraline lay awake in her bed. The rain had stopped, and she was almost asleep when something went t-t-t-t-t-t. She sat up in bed.Something went kreeee...      ...aaaakCoraline got out of bed and looked down the hall, but saw nothing strange. She walked down the hall. From her parents' bedroom came a low snoring-that was her father-and an occasional sleeping mutter-that was her mother.Coraline wondered if she'd dreamed it, whatever it was.Something moved.It was little more than a shadow, and it scuttled down the darkened hall fast, like a little patch of night.She hoped it wasn't a spider. Spiders made Coraline intensely uncomfortable.The black shape went into the drawing room, and Coraline followed it a little nervously.The room was dark. The only light came from the hall, and Coraline, who was standing in the doorway, cast a huge and distorted shadow onto the drawing room carpet-she looked like a thin giant woman.Coraline was just wondering whether or not she ought to turn on the lights when she saw the black shape edge slowly out from beneath the sofa. It paused, and then dashed silently across the carpet toward the farthest corner of the room.There was no furniture in that corner of the room.Coraline turned on the light.There was nothing in the corner. Nothing but the old door that opened onto the brick wall.She was sure that her mother had shut the door, but now it was ever so slightly open. Just a crack. Coraline went over to it and looked in. There was nothing there-just a wall, built of red bricks.Coraline closed the old wooden door, turned out the light, and went to bed.She dreamed of black shapes that slid from place to place, avoiding the light, until they were all gathered together under the moon. Little black shapes with little red eyes and sharp yellow teeth.They started to sing,We are small but we are manyWe are many we are smallWe were here before you roseWe will be here when you fall.Their voices were high and whispering and slightly whiney. They made Coraline feel uncomfortable.Then Coraline dreamed a few commercials, and after that she dreamed of nothing at all.
CL_ch2	CL	Coraline	2	1392	8162	II.THE NEXT DAY IT HAD stopped raining, but a thick white fog had lowered over the house.""I'm going for a walk,"" said Coraline.""Don't go too far,"" said her mother. ""And dress up warmly.""Coraline put on her blue coat with a hood, her red scarf, and her yellow Wellington boots.She went out.Miss Spink was walking her dogs. ""Hello, Caroline,"" said Miss Spink. ""Rotten weather.""""Yes,"" said Coraline.""I played Portia once,"" said Miss Spink. ""Miss Forcible talks about her Ophelia, but it was my Portia they came to see. When we trod the boards.""Miss Spink was bundled up in pullovers and cardigans, so she seemed more small and circular than ever. She looked like a large, fluffy egg. She wore thick glasses that made her eyes seem huge.""They used to send flowers to my dressing room. They did,"" she said.""Who did?"" asked Coraline.Miss Spink looked around cautiously, looking over first one shoulder and then over the other, peering into the mists as though someone might be listening.""Men,"" she whispered. Then she tugged the dogs to heel and waddled off back toward the house.Coraline continued her walk.She was three quarters of the way around the house when she saw Miss Forcible, standing at the door to the flat she shared with Miss Spink.""Have you seen Miss Spink, Caroline?""Coraline told her that she had, and that Miss Spink was out walking the dogs.""I do hope she doesn't get lost-it'll bring on her shingles if she does, you'll see,"" said Miss Forcible. ""You'd have to be an explorer to find your way around in this fog.""""I'm an explorer,"" said Coraline.""Of course you are, luvvy,"" said Miss Forcible. ""Don't get lost, now.""Coraline continued walking through the gardens in the gray mist. She always kept in sight of the house. After about ten minutes of walking she found herself back where she had started.The hair over her eyes was limp and wet, and her face felt damp.""Ahoy! Caroline!"" called the crazy old man upstairs.""Oh, hullo,"" said Coraline.She could hardly see the old man through the mist.He walked down the steps on the outside of the house that led up past Coraline's front door to the door of his flat. He walked down very slowly. Coraline waited at the bottom of the stairs.""The mice do not like the mist,"" he told her. ""It makes their whiskers droop.""""I don't like the mist much, either,"" admitted Coraline.The old man leaned down, so close that the bottoms of his mustache tickled Coraline's ear. ""The mice have a message for you,"" he whispered.Coraline didn't know what to say.""The message is this. Don't go through the door."" He paused. ""Does that mean anything to you?""""No,"" said Coraline.The old man shrugged. ""They are funny, the mice. They get things wrong. They got your name wrong, you know. They kept saying Coraline. Not Caroline. Not Caroline at all.""He picked up a milk bottle from the bottom of the stairs and started back up to his attic flat.Coraline went indoors. Her mother was working in her study. Her mother's study smelled of flowers.""What shall I do?"" asked Coraline.""When do you go back to school?"" asked her mother.""Next week,"" said Coraline.""Hmph,"" said her mother. ""I suppose I shall have to get you new school clothes. Remind me, dear, or else I'll forget,"" and she went back to typing things on the computer screen.""What shall I do?"" repeated Coraline.""Draw something,"" Her mother passed her a sheet of paper and a ballpoint pen.Coraline tried drawing the mist. After ten minutes of drawing she still had a white sheet of paper withwritten on it in one corner in slightly wiggly letters. She grunted and passed it to her mother.""Mm. Very modern, dear,"" said Coraline's mother.Coraline crept into the drawing room and tried to open the old door in the corner. It was locked once more. She supposed her mother must have locked it again. She shrugged.Coraline went to see her father.He had his back to the door as he typed. ""Go away,"" he said cheerfully as she walked in.""I'm bored,"" she said.""Learn how to tap-dance,"" he suggested, without turning around.Coraline shook her head. ""Why don't you play with me?"" she asked.""Busy,"" he said. ""Working,"" he added. He still hadn't turned around to look at her. ""Why don't you go and bother Miss Spink and Miss Forcible?""Coraline put on her coat and pulled up her hood and went out of the house. She went downstairs. She rang the door of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's flat. Coraline could hear a frenzied woofing as the Scottie dogs ran out into the hall. After a while Miss Spink opened the door.""Oh, it's you, Caroline,"" she said. ""Angus, Hamish, Bruce, down now, luvvies. It's only Caroline. Come in, dear. Would you like a cup of tea?""The flat smelled of furniture polish and dogs.""Yes, please,"" said Coraline. Miss Spink led her into a dusty little room, which she called the parlor. On the walls were black-and-white photographs of pretty women, and theater programs in frames. Miss Forcible was sitting in one of the armchairs, knitting hard.They poured Coraline a cup of tea in a little pink bone china cup, with a saucer. They gave her a dry Garibaldi biscuit to go with it.Miss Forcible looked at Miss Spink, picked up her knitting, and took a deep breath. ""Anyway, April. As I was saying: you still have to admit, there's life in the old dog yet.""""Miriam, dear, neither of us is as young as we were.""""Madame Arcati,"" replied Miss Forcible. ""The nurse in Romeo. Lady Bracknell. Character parts. They can't retire you from the stage.""""Now, Miriam, we agreed,"" said Miss Spink. Coraline wondered if they'd forgotten she was there. They weren't making much sense; she decided they were having an argument as old and comfortable as an armchair, the kind of argument that no one ever really wins or loses but which can go on forever, if both parties are willing.She sipped her tea.""I'll read the leaves, if you want,"" said Miss Spink to Coraline.""Sorry?"" said Coraline.""The tea leaves, dear. I'll read your future.""Coraline passed Miss Spink her cup. Miss Spink peered shortsightedly at the black tea leaves in the bottom. She pursed her lips.""You know, Caroline,"" she said, after a while, ""you are in terrible danger.""Miss Forcible snorted, and put down her knitting. ""Don't be silly, April. Stop scaring the girl. Your eyes are going. Pass me that cup, child.""Coraline carried the cup over to Miss Forcible. Miss Forcible looked into it carefully, shook her head, and looked into it again.""Oh dear,"" she said. ""You were right, April. She is in danger.""""See, Miriam,"" said Miss Spink triumphantly. ""My eyes are as good as they ever were... .""""What am I in danger from?"" asked Coraline.Misses Spink and Forcible stared at her blankly. ""It didn't say,"" said Miss Spink. ""Tea leaves aren't reliable for that kind of thing. Not really. They're good for general, but not for specifics.""""What should I do then?"" asked Coraline, who was slightly alarmed by this.""Don't wear green in your dressing room,"" suggested Miss Spink.""Or mention the Scottish play,"" added Miss Forcible.Coraline wondered why so few of the adults she had met made any sense. She sometimes wondered who they thought they were talking to.""And be very, very careful,"" said Miss Spink. She got up from the armchair and went over to the fireplace. On the mantelpiece was a small jar, and Miss Spink took off the top of the jar and began to pull things out of it. There was a tiny china duck, a thimble, a strange little brass coin, two paper clips and a stone with a hole in it.She passed Coraline the stone with a hole in it.""What's it for?"" asked Coraline. The hole went all the way through the middle of the stone. She held it up to the window and looked through it.""It might help,"" said Miss Spink. ""They're good for bad things, sometimes.""Coraline put on her coat, said good-bye to Misses Spink and Forcible and to the dogs, and went outside.The mist hung like blindness around the house. She walked slowly to the stairs up to her family's flat, and then stopped and looked around.In the mist, it was a ghost-world. In danger? thought Coraline to herself. It sounded exciting. It didn't sound like a bad thing. Not really.Coraline went back upstairs, her fist closed tightly around her new stone.
CL_ch3	CL	Coraline	3	1955	11287	III.THE NEXT DAY THE sun shone, and Coraline's mother took her into the nearest large town to buy clothes for school. They dropped her father off at the railway station. He was going into London for the day to see some people.Coraline waved him good-bye.They went to the department store to buy the school clothes.Coraline saw some Day-Glo green gloves she liked a lot. Her mother refused to buy them for her, preferring instead to buy white socks, navy blue school underpants, four gray blouses, and a dark gray skirt.""But Mum, everybody at school's got gray blouses and everything. Nobody's got green gloves. I could be the only one.""Her mother ignored her; she was talking to the shop assistant. They were talking about which kind of sweater to get for Coraline, and were agreeing that the best thing to do would be to get one that was embarrassingly large and baggy, in the hopes that one day she might grow into it.Coraline wandered off and looked at a display of Wellington boots shaped like frogs and ducks and rabbits.Then she wandered back.""Coraline? Oh, there you are. Where on earth were you?""""I was kidnapped by aliens,"" said Coraline. ""They came down from outer space with ray guns, but I fooled them by wearing a wig and laughing in a foreign accent, and I escaped.""""Yes, dear. Now, I think you could do with some more hair clips, don't you?""""No.""""Well, let's say half a dozen, to be on the safe side,"" said her mother.Coraline didn't say anything.In the car on the way back home, Coraline said, ""What's in the empty flat?""""I don't know. Nothing, I expect. It probably looks like our flat before we moved in. Empty rooms.""""Do you think you could get into it from our flat?""""Not unless you can walk through bricks, dear.""""Oh.""They got home around lunchtime. The sun was shining, although the day was cold. Coraline's mother looked in the fridge and found a sad little tomato and a piece of cheese with green stuff growing on it. There was only a crust in the bread bin.""I'd better dash down to the shops and get some fish fingers or something,"" said her mother. ""Do you want to come?""""No,"" said Coraline.""Suit yourself,"" said her mother, and left. Then she came back and got her purse and car keys and went out again.Coraline was bored.She flipped through a book her mother was reading about native people in a distant country; how every day they would take pieces of white silk and draw on them in wax, then dip the silks in dye, then draw on them more in wax and dye them some more, then boil the wax out in hot water, and then finally, throw the now-beautiful cloths on a fire and burn them to ashes.It seemed particularly pointless to Coraline, but she hoped that the people enjoyed it.She was still bored, and her mother wasn't yet home.Coraline got a chair and pushed it over to the kitchen door. She climbed onto the chair and reached up. She got down, then got a broom from the broom cupboard. She climbed back on the chair again and reached up with the broom.Chink.She climbed down from the chair and picked up the keys. She smiled triumphantly. Then she leaned the broom against the wall and went into the drawing room.The family did not use the drawing room. They had inherited the furniture from Coraline's grandmother, along with a wooden coffee table, a side table, a heavy glass ashtray, and the oil painting of a bowl of fruit. Coraline could never work out why anyone would want to paint a bowl of fruit. Other than that, the room was empty: there were no knickknacks on the mantelpiece, no statues or clocks; nothing that made it feel comfortable or lived-in.The old black key felt colder than any of the others. She pushed it into the keyhole. It turned smoothly, with a satisfying clunk.Coraline stopped and listened. She knew she was doing something wrong, and she was trying to listen for her mother coming back, but she heard nothing. Then Coraline put her hand on the doorknob and turned it; and, finally, she opened the door.It opened on to a dark hallway. The bricks had gone as if they'd never been there. There was a cold, musty smell coming through the open doorway: it smelled like something very old and very slow.Coraline went through the door.She wondered what the empty flat would be like-if that was where the corridor led.Coraline walked down the corridor uneasily. There was something very familiar about it.The carpet beneath her feet was the same carpet they had in her flat. The wallpaper was the same wallpaper they had. The picture hanging in the hall was the same that they had hanging in their hallway at home.She knew where she was: she was in her own home. She hadn't left.She shook her head, confused.She stared at the picture hanging on the wall: no, it wasn't exactly the same. The picture they had in their own hallway showed a boy in old-fashioned clothes staring at some bubbles. But now the expression on his face was different-he was looking at the bubbles as if he was planning to do something very nasty indeed to them. And there was something peculiar about his eyes.Coraline stared at his eyes, trying to figure out what exactly was different.She almost had it when somebody said, ""Coraline?""It sounded like her mother. Coraline went into the kitchen, where the voice had come from. A woman stood in the kitchen with her back to Coraline. She looked a little like Coraline's mother. Only...Only her skin was white as paper.Only she was taller and thinner.Only her fingers were too long, and they never stopped moving, and her dark red fingernails were curved and sharp.""Coraline?"" the woman said. ""Is that you?""And then she turned around. Her eyes were big black buttons.""Lunchtime, Coraline,"" said the woman.""Who are you?"" asked Coraline.""I'm your other mother,"" said the woman. ""Go and tell your other father that lunch is ready,"" She opened the door of the oven. Suddenly Coraline realized how hungry she was. It smelled wonderful. ""Well, go on.""Coraline went down the hall, to where her father's study was. She opened the door. There was a man in there, sitting at the keyboard, with his back to her. ""Hello,"" said Coraline. ""I-I mean, she said to say that lunch is ready.""The man turned around.His eyes were buttons, big and black and shiny.""Hello Coraline,"" he said. ""I'm starving.""He got up and went with her into the kitchen. They sat at the kitchen table, and Coraline's other mother brought them lunch. A huge, golden-brown roasted chicken, fried potatoes, tiny green peas. Coraline shoveled the food into her mouth. It tasted wonderful.""We've been waiting for you for a long time,"" said Coraline's other father.""For me?""""Yes,"" said the other mother. ""It wasn't the same here without you. But we knew you'd arrive one day, and then we could be a proper family. Would you like some more chicken?""It was the best chicken that Coraline had ever eaten. Her mother sometimes made chicken, but it was always out of packets or frozen, and was very dry, and it never tasted of anything. When Coraline's father cooked chicken he bought real chicken, but he did strange things to it, like stewing it in wine, or stuffing it with prunes, or baking it in pastry, and Coraline would always refuse to touch it on principle.She took some more chicken.""I didn't know I had another mother,"" said Coraline, cautiously.""Of course you do. Everyone does,"" said the other mother, her black button eyes gleaming. ""After lunch I thought you might like to play in your room with the rats.""""The rats?""""From upstairs.""Coraline had never seen a rat, except on television. She was quite looking forward to it. This was turning out to be a very interesting day after all.After lunch her other parents did the washing up, and Coraline went down the hall to her other bedroom.It was different from her bedroom at home. For a start it was painted in an off-putting shade of green and a peculiar shade of pink.Coraline decided that she wouldn't want to have to sleep in there, but that the color scheme was an awful lot more interesting than her own bedroom.There were all sorts of remarkable things in there she'd never seen before: windup angels that fluttered around the bedroom like startled sparrows; books with pictures that writhed and crawled and shimmered; little dinosaur skulls that chattered their teeth as she passed. A whole toy box filled with wonderful toys.This is more like it, thought Coraline. She looked out of the window. Outside, the view was the same one she saw from her own bedroom: trees, fields, and beyond them, on the horizon, distant purple hills.Something black scurried across the floor and vanished under the bed. Coraline got down on her knees and looked under the bed. Fifty little red eyes stared back at her.""Hello,"" said Coraline. ""Are you the rats?""They came out from under the bed, blinking their eyes in the light. They had short, soot-black fur, little red eyes, pink paws like tiny hands, and pink, hairless tails like long, smooth worms.""Can you talk?"" she asked.The largest, blackest of the rats shook its head. It had an unpleasant sort of smile, Coraline thought.""Well,"" asked Coraline, ""what do you do?""The rats formed a circle.Then they began to climb on top of each other, carefully but swiftly, until they had formed a pyramid with the largest rat at the top.The rats began to sing, in high, whispery voices,We have teeth and we have tailsWe have tails we have eyesWe were here before you fellYou will be here when we rise.It wasn't a pretty song. Coraline was sure she'd heard it before, or something like it, although she was unable to remember exactly where.Then the pyramid fell apart, and the rats scampered, fast and black, toward the door.The other crazy old man upstairs was standing in the doorway, holding a tall black hat in his hands. The rats scampered up him, burrowing into his pockets, into his shirt, up his trouser legs, down his neck.The largest rat climbed onto the old man's shoulders, swung up on the long gray mustache, past the big black button eyes, and onto the top of the man's head.In seconds the only evidence that the rats were there at all were the restless lumps under the man's clothes, forever sliding from place to place across him; and there was still the largest rat, who stared down, with glittering red eyes, at Coraline from the man's head.The old man put his hat on, and the last rat was gone.""Hello Coraline,"" said the other old man upstairs. ""I heard you were here. It is time for the rats to have their dinner. But you can come up with me, if you like, and watch them feed.""There was something hungry in the old man's button eyes that made Coraline feel uncomfortable. ""No, thank you,"" she said. ""I'm going outside to explore.""The old man nodded, very slowly. Coraline could hear the rats whispering to each other, although she could not tell what they were saying.She was not certain that she wanted to know what they were saying.Her other parents stood in the kitchen doorway as she walked down the corridor, smiling identical smiles, and waving slowly. ""Have a nice time outside,"" said her other mother.""We'll just wait here for you to come back,"" said her other father.When Coraline got to the front door, she turned back and looked at them. They were still watching her, and waving, and smiling.Coraline walked outside, and down the steps.
CL_ch4	CL	Coraline	4	2363	13784	IV.The house looked exactly the same from the outside. Or almost exactly the same: around Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's door were blue and red lightbulbs that flashed on and off spelling out words, the lights chasing each other around the door. On and off, around and around. astounding! was followed by a theatrical and then triumph!!!It was a sunny, cold day, exactly like the one she'd left.There was a polite noise from behind her.She turned around. Standing on the wall next to her was a large black cat, identical to the large black cat she'd seen in the grounds at home.""Good afternoon,"" said the cat.Its voice sounded like the voice at the back of Coraline's head, the voice she thought words in, but a man's voice, not a girl's.""Hello,"" said Coraline. ""I saw a cat like you in the garden at home. You must be the other cat.""The cat shook its head. ""No,"" it said. ""I'm not the other anything. I'm me."" It tipped its head to one side; green eyes glinted. ""You people are spread all over the place. Cats, on the other hand, keep ourselves together. If you see what I mean.""""I suppose. But if you're the same cat I saw at home, how can you talk?""Cats don't have shoulders, not like people do. But the cat shrugged, in one smooth movement that started at the tip of its tail and ended in a raised movement of its whiskers. ""I can talk.""""Cats don't talk at home.""""No?"" said the cat.""No,"" said Coraline.The cat leaped smoothly from the wall to the grass near Coraline's feet. It stared up at her.""Well, you're the expert on these things,"" said the cat dryly. ""After all, what would I know? I'm only a cat.""It began to walk away, head and tail held high and proud.""Come back,"" said Coraline. ""Please. I'm sorry. I really am.""The cat stopped walking, sat down, and began to wash itself thoughtfully, apparently unaware of Coraline's existence.""We...we could be friends, you know,"" said Coraline.""We could be rare specimens of an exotic breed of African dancing elephants,"" said the cat. ""But we're not. At least,"" it added cattily, after darting a brief look at Coraline, ""I'm not.""Coraline sighed.""Please. What's your name?"" Coraline asked the cat. ""Look, I'm Coraline. Okay?""The cat yawned slowly, carefully, revealing a mouth and tongue of astounding pinkness. ""Cats don't have names,"" it said.""No?"" said Coraline.""No,"" said the cat. ""Now, you people have names. That's because you don't know who you are. We know who we are, so we don't need names.""There was something irritatingly self-centered about the cat, Coraline decided. As if it were, in its opinion, the only thing in any world or place that could possibly be of any importance.Half of her wanted to be very rude to it; the other half of her wanted to be polite and deferential. The polite half won.""Please, what is this place?""The cat glanced around briefly. ""It's here,"" said the cat.""I can see that. Well, how did you get here?""""Like you did. I walked,"" said the cat. ""Like this.""Coraline watched as the cat walked slowly across the lawn. It walked behind a tree, but didn't come out the other side. Coraline went over to the tree and looked behind it. The cat was gone.She walked back toward the house. There was another polite noise from behind her. It was the cat.""By the by,"" it said. ""It was sensible of you to bring protection. I'd hang on to it, if I were you.""""Protection?""""That's what I said,"" said the cat. ""And anyway-""It paused, and stared intently at something that wasn't there.Then it went down into a low crouch and moved slowly forward, two or three steps. It seemed to be stalking an invisible mouse. Abruptly, it turned tail and dashed for the woods.It vanished among the trees.Coraline wondered what the cat had meant.She also wondered whether cats could all talk where she came from and just chose not to, or whether they could only talk when they were here-wherever here was.She walked down the brick steps to the Misses Spink and Forcible's front door. The blue and red lights flashed on and off.The door was open, just slightly. She knocked on it, but her first knock made the door swing open, and Coraline went in.She was in a dark room that smelled of dust and velvet. The door swung shut behind her, and the room was black. Coraline edged forward into a small anteroom. Her face brushed against something soft. It was cloth. She reached up her hand and pushed at the cloth. It parted.She stood blinking on the other side of the velvet curtains, in a poorly lit theater. Far away, at the edge of the room, was a high wooden stage, empty and bare, a dim spotlight shining onto it from high above.There were seats between Coraline and the stage. Rows and rows of seats. She heard a shuffling noise, and a light came toward her, swinging from side to side. When it was closer she saw the light was coming from a flashlight being carried in the mouth of a large black Scottie dog, its muzzle gray with age.""Hello,"" said Coraline.The dog put the flashlight down on the floor, and looked up at her. ""Right. Let's see your ticket,"" he said gruffly.""Ticket?""""That's what I said. Ticket. I haven't got all day, you know. You can't watch the show without a ticket.""Coraline sighed. ""I don't have a ticket,"" she admitted.""Another one,"" said the dog gloomily. ""Come in here, bold as anything. 'Where's your ticket?' 'Haven't got one,' I don't know..."" It shook its head, then shrugged. ""Come on, then.""He picked up the flashlight in his mouth and trotted off into the dark. Coraline followed him. When he got near the front of the stage he stopped and shone the flashlight onto an empty seat. Coraline sat down, and the dog wandered off.As her eyes got used to the darkness she realized that the other inhabitants of the seats were also dogs.There was a sudden hissing noise from behind the stage. Coraline decided it was the sound of a scratchy old record being put onto a record player. The hissing became the noise of trumpets, and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible came onto the stage.Miss Spink was riding a one-wheeled bicycle and juggling balls. Miss Forcible skipped behind her, holding a basket of flowers. She scattered the flower petals across the stage as she went. They reached the front of the stage, and Miss Spink leaped nimbly off the unicycle, and the two old women bowed low.All the dogs thumped their tails and barked enthusiastically. Coraline clapped politely.Then they unbuttoned their fluffy round coats and opened them. But their coats weren't all that opened: their faces opened, too, like empty shells, and out of the old empty fluffy round bodies stepped two young women. They were thin, and pale, and quite pretty, and had black button eyes.The new Miss Spink was wearing green tights, and high brown boots that went most of the way up her legs. The new Miss Forcible wore a white dress and had flowers in her long yellow hair.Coraline pressed back against her seat.Miss Spink went off the stage, and the noise of trumpets squealed as the gramophone needle dug its way across the record, and was pulled off.""This is my favorite bit,"" whispered the little dog in the seat next to her.The other Miss Forcible picked a knife out of a box on the corner of the stage. ""Is this a dagger that I see before me?"" she asked.""Yes!"" shouted all the little dogs. ""It is!"" Miss Forcible curtsied, and all the dogs applauded again. Coraline didn't bother clapping this time.Miss Spink came back on. She slapped her thigh, and all the little dogs woofed.""And now,"" Miss Spink said, ""Miriam and I proudly present a new and exciting addendum to our theatrical exposition. Do I see a volunteer?""The little dog next to Coraline nudged her with its front paw. ""That's you,"" it hissed.Coraline stood up, and walked up the wooden steps to the stage.""Can I have big round of applause for the young volunteer?"" asked Miss Spink. The dogs woofed and squealed and thumped their tails on the velvet seats.""Now Coraline,"" said Miss Spink, ""what's your name?""""Coraline,"" said Coraline.""And we don't know each other, do we?""Coraline looked at the thin young woman with black button eyes and shook her head slowly.""Now,"" said the other Miss Spink, ""stand over here."" She led Coraline over to a board by the side of the stage, and put a balloon on top of Coraline's head.Miss Spink walked over to Miss Forcible. She blindfolded Miss Forcible's button eyes with a black scarf, and put the knife into her hands. Then she turned her round three or four times and pointed her at Coraline. Coraline held her breath and squeezed her fingers into two tight fists.Miss Forcible threw the knife at the balloon. It popped loudly, and the knife stuck into the board just above Coraline's head and twanged there. Coraline breathed out.The dogs went wild.Miss Spink gave Coraline a very small box of chocolates and thanked her for being such a good sport. Coraline went back to her seat.""You were very good,"" said the little dog.""Thank you,"" said Coraline.Miss Forcible and Miss Spink began juggling with huge wooden clubs. Coraline opened the box of chocolates. The dog looked at them longingly.""Would you like one?"" she asked the little dog.""Yes, please,"" whispered the dog. ""Only not toffee ones. They make me drool.""""I thought chocolates weren't very good for dogs,"" she said, remembering something Miss Forcible had once told her.""Maybe where you come from,"" whispered the little dog. ""Here, it's all we eat.""Coraline couldn't see what the chocolates were, in the dark. She took an experimental bite of one which turned out to be coconut. Coraline didn't like coconut. She gave it to the dog.""Thank you,"" said the dog.""You're welcome,"" said Coraline.Miss Forcible and Miss Spink were doing some acting. Miss Forcible was sitting on a stepladder, and Miss Spink was standing at the bottom.""What's in a name?"" asked Miss Forcible. ""That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.""""Have you got any more chocolates?"" said the dog.Coraline gave the dog another chocolate.""I know not how to tell thee who I am,"" said Miss Spink to Miss Forcible.""This bit finishes soon,"" whispered the dog. ""Then they start folk dancing.""""How long does this go on for?"" asked Coraline. ""The theater?""""All the time,"" said the dog. ""For ever and always.""""Here,"" said Coraline. ""Keep the chocolates.""""Thank you,"" said the dog. Coraline stood up.""See you soon,"" said the dog.""Bye,"" said Coraline. She walked out of the theater and back into the garden. She had to blink her eyes at the daylight.Her other parents were waiting for her in the garden, standing side by side. They were smiling.""Did you have a nice time?"" asked her other mother.""It was interesting,"" said Coraline.The three of them walked back up to Coraline's other house together. Coraline's other mother stroked Coraline's hair with her long white fingers. Coraline shook her head. ""Don't do that,"" said Coraline.Her other mother took her hand away.""So,"" said her other father. ""Do you like it here?""""I suppose,"" said Coraline. ""It's much more interesting than at home.""They went inside.""I'm glad you like it,"" said Coraline's mother. ""Because we'd like to think that this is your home. You can stay here for ever and always. If you want to.""""Hmm,"" said Coraline. She put her hand in her pockets, and thought about it. Her hand touched the stone that the real Misses Spink and Forcible had given her the day before, the stone with the hole in it.""If you want to stay,"" said her other father, ""there's only one little thing we'll have to do, so you can stay here for ever and always.""They went into the kitchen. On a china plate on the kitchen table was a spool of black cotton, and a long silver needle, and, beside them, two large black buttons.""I don't think so,"" said Coraline.""Oh, but we want you to,"" said her other mother. ""We want you to stay. And it's just a little thing.""""It won't hurt,"" said her other father.Coraline knew that when grown-ups told you something wouldn't hurt it almost always did. She shook her head.Her other mother smiled brightly and the hair on her head drifted like plants under the sea. ""We only want what's best for you,"" she said.She put her hand on Coraline's shoulder. Coraline backed away.""I'm going now,"" said Coraline. She put her hands in her pockets. Her fingers closed around the stone with the hole in it.Her other mother's hand scuttled off Coraline's shoulder like a frightened spider.""If that's what you want,"" she said.""Yes,"" said Coraline.""We'll see you soon, though,"" said her other father. ""When you come back.""""Um,"" said Coraline.""And then we'll all be together as one big happy family,"" said her other mother. ""For ever and always.""Coraline backed away. She turned and hurried into the drawing room and pulled open the door in the corner. There was no brick wall there now-just darkness, a night-black underground darkness that seemed as if things in it might be moving.Coraline hesitated. She turned back. Her other mother and her other father were walking toward her, holding hands. They were looking at her with their black button eyes. Or at least she thought they were looking at her. She couldn't be sure.Her other mother reached out her free hand and beckoned, gently, with one white finger. Her pale lips mouthed, ""Come back soon,"" although she said nothing aloud.Coraline took a deep breath and stepped into the darkness, where strange voices whispered and distant winds howled. She became certain that there was something in the dark behind her: something very old and very slow. Her heart beat so hard and so loudly she was scared it would burst out of her chest. She closed her eyes against the dark.Eventually she bumped into something, and opened her eyes, startled. She had bumped into an armchair, in her drawing room.The open doorway behind her was blocked by rough red bricks.She was home.
CL_ch5	CL	Coraline	5	3726	20719	V.CORALINE LOCKED THE DOOR of the drawing room with the cold black key.She went back into the kitchen and climbed onto a chair. She tried to put the bunch of keys back on top of the doorframe again. She tried four or five times before she was forced to accept that she just wasn't big enough, and she put them down on the counter next to the door.Her mother still hadn't returned from her shopping expedition.Coraline went to the freezer and took out the spare loaf of frozen bread in the bottom compartment. She made herself some toast, with jam and peanut butter. She drank a glass of water.She waited for her parents to come back.When it began to get dark, Coraline microwaved herself a frozen pizza.Then Coraline watched television. She wondered why grown-ups gave themselves all the good programs, with all the shouting and running around in.After a while she started yawning. Then she undressed, brushed her teeth, and put herself to bed.In the morning she went into her parents' room, but their bed hadn't been slept in, and they weren't around. She ate canned spaghetti for breakfast.For lunch she had a block of cooking chocolate and an apple. The apple was yellow and slightly shriveled, but it tasted sweet and good.For tea she went down to see Misses Spink and Forcible. She had three digestive biscuits, a glass of limeade, and a cup of weak tea. The limeade was very interesting. It didn't taste anything like limes. It tasted bright green and vaguely chemical. Coraline liked it enormously. She wished they had it at home.""How are your dear mother and father?"" asked Miss Spink.""Missing,"" said Coraline. ""I haven't seen either of them since yesterday. I'm on my own. I think I've probably become a single child family.""""Tell your mother that we found the Glasgow Empire press clippings we were telling her about. She seemed very interested when Miriam mentioned them to her.""""She's vanished under mysterious circumstances,"" said Coraline, ""and I believe my father has as well.""""I'm afraid we'll be out all day tomorrow, Caroline, luvvy,"" said Miss Forcible. ""We'll be staying over with April's niece in Royal Tunbridge Wells.""They showed Coraline a photographic album, with photographs of Miss Spink's niece in it, and then Coraline went home.She opened her money box and walked down to the supermarket. She bought two large bottles of limeade, a chocolate cake, and a new bag of apples, and went back home and ate them for dinner.She cleaned her teeth, and went into her father's office. She woke up his computer and wrote a story.CORALINE'S STORY.THERE WAS A GIRL HER NAME WAS APPLE. SHE USED TO DANCE A LOT. SHE DANCED AND DANCED UNTIL HER FEET TURND INTO SOSSAJES THE END.She printed out the story and turned off the computer. Then she drew a picture of the little girl dancing underneath the words on the paper.She ran herself a bath with too much bubble bath in it, and the bubbles ran over the side and went all over the floor. She dried herself, and the floor as best she could, and went to bed.Coraline woke up in the night. She went into her parents' bedroom, but the bed was made and empty. The glowing green numbers on the digital clock glowed 3:12 A.M.All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was no other sound in the empty flat.She climbed into her parents' bed, and, after a while, she went to sleep.Coraline was woken by cold paws batting her face. She opened her eyes. Big green eyes stared back at her. It was the cat.""Hullo,"" said Coraline. ""How did you get in?""The cat didn't say anything. Coraline got out of bed. She was wearing a long T-shirt and pajama bottoms. ""Have you come to tell me something?""The cat yawned, which made its eyes flash green.""Do you know where Mummy and Daddy are?""The cat blinked at her, slowly.""Is that a yes?""The cat blinked again. Coraline decided that that was indeed a yes. ""Will you take me to them?""The cat stared at her. Then it walked out into the hall. She followed it. It walked the length of the corridor and stopped down at the very end, where a full-length mirror hung. The mirror had been, a long time before, the inside of a wardrobe door. It had been hanging there on the wall when they moved in, and, although Coraline's mother had spoken occasionally of replacing it with something newer, she never had.Coraline turned on the light in the hall.The mirror showed the corridor behind her; that was only to be expected. But reflected in the mirror were her parents. They stood awkwardly in the reflection of the hall. They seemed sad and alone. As Coraline watched, they waved to her, slowly, with limp hands. Coraline's father had his arm around her mother.In the mirror Coraline's mother and father stared at her. Her father opened his mouth and said something, but she could hear nothing at all. Her mother breathed on the inside of the mirror glass, and quickly, before the fog faded, she wrotewith the tip of her forefinger. The fog on the inside of the mirror faded, and so did her parents, and now the mirror reflected only the corridor, and Coraline, and the cat.""Where are they?"" Coraline asked the cat. The cat made no reply, but Coraline could imagine its voice, dry as a dead fly on a windowsill in winter, saying Well, where do you think they are?""They aren't going to come back, are they?"" said Coraline. ""Not under their own steam.""The cat blinked at her. Coraline took it as a yes.""Right,"" said Coraline. ""Then I suppose there is only one thing left to do.""She walked into her father's study. She sat down at his desk. Then she picked up the telephone, and she opened the phone book and telephoned the local police station.""Police,"" said a gruff male voice.""Hello,"" she said. ""My name is Coraline Jones.""""You're up a bit after your bedtime, aren't you, young lady?"" said the policeman.""Possibly,"" said Coraline, who was not going to be diverted, ""but I am ringing to report a crime.""""And what sort of crime would that be?""""Kidnapping. Grown-up-napping really. My parents have been stolen away into a world on the other side of the mirror in our hall.""""And do you know who stole them?"" asked the police officer. Coraline could hear the smile in his voice, and she tried extra hard to sound like an adult might sound, to make him take her seriously.""I think my other mother has them both in her clutches. She may want to keep them and sew their eyes with black buttons, or she may simply have them in order to lure me back into reach of her fingers. I'm not sure.""""Ah. The nefarious clutches of her fiendish fingers, is it?"" he said. ""Mm. You know what I suggest, Miss Jones?""""No,"" said Coraline. ""What?""""You ask your mother to make you a big old mug of hot chocolate, and then give you a great big old hug. There's nothing like hot chocolate and a hug for making the nightmares go away. And if she starts to tell you off for waking her up at this time of night, why you tell her that that's what the policeman said."" He had a deep, reassuring voice.Coraline was not reassured.""When I see her,"" said Coraline, ""I shall tell her that."" And she put down the telephone.The black cat, who had sat on the floor, grooming his fur, through this entire conversation now stood up and led the way into the hall.Coraline went back into her bedroom and put on her blue dressing gown and her slippers. She looked under the sink for a flashlight, and found one, but the batteries had long since run down, and it barely glowed with the faintest straw-colored light. She put it down again and found a box of in-case-of-emergency white wax candles, and thrust one into a candlestick. She put an apple into each pocket. She picked up the ring of keys and took the old black key off the ring.She walked into the drawing room and looked at the door. She had the feeling that the door was looking at her, which she knew was silly, and knew on a deeper level was somehow true.She went back into her bedroom, and rummaged in the pocket of her jeans. She found the stone with the hole in it, and put it into her dressing-gown pocket.She lit the candlewick with a match and watched it sputter and light, then she picked up the black key. It was cold in her hand. She put it into the keyhole in the door, but did not turn the key.""When I was a little girl,"" said Coraline to the cat, ""when we lived in our old house, a long, long time ago, my dad took me for a walk on the wasteland between our house and the shops.""It wasn't the best place to go for a walk, really. There were all these things that people had thrown away back there-old cookers and broken dishes and dolls with no arms and no legs and empty cans and broken bottles. Mum and Dad made me promise not to go exploring back there, because there were too many sharp things, and tetanus and such.""But I kept telling them I wanted to explore it. So one day my dad put on his big brown boots and his gloves and put my boots on me and my jeans and sweater, and we went for a walk.""We must have walked for about twenty minutes. We went down this hill, to the bottom of a gully where a stream was, when my dad suddenly said to me, ""Coraline-run away. Up the hill. Now!"" He said it in a tight sort of way, urgently, so I did. I ran away up the hill. Something hurt me on the back of my arm as I ran, but I kept running.""As I got to the top of the hill I heard somebody thundering up the hill behind me. It was my dad, charging like a rhino. When he reached me he picked me up in his arms and swept me over the edge of the hill.""And then we stopped and we puffed and we panted, and we looked back down the gully.""The air was alive with yellow wasps. We must have stepped on a wasps' nest in a rotten branch as we walked. And while I was running up the hill, my dad stayed and got stung, to give me time to run away. His glasses had fallen off when he ran.""I only had the one sting on the back of my arm. He had thirty-nine stings, all over him. We counted later, in the bath.""The black cat began to wash its face and whiskers in a manner that indicated increasing impatience. Coraline reached down and stroked the back of its head and neck. The cat stood up, walked several paces until it was out of her reach, then it sat down and looked up at her again.""So,"" said Coraline, ""later that afternoon my dad went back again to the wasteland, to get his glasses back. He said if he left it another day he wouldn't be able to remember where they'd fallen.""And soon he got home, wearing his glasses. He said that he wasn't scared when he was standing there and the wasps were stinging him and hurting him and he was watching me run away. Because he knew he had to give me enough time to run, or the wasps would have come after both of us.""Coraline turned the key in the door. It turned with a loud clunk.The door swung open.There was no brick wall on the other side of the door: only darkness. A cold wind blew through the passageway.Coraline made no move to walk through the door.""And he said that wasn't brave of him, doing that, just standing there and being stung,"" said Coraline to the cat. ""It wasn't brave because he wasn't scared: it was the only thing he could do. But going back again to get his glasses, when he knew the wasps were there, when he was really scared. That was brave.""She took her first step down the dark corridor.She could smell dust and damp and mustiness.The cat padded along beside her.""And why was that?"" asked the cat, although it sounded barely interested.""Because,"" she said, ""when you're scared but you still do it anyway, that's brave.""The candle cast huge, strange, flickering shadows along the wall. She heard something moving in the darkness-beside her or to one side of her, she could not tell. It seemed as if it was keeping pace with her, whatever it was.""And that's why you're going back to her world, then?"" said the cat. ""Because your father once saved you from wasps?""""Don't be silly,"" said Coraline. ""I'm going back for them because they are my parents. And if they noticed I was gone I'm sure they would do the same for me. You know you're talking again?""""How fortunate I am,"" said the cat, ""in having a traveling companion of such wisdom and intelligence."" Its tone remained sarcastic, but its fur was bristling, and its brush of a tail stuck up in the air.Coraline was going to say something, like sorry or wasn't it a lot shorter walk last time? when the candle went out as suddenly as if it had been snuffed by someone's hand.There was a scrabbling and a pattering, and Coraline could feel her heart pounding against her ribs. She put out one hand...and felt something wispy, like a spider's web, brush her hands and her face.At the end of the corridor the electric light went on, blinding after the darkness. A woman stood, silhouetted by the light, a little ahead of Coraline.""Coraline? Darling?"" she called.""Mum!"" said Coraline, and she ran forward, eager and relieved.""Darling,"" said the woman. ""Why did you ever run away from me?""Coraline was too close to stop, and she felt the other mother's cold arms enfold her. She stood there, rigid and trembling as the other mother held her tightly.""Where are my parents?"" Coraline asked.""We're here,"" said her other mother, in a voice so close to her real mother's that Coraline could scarcely tell them apart. ""We're here. We're ready to love you and play with you and feed you and make your life interesting.""Coraline pulled back, and the other mother let her go, with reluctance.The other father, who had been sitting on a chair in the hallway, stood up and smiled. ""Come on into the kitchen,"" he said. ""I'll make us a midnight snack. And you'll want something to drink-hot chocolate perhaps?""Coraline walked down the hallway until she reached the mirror at the end. There was nothing reflected in it but a young girl in her dressing gown and slippers, who looked like she had recently been crying but whose eyes were real eyes, not black buttons, and who was holding tightly to a burned-out candle in a candlestick.She looked at the girl in the mirror and the girl in the mirror looked back at her.I will be brave, thought Coraline. No, I am brave.She put down the candlestick on the floor, then turned around. The other mother and the other father were looking at her hungrily""I don't need a snack,"" she said. ""I have an apple. See?"" And she took an apple from her dressing-gown pocket, then bit into it with relish and an enthusiasm that she did not really feel.The other father looked disappointed. The other mother smiled, showing a full set of teeth, and each of the teeth was a tiny bit too long. The lights in the hallway made her black button eyes glitter and gleam.""You don't frighten me,"" said Coraline, although they did frighten her, very much. ""I want my parents back.""The world seemed to shimmer a little at the edges.""Whatever would I have done with your old parents? If they have left you, Coraline, it must be because they became bored of you, or tired. Now, I will never become bored of you, and I will never abandon you. You will always be safe here with me."" The other mother's wet-looking black hair drifted around her head, like the tentacles of a creature in the deep ocean.""They weren't bored of me,"" said Coraline. ""You're lying. You stole them.""""Silly, silly Coraline. They are fine wherever they are.""Coraline simply glared at the other mother.""I'll prove it,"" said the other mother, and brushed the surface of the mirror with her long white fingers. It clouded over, as if a dragon had breathed on it, and then it cleared.In the mirror it was daytime already. Coraline was looking at the hallway, all the way down to her front door. The door opened from the outside and Coraline's mother and father walked inside. They carried suitcases.""That was a fine holiday,"" said Coraline's father.""How nice it is, not to have Coraline any more,"" said her mother with a happy smile. ""Now we can do all the things we always wanted to do, like go abroad, but were prevented from doing by having a little daughter.""""And,"" said her father, ""I take great comfort in knowing that her other mother will take better care of her than we ever could.""The mirror fogged and faded and reflected the night once more.""See?"" said her other mother.""No,"" said Coraline. ""I don't see. And I don't believe it either.""She hoped that what she had just seen was not real, but she was not as certain as she sounded. There was a tiny doubt inside her, like a maggot in an apple core. Then she looked up and saw the expression on her other mother's face: a flash of real anger, which crossed her face like summer lightning, and Coraline was sure in her heart that what she had seen in the mirror was no more than an illusion.Coraline sat down on the sofa and ate her apple.""Please,"" said her other mother. ""Don't be difficult."" She walked into the drawing room and clapped her hands twice. There was a rustling noise and a black rat appeared. It stared up at her. ""Bring me the key,"" she said.The rat chittered, then it ran through the open door that led back to Coraline's own flat.The rat returned, dragging the key behind it.""Why don't you have your own key on this side?"" asked Coraline.""There is only one key. Only one door,"" said the other father.""Hush,"" said the other mother. ""You must not bother our darling Coraline's head with such trivialities."" She put the key in the keyhole and twisted. The lock was stiff, but it clunked closed.She dropped the key into her apron pocket.Outside, the sky had begun to lighten to a luminous gray.""If we aren't going to have a midnight snack,"" said the other mother, ""we still need our beauty sleep. I am going back to bed, Coraline. I would strongly suggest that you do the same.""She placed her long white fingers on the shoulders of the other father, and she walked him out of the room.Coraline walked over to the door at the far corner of the drawing room. She tugged on it, but it was tightly locked. The door of her other parents' bedroom was now closed.She was indeed tired, but she did not want to sleep in the bedroom. She did not want to sleep under the same roof as her other mother.The front door was not locked. Coraline walked out into the dawn and down the stone stairs. She sat down on the bottom step. It was cold.Something furry pushed itself against her side in one smooth, insinuating motion. Coraline jumped, then breathed a sigh of relief when she saw what it was.""Oh. It's you,"" she said to the black cat.""See?"" said the cat. ""It wasn't so hard recognizing me, was it? Even without names.""""Well, what if I wanted to call you?""The cat wrinkled its nose and managed to look unimpressed. ""Calling cats,"" it confided, ""tends to be a rather overrated activity. Might as well call a whirlwind.""""What if it was dinnertime?"" asked Coraline. ""Wouldn't you want to be called then?""""Of course,"" said the cat. ""But a simple cry of 'dinner!' would do nicely. See? No need for names.""""Why does she want me?"" Coraline asked the cat. ""Why does she want me to stay here with her?""""She wants something to love, I think,"" said the cat. ""Something that isn't her. She might want something to eat as well. It's hard to tell with creatures like that.""""Do you have any advice?"" asked Coraline.The cat looked as if it were about to say something else sarcastic. Then it flicked its whiskers and said, ""Challenge her. There's no guarantee she'll play fair, but her kind of thing loves games and challenges.""""What kind of thing is that?"" asked Coraline.But the cat made no answer, simply stretched luxuriantly and walked away. Then it stopped, and turned, and said, ""I'd go inside if I were you. Get some sleep. You have a long day ahead of you.""And then the cat was gone. Still, Coraline realized, it had a point. She crept back into the silent house, past the closed bedroom door inside which the other mother and the other father...what? she wondered. Slept? Waited? And then it came to her that, should she open the bedroom door she would find it empty, or more precisely, that it was an empty room and it would remain empty until the exact moment that she opened the door.Somehow, that made it easier. Coraline walked into the green-and-pink parody of her own bedroom. She closed the door and hauled the toy box in front of it-it would not keep anyone out, but the noise somebody would make trying to dislodge it would wake her, she hoped.The toys in the toy box were still mostly asleep, and they stirred and muttered as she moved their box, and then they went back to sleep. Coraline checked under her bed, looking for rats, but there was nothing there. She took off her dressing gown and slippers and climbed into bed and fell asleep with barely enough time to reflect, as she did so, on what the cat could have meant by a challenge.
CL_ch6	CL	Coraline	6	2608	14504	VI.CORALINE WAS WOKEN BY the midmorning sun, full on her face.For a moment she felt utterly dislocated. She did not know where she was; she was not entirely sure who she was. It is astonishing just how much of what we are can be tied to the beds we wake up in in the morning, and it is astonishing how fragile that can be.Sometimes Coraline would forget who she was while she was daydreaming that she was exploring the Arctic, or the Amazon rain forest, or Darkest Africa, and it was not until someone tapped her on the shoulder or said her name that Coraline would come back from a million miles away with a start, and all in a fraction of a second have to remember who she was, and what her name was, and that she was even there at all.Now there was sun on her face, and she was Coraline Jones. Yes. And then the green and pinkness of the room she was in, and the rustling of a large painted paper butterfly as it fluttered and beat its way about the ceiling, told her where she had woken up.She climbed out of the bed. She could not wear her pajamas, dressing gown, and slippers during the day, she decided, even if it meant wearing the other Coraline's clothes. (Was there an other Coraline? No, she realized, there wasn't. There was just her.) There were no regular clothes in the cupboard, though. They were more like dressing-up clothes or (she thought) the kind of clothes she would love to have hanging in her own wardrobe at home: there was a raggedy witch costume; a patched scarecrow costume; a future-warrior costume with little digital lights in it that glittered and blinked; a slinky evening dress all covered in feathers and mirrors. Finally, in a drawer, she found a pair of black jeans that seemed to be made of velvet night, and a gray sweater the color of thick smoke with faint and tiny stars in the fabric which twinkled.She pulled on the jeans and the sweater. Then she put on a pair of bright orange boots she found at the bottom of the cupboard.She took her last apple out of the pocket of her dressing gown and then took, from the same pocket, the stone with the hole in it.She put the stone into the pocket of her jeans, and it was as if her head had cleared a little. As if she had come out of some sort of a fog.She went into the kitchen, but it was deserted.Still, she was sure that there was someone in the flat. She walked down the hall until she reached her father's study, and discovered that it was occupied.""Where's the other mother?"" she asked the other father. He was sitting in the study, at a desk which looked just like her father's, but he was not doing anything at all, not even reading gardening catalogs as her own father did when he was only pretending to be working.""Out,"" he told her. ""Fixing the doors. There are some vermin problems."" He seemed pleased to have somebody to talk to.""The rats, you mean?""""No, the rats are our friends. This is the other kind. Big black fellow, with his tail high.""""The cat, you mean?""""That's the one,"" said her other father.He looked less like her true father today. There was something slightly vague about his face-like bread dough that had begun to rise, smoothing out the bumps and cracks and depressions.""Really, I mustn't talk to you when she's not here,"" he said. ""But don't you worry. She won't be gone often. I shall demonstrate our tender hospitality to you, such that you will not even think about ever going back."" He closed his mouth and folded his hands in his lap.""So what am I to do now?"" asked Coraline.The other father pointed to his lips. Silence.""If you won't even talk to me,"" said Coraline, ""I am going exploring.""""No point,"" said the other father. ""There isn't anywhere but here. This is all she made: the house, the grounds, and the people in the house. She made it and she waited."" Then he looked embarrassed and he put one finger to his lips again, as if he had just said too much.Coraline walked out of his study. She went into the drawing room, over to the old door, and she pulled it, rattled and shook it. No, it was locked fast, and the other mother had the key.She looked around the room. It was so familiar-that was what made it feel so truly strange. Everything was exactly the same as she remembered: there was all her grandmother's strange-smelling furniture, there was the painting of the bowl of fruit (a bunch of grapes, two plums, a peach and an apple) hanging on the wall, there was the low wooden table with the lion's feet, and the empty fireplace which seemed to suck heat from the room.But there was something else, something she did not remember seeing before. A ball of glass, up on the mantelpiece.She went over to the fireplace, went up on tiptoes, and lifted it down. It was a snow globe, with two little people in it. Coraline shook it and set the snow flying, white snow that glittered as it tumbled through the water.Then she put the snow globe back on the mantelpiece, and carried on looking for her true parents and for a way out.She went out of the flat. Past the flashing-lights door, behind which the other Misses Spink and Forcible performed their show forever, and she set off into the woods.Where Coraline came from, once you were through the patch of trees, you saw nothing but the meadow and the old tennis court. In this place, the woods went on farther, the trees becoming cruder and less treelike the farther you went.Pretty soon they seemed very approximate, like the idea of trees: a grayish-brown trunk below, a greenish splodge of something that might have been leaves above.Coraline wondered if the other mother wasn't interested in trees, or if she just hadn't bothered with this bit properly because nobody was expected to come out this far.She kept walking.And then the mist began.It was not damp, like a normal fog or mist. It was not cold and it was not warm. It felt to Coraline like she was walking into nothing.I'm an explorer, thought Coraline to herself. And I need all the ways out of here that I can get. So I shall keep walking.The world she was walking through was a pale nothingness, like a blank sheet of paper or an enormous, empty white room. It had no temperature, no smell, no texture, and no taste.It certainly isn't mist, thought Coraline, although she did not know what it was. For a moment she wondered if she might not have gone blind. But no, she could see herself, plain as day. But there was no ground beneath her feet, just a misty, milky whiteness.""And what do you think you're doing?"" said a shape to one side of her.It took a few moments for her eyes to focus on it properly: she thought it might be some kind of lion, at first, some distance away from her; and then she thought it might be a mouse, close beside her. And then she knew what it was.""I'm exploring,"" Coraline told the cat.Its fur stood straight out from its body and its eyes were wide, while its tail was down and between its legs. It did not look a happy cat.""Bad place,"" said the cat. ""If you want to call it a place, which I don't. What are you doing here?""""I'm exploring.""""Nothing to find here,"" said the cat. ""This is just the outside, the part of the place she hasn't bothered to create.""""She?""""The one who says she's your other mother,"" said the cat.""What is she?"" asked Coraline.The cat did not answer, just padded through the pale mist beside Coraline.A shape began to appear in front of them, something high and towering and dark.""You were wrong!"" she told the cat. ""There is something there!""And then it took shape in the mist: a dark house, which loomed at them out of the formless whiteness.""But that's-"" said Coraline.""The house you just left,"" agreed the cat. ""Precisely.""""Maybe I just got turned around in the mist,"" said Coraline.The cat curled the high tip of its tail into a question mark, and tipped its head to one side. ""You might have done,"" it said. ""I certainly would not. Wrong, indeed.""""But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?""""Easy,"" said the cat. ""Think of somebody walking around the world. You start out walking away from something and end up coming back to it.""""Small world,"" said Coraline.""It's big enough for her,"" said the cat. ""Spiders' webs only have to be large enough to catch flies.""Coraline shivered.""He said that she's fixing all the gates and the doors,"" she told the cat, ""to keep you out.""""She may try,"" said the cat, unimpressed. ""Oh yes. She may try."" They were standing under a clump of trees now, beside the house. These trees looked much more likely. ""There's ways in and ways out of places like this that even she doesn't know about.""""Did she make this place, then?"" asked Coraline.""Made it, found it-what's the difference?"" asked the cat. ""Either way, she's had it a very long time. Hang on-"" And it gave a shiver and a leap and before Coraline could blink the cat was sitting with its paw holding down a big black rat. ""It's not that I like rats at the best of times,"" said the cat, conversationally, as if nothing had happened, ""but the rats in this place are all spies for her. She uses them as her eyes and hands..."" And with that the cat let the rat go.It ran several feet and then the cat, with one bound, was upon it, batting it hard with one sharp-clawed paw, while with the other paw it held the rat down. ""I love this bit,"" said the cat, happily. ""Want to see me do that again?""""No,"" said Coraline. ""Why do you do it? You're torturing it.""""Mm,"" said the cat. It let the rat go.The rat stumbled, dazed, for a few steps, then it began to run. With a blow of its paw, the cat knocked the rat into the air, and caught it in its mouth.""Stop it!"" said Coraline.The cat dropped the rat between its two front paws. ""There are those,"" it said with a sigh, in tones as smooth as oiled silk, ""who have suggested that the tendency of a cat to play with its prey is a merciful one-after all, it permits the occasional funny little running snack to escape, from time to time. How often does your dinner get to escape?""And then it picked the rat up in its mouth and carried it off into the woods, behind a tree.Coraline walked back into the house.All was quiet and empty and deserted. Even her footsteps on the carpeted floor seemed loud. Dust motes hung in a beam of sunlight.At the far end of the hall was the mirror. She could see herself walking toward the mirror, looking, reflected, a little braver than she actually felt. There was nothing else there in the mirror. Just her, in the corridor.A hand touched her shoulder, and she looked up. The other mother stared down at Coraline with big black button eyes.""Coraline, my darling,"" she said. ""I thought we could play some games together this morning, now you're back from your walk. Hopscotch? Happy Families? Monopoly?""""You weren't in the mirror,"" said Coraline.The other mother smiled. ""Mirrors,"" she said, ""are never to be trusted. Now, what game shall we play?""Coraline shook her head. ""I don't want to play with you,"" she said. ""I want to go home and be with my real parents. I want you to let them go. To let us all go.""The other mother shook her head, very slowly. ""Sharper than a serpent's tooth,"" she said, ""is a daughter's ingratitude. Still, the proudest spirit can be broken, with love."" And her long white fingers waggled and caressed the air.""I have no plans to love you,"" said Coraline. ""No matter what. You can't make me love you.""""Let's talk about it,"" said the other mother, and she turned and walked into the lounge. Coraline followed her.The other mother sat down on the big sofa. She picked up a shopping bag from beside the sofa and took out a white, rustling, paper bag from inside it.She extended the hand with it to Coraline. ""Would you like one?"" she asked politely.Expecting it to be a toffee or a butterscotch ball, Coraline looked down. The bag was half filled with large shiny blackbeetles, crawling over each other in their efforts to get out of the bag.""No,"" said Coraline. ""I don't want one.""""Suit yourself,"" said her other mother. She carefully picked out a particularly large and black beetle, pulled off its legs (which she dropped, neatly, into a big glass ashtray on the small table beside the sofa), and popped the beetle into her mouth. She crunched it happily.""Yum,"" she said, and took another.""You're sick,"" said Coraline. ""Sick and evil and weird.""""Is that any way to talk to your mother?"" her other mother asked, with her mouth full of blackbeetles.""You aren't my mother,"" said Coraline.Her other mother ignored this. ""Now, I think you are a little overexcited, Coraline. Perhaps this afternoon we could do a little embroidery together, or some watercolor painting. Then dinner, and then, if you have been good, you may play with the rats a little before bed. And I shall read you a story and tuck you in, and kiss you good night."" Her long white fingers fluttered gently, like a tired butterfly, and Coraline shivered.""No,"" said Coraline.The other mother sat on the sofa. Her mouth was set in a line; her lips were pursed. She popped another blackbeetle into her mouth and then another, like someone with a bag of chocolate-covered raisins. Her big black button eyes stared into Coraline's hazel eyes. Her shiny black hair twined and twisted about her neck and shoulders, as if it were blowing in some wind that Coraline could not touch or feel.They stared at each other for over a minute. Then the other mother said, ""Manners!"" She folded the white paper bag carefully so no blackbeetles could escape, and she placed it back in the shopping bag. Then she stood up, and up, and up: she seemed taller than Coraline remembered. She reached into her apron pocket and pulled out, first the black door key, which she frowned at and tossed into her shopping bag, then a tiny silver-colored key. She held it up triumphantly. ""There we are,"" she said. ""This is for you, Coraline. For your own good. Because I love you. To teach you manners. Manners makyth man, after all.""She pulled Coraline back into the hallway and advanced upon the mirror at the end of the hall. Then she pushed the tiny key into the fabric of the mirror, and she twisted it.It opened like a door, revealing a dark space behind it. ""You may come out when you've learned some manners,"" said the other mother. ""And when you're ready to be a loving daughter.""She picked Coraline up and pushed her into the dim space behind the mirror. A fragment of beetle was sticking to her lower lip, and there was no expression at all in her black button eyes.Then she swung the mirror door closed, and left Coraline in darkness.
CL_ch7	CL	Coraline	7	1251	6896	VII.SOMEWHERE INSIDE HER Coraline could feel a huge sob welling up. And then she stopped it, before it came out. She took a deep breath and let it go. She put out her hands to touch the space in which she was imprisoned. It was the size of a broom closet: tall enough to stand in or to sit in, not wide or deep enough to lie down in.One wall was glass, and it felt cold to the touch.She went around the tiny room a second time, running her hands over every surface that she could reach, feeling for doorknobs or switches or concealed catches-some kind of way out-and found nothing.A spider scuttled over the back of her hand and she choked back a shriek. But apart from the spider she was alone in the closet in the pitch dark.And then her hand touched something that felt for all the world like somebody's cheek and lips, small and cold; and a voice whispered in her ear, ""Hush! And shush! Say nothing, for the beldam might be listening!""Coraline said nothing.She felt a cold hand touch her face, fingers running over it like the gentle beat of a moth's wings.Another voice, hesitant and so faint Coraline wondered if she were imagining it, said, ""Art thou-art thou alive?""""Yes,"" whispered Coraline.""Poor child,"" said the first voice.""Who are you?"" whispered Coraline.""Names, names, names,"" said another voice, all faraway and lost. ""The names are the first things to go, after the breath has gone, and the beating of the heart. We keep our memories longer than our names. I still keep pictures in my mind of my governess on some May morning, carrying my hoop and stick, and the morning sun behind her, and all the tulips bobbing in the breeze. But I have forgotten the name of my governess, and of the tulips too.""""I don't think tulips have names,"" said Coraline. ""They're just tulips.""""Perhaps,"" said the voice, sadly. ""But I have always thought that these tulips must have had names. They were red, and orange and red, and red and orange and yellow, like the embers in the nursery fire of a winter's evening. I remember them.""The voice sounded so sad that Coraline put out a hand to the place where the voice was coming from, and she found a cold hand, and she squeezed it tightly.Her eyes were beginning to get used to the darkness. Now Coraline saw, or imagined she saw, three shapes, each as faint and pale as the moon in the daytime sky. They were the shapes of children about her own size. The cold hand squeezed her hand back. ""Thank you,"" said the voice.""Are you a girl?"" asked Coraline. ""Or a boy?""There was a pause. ""When I was small I wore skirts and my hair was long and curled,"" it said, doubtfully. ""But now that you ask, it does seem to me that one day they took my skirts and gave me britches and cut my hair.""""'Tain't something we give a mind to,"" said the first of the voices.""A boy, perhaps, then,"" continued the one whose hand she was holding. ""I believe I was once a boy."" And it glowed a little more brightly in the darkness of the room behind the mirror.""What happened to you all?"" asked Coraline. ""How did you come here?""""She left us here,"" said one of the voices. ""She stole our hearts, and she stole our souls, and she took our lives away, and she left us here, and she forgot about us in the dark.""""You poor things,"" said Coraline. ""How long have you been here?""""So very long a time,"" said a voice.""Aye. Time beyond reckoning,"" said another voice.""I walked through the scullery door,"" said the voice of the one that thought it might be a boy, ""and I found myself back in the parlor. But she was waiting for me. She told me she was my other mamma, but I never saw my true mamma again.""""Flee!"" said the very first of the voices-another girl, Coraline fancied. ""Flee, while there's still air in your lungs and blood in your veins and warmth in your heart. Flee while you still have your mind and your soul.""""I'm not running away,"" said Coraline. ""She has my parents. I came to get them back.""""Ah, but she'll keep you here while the days turn to dust and the leaves fall and the years pass one after the next like the tick-tick-ticking of a clock.""""No,"" said Coraline. ""She won't.""There was silence then in the room behind the mirror.""Peradventure,"" said a voice in the darkness, ""if you could win your mamma and your papa back from the beldam, you could also win free our souls.""""Has she taken them?"" asked Coraline, shocked.""Aye. And hidden them.""""That is why we could not leave here, when we died. She kept us, and she fed on us, until now we've nothing left of ourselves, only snakeskins and spider husks. Find our secret hearts, young mistress.""""And what will happen to you if I do?"" asked Coraline.The voices said nothing.""And what is she going to do to me?"" she said.The pale figures pulsed faintly; she could imagine that they were nothing more than afterimages, like the glow left by a bright light in your eyes, after the lights go out.""It doth not hurt,"" whispered one faint voice.""She will take your life and all you are and all you care'st for, and she will leave you with nothing but mist and fog. She'll take your joy. And one day you'll awake and your heart and your soul will have gone. A husk you'll be, a wisp you'll be, and a thing no more than a dream on waking, or a memory of something forgotten.""""Hollow,"" whispered the third voice. ""Hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow.""""You must flee,"" sighed a voice faintly.""I don't think so,"" said Coraline. ""I tried running away, and it didn't work. She just took my parents. Can you tell me how to get out of this room?""""If we knew then we would tell you.""""Poor things,"" said Coraline to herself.She sat down. She took off her sweater and rolled it up and put it behind her head as a pillow. ""She won't keep me in the dark forever,"" said Coraline. ""She brought me here to play games. Games and challenges, the cat said. I'm not much of a challenge here in the dark."" She tried to get comfortable, twisting and bending herself to fit the cramped space behind the mirror.Her stomach rumbled. She ate her last apple, taking the tiniest bites, making it last as long as she could. When she had finished she was still hungry.Then an idea struck her, and she whispered, ""When she comes to let me out, why don't you three come with me?""""We wish that we could,"" they sighed to her, in their barely-there voices. ""But she has our hearts in her keeping. Now we belong to the dark and to the empty places. The light would shrivel us, and burn.""""Oh,"" said Coraline.She closed her eyes, which made the darkness darker, and she rested her head on the rolled-up sweater, and she went to sleep. And as she fell asleep she thought she felt a ghost kiss her cheek, tenderly, and a small voice whisper into her ear, a voice so faint it was barely there at all, a gentle wispy nothing of a voice so hushed that Coraline could almost believe she was imagining it. ""Look through the stone,"" it said to her.And then she slept.
CL_ch8	CL	Coraline	8	3240	18231	VIII.THE OTHER MOTHER looked healthier than before: there was a little blush to her cheeks, and her hair was wriggling like lazy snakes on a warm day. Her black button eyes seemed as if they had been freshly polished.She had pushed through the mirror as if she were walking through nothing more solid than water and had stared down at Coraline. Then she had opened the door with the little silver key. She picked Coraline up, just as Coraline's real mother had when Coraline was much younger, cradling the half-sleeping child as if she were a baby.The other mother carried Coraline into the kitchen and put her down very gently upon the countertop.Coraline struggled to wake herself up, conscious only for the moment of having been cuddled and loved, and wanting more of it, then realizing where she was and who she was with.""There, my sweet Coraline,"" said her other mother. ""I came and fetched you out of the cupboard. You needed to be taught a lesson, but we temper our justice with mercy here; we love the sinner and we hate the sin. Now, if you will be a good child who loves her mother, be compliant and fair-spoken, you and I shall understand each other perfectly and we shall love each other perfectly as well.""Coraline scratched the sleep grit from her eyes.""There were other children in there,"" she said. ""Old ones, from a long time ago.""""Were there?"" said the other mother. She was bustling between the pans and the fridge, bringing out eggs and cheeses, butter and a slab of sliced pink bacon.""Yes,"" said Coraline. ""There were. I think you're planning to turn me into one of them. A dead shell.""Her other mother smiled gently. With one hand she cracked the eggs into a bowl; with the other she whisked them and whirled them. Then she dropped a pat of butter into a frying pan, where it hissed and fizzled and spun as she sliced thin slices of cheese. She poured the melted butter and the cheese into the egg-mixture, and whisked it some more.""Now, I think you're being silly, dear,"" said the other mother. ""I love you. I will always love you. Nobody sensible believes in ghosts anyway-that's because they're all such liars. Smell the lovely breakfast I'm making for you."" She poured the yellow mixture into the pan. ""Cheese omelette. Your favorite.""Coraline's mouth watered. ""You like games,"" she said. ""That's what I've been told.""The other mother's black eyes flashed. ""Everybody likes games,"" was all she said.""Yes,"" said Coraline. She climbed down from the counter and sat at the table.The bacon was sizzling and spitting under the grill. It smelled wonderful.""Wouldn't you be happier if you won me, fair and square?"" asked Coraline.""Possibly,"" said the other mother. She had a show of unconcernedness, but her fingers twitched and drummed and she licked her lips with her scarlet tongue. ""What exactly are you offering?""""Me,"" said Coraline, and she gripped her knees under the table, to stop them from shaking. ""If I lose I'll stay here with you forever and I'll let you love me. I'll be a most dutiful daughter. I'll eat your food and play Happy Families. And I'll let you sew your buttons into my eyes.""Her other mother stared at her, black buttons unblinking. ""That sounds very fine,"" she said. ""And if you do not lose?""""Then you let me go. You let everyone go-my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here.""The other mother took the bacon from under the grill and put it on a plate. Then she slipped the cheese omelette from the pan onto the plate, flipping it as she did so, letting it fold itself into a perfect omelette shape.She placed the breakfast plate in front of Coraline, along with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a mug of frothy hot chocolate.""Yes,"" she said. ""I think I like this game. But what kind of game shall it be? A riddle game? A test of knowledge or of skill?""An exploring game,"" suggested Coraline. ""A finding-things game.""""And what is it you think you should be finding in this hide-and-go-seek game, Coraline Jones?""Coraline hesitated. Then, ""My parents,"" said Coraline. ""And the souls of the children behind the mirror.""The other mother smiled at this, triumphantly, and Coraline wondered if she had made the right choice. Still, it was too late to change her mind now.""A deal,"" said the other mother. ""Now eat up your breakfast, my sweet. Don't worry-it won't hurt you.""Coraline stared at the breakfast, hating herself for giving in so easily, but she was starving.""How do I know you'll keep your word?"" asked Coraline.""I swear it,"" said the other mother. ""I swear it on my own mother's grave.""""Does she have a grave?"" asked Coraline.""Oh yes,"" said the other mother. ""I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back.""""Swear on something else. So I can trust you to keep your word.""""My right hand,"" said the other mother, holding it up. She waggled the long fingers slowly, displaying the clawlike nails. ""I swear on that.""Coraline shrugged. ""Okay,"" she said. ""It's a deal."" She ate the breakfast, trying not to wolf it down. She was hungrier than she had thought.As she ate, her other mother stared at her. It was hard to read expressions into those black button eyes, but Coraline thought that her other mother looked hungry, too.She drank the orange juice, but even though she knew she would like it she could not bring herself to taste the hot chocolate.""Where should I start looking?"" asked Coraline.""Where you wish,"" said her other mother, as if she did not care at all.Coraline looked at her, and Coraline thought hard. There was no point, she decided, in exploring the garden and the grounds: they didn't exist; they weren't real. There was no abandoned tennis court in the other mother's world, no bottomless well. All that was real was the house itself.She looked around the kitchen. She opened the oven, peered into the freezer, poked into the salad compartment of the fridge. The other mother followed her about, looking at Coraline with a smirk always hovering at the edge of her lips.""How big are souls anyway?"" asked Coraline.The other mother sat down at the kitchen table and leaned back against the wall, saying nothing. She picked at her teeth with a long crimson-varnished fingernail, then she tapped the finger, gently, tap-tap-tap against the polished black surface of her black button eyes.""Fine,"" said Coraline. ""Don't tell me. I don't care. It doesn't matter if you help me or not. Everyone knows that a soul is the same size as a beach ball.""She was hoping the other mother would say something like ""Nonsense, they're the size of ripe onions-or suitcases-or grandfather clocks,"" but the other mother simply smiled, and the tap-tap-tapping of her fingernail against her eye was as steady and relentless as the drip of water droplets from the faucet into the sink. And then, Coraline realized, it was simply the noise of the water, and she was alone in the room.Coraline shivered. She preferred the other mother to have a location: if she were nowhere, then she could be anywhere. And, after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something you cannot see. She put her hands into her pockets and her fingers closed around the reassuring shape of the stone with the hole in it. She pulled it out of her pocket, held it in front of her as if she were holding a gun, and walked out into the hall.There was no sound but the tap-tap of the water dripping into the metal sink.She glanced at the mirror at the end of the hall. For a moment it clouded over, and it seemed to her that faces swam in the glass, indistinct and shapeless, and then the faces were gone, and there was nothing in the mirror but a girl who was small for her age holding something that glowed gently, like a green coal.Coraline looked down at her hand, surprised: it was just a stone with a hole in it, a nondescript brown pebble. Then she looked back into the mirror where the stone glimmered like an emerald. A trail of green fire blew from the pebble in the mirror and drifted toward Coraline's bedroom.""Hmm,"" said Coraline.She walked into the bedroom. The toys fluttered excitedly as she walked in, as if they were pleased to see her, and a little tank rolled out of the toy box to greet her, its tread rolling over several other toys. It fell from the toy box onto the floor, tipping as it fell, and it lay on the carpet like a beetle on its back, grumbling and grinding its treads before Coraline picked it up and turned it over. The tank fled under the bed in embarrassment.Coraline looked around the room.She looked in the cupboards, and the drawers. Then she picked up one end of the toy box and tipped all the toys in it out onto the carpet, where they grumbled and stretched and wiggled awkwardly free of each other. A gray marble rolled across the floor and clicked against the wall. None of the toys looked particularly soul-like, she thought. She picked up and examined a silver charm bracelet from which hung tiny animal charms that chased each other around the perimeter of the bracelet, the fox never catching the rabbit, the bear never gaining on the fox.Coraline opened her hand and looked at the stone with the hole in it, hoping for a clue but not finding one. Most of the toys that had been in the toy box had now crawled away to hide under the bed, and the few toys that were left (a green plastic soldier, the glass marble, a vivid pink yo-yo, and such) were the kind of things you find in the bottoms of toy boxes in the real world: forgotten objects, abandoned and unloved.She was about to leave and look elsewhere. And then she remembered a voice in the darkness, a gentle whispering voice, and what it had told her to do. She raised the stone with a hole in it and held it in front of her right eye. She closed her left eye and looked at the room through the hole in the stone.Through the stone, the world was gray and colorless, like a pencil drawing. Everything in it was gray-no, not quite everything: something glinted on the floor, something the color of an ember in a nursery fireplace, the color of a scarlet-and-orange tulip nodding in the May sun. Coraline reached out her left hand, scared that if she took her eye off it it would vanish, and she fumbled for the burning thing.Her fingers closed about something smooth and cool. She snatched it up, and then lowered the stone with a hole in it from her eye and looked down. The gray glass marble from the bottom of the toy box sat, dully, in the pink palm of her hand. She raised the stone to her eye once more and looked through it at the marble. Once again the marble burned and flickered with a red fire.A voice whispered in her mind, ""Indeed, lady, it comes to me that I certainly was a boy, now I do think on it. Oh, but you must hurry. There are two of us still to find, and the beldam is already angry with you for uncovering me.""If I'm going to do this, thought Coraline, I'm not going to do it in her clothes. She changed back into her pajamas and her dressing gown and her slippers, leaving the gray sweater and the black jeans neatly folded up on the bed, the orange boots on the floor by the toy box.She put the marble into her dressing-gown pocket and walked out into the hall.Something stung her face and hands like sand blowing on a beach on a windy day. She covered her eyes and pushed forward.The sand stings got worse, and it got harder and harder to walk, as if she were pushing into the wind on a particularly blustery day. It was a vicious wind, and a cold one.She took a step backwards, the way she had come.""Oh, keep going,"" whispered a ghost voice in her ear, ""for the beldam is angry.""She stepped forward in the hallway, into another gust of wind, which stung her cheeks and face with invisible sand, sharp as needles, sharp as glass.""Play fair,"" shouted Coraline into the wind.There was no reply, but the wind whipped about her one more time, petulantly, and then it dropped away, and was gone. As she passed the kitchen Coraline could hear, in the sudden silence, the drip-drip of the water from the leaking tap or perhaps the other mother's long fingernails tapping impatiently against the table. Coraline resisted the urge to look.In a couple of strides she reached the front door, and she walked outside.Coraline went down the steps and around the house until she reached the other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's flat. The lamps around the door were flickering on and off almost randomly now, spelling out no words that Coraline could understand. The door was closed. She was afraid it was locked, and she pushed on it with all her strength. First it stuck, then suddenly it gave, and, with a jerk, Coraline stumbled into the dark room beyond.Coraline closed one hand around the stone with the hole in it and walked forward into blackness. She expected to find a curtained anteroom, but there was nothing there. The room was dark. The theater was empty. She moved ahead cautiously. Something rustled above her. She looked up into a deeper darkness, and as she did so her feet knocked against something. She reached down, picked up a flashlight, and clicked it on, sweeping the beam around the room.The theater was derelict and abandoned. Chairs were broken on the floor, and old, dusty spiderwebs draped the walls and hung from the rotten wood and the decomposing velvet hangings.Something rustled once again. Coraline directed her light beam upward, toward the ceiling. There were things up there, hairless, jellyish. She thought they might once have had faces, might even once have been dogs; but no dogs had wings like bats or could hang, like spiders, like bats, upside down.The light startled the creatures, and one of them took to the air, its wings whirring heavily through the dust. Coraline ducked as it swooped close to her. It came to rest on a far wall, and it began to clamber, upside down, back to the nest of the dog-bats upon the ceiling.Coraline raised the stone to her eye and she scanned the room through it, looking for something that glowed or glinted, a telltale sign that somewhere in this room was another hidden soul. She ran the beam of the flashlight about the room as she searched, the thick dust in the air making the light beam seem almost solid.There was something up on the back wall behind the ruined stage. It was grayish white, twice the size of Coraline herself, and it was stuck to the back wall like a slug. Coraline took a deep breath. ""I'm not afraid,"" she told herself. ""I'm not."" She did not believe herself, but she scrambled up onto the old stage, fingers sinking into the rotting wood as she pulled herself up.As she got closer to the thing on the wall, she saw that it was some kind of a sac, like a spider's egg case. It twitched in the light beam. Inside the sac was something that looked like a person, but a person with two heads, with twice as many arms and legs as it should have.The creature in the sac seemed horribly unformed and unfinished, as if two plasticine people had been warmed and rolled together, squashed and pressed into one thing.Coraline hesitated. She did not want to approach the thing. The dog-bats dropped, one by one, from the ceiling and began to circle the room, coming close to her but never touching her.Perhaps there are no souls hidden in here, she thought. Perhaps I can just leave and go somewhere else. She took a last look through the hole in the stone: the abandoned theater was still a bleak gray, but now there was a brown glow, as rich and bright as polished cherrywood, coming from inside the sac. Whatever was glowing was being held in one of the hands of the thing on the wall.Coraline walked slowly across the damp stage, trying to make as little noise as she could, afraid that, if she disturbed the thing in the sac, it would open its eyes, and see her, and then...But there was nothing that she could think of as scary as having it look at her. Her heart pounded in her chest. She took another step forward.She had never been so scared, but still she walked forward until she reached the sac. Then she pushed her hand into the sticky, clinging whiteness of the stuff on the wall. It crackled softly, like a tiny fire, as she pushed, and it clung to her skin and clothes like a spiderweb clings, like white cotton candy. She pushed her hand into it, and she reached upward until she touched a cold hand, which was, she could feel, closed around another glass marble. The creature's skin felt slippery, as if it had been covered in jelly. Coraline tugged at the marble.At first nothing happened: it was held tight in the creature's grasp. Then, one by one, the fingers loosened their grip, and the marble slipped into her hand. She pulled her arm back through the sticky webbing, relieved that the thing's eyes had not opened. She shone the light on its faces: they resembled, she decided, the younger versions of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, but twisted and squeezed together, like two lumps of wax that had melted and melded together into one ghastly thing.Without warning, one of the creature's hands made a grab for Coraline's arm. Its fingernails scraped her skin, but it was too slippery to grip, and Coraline pulled away successfully. And then the eyes opened, four black buttons glinting and staring down at her, and two voices that sounded like no voice that Coraline had ever heard began to speak to her. One of them wailed and whispered, the other buzzed like a fat and angry bluebottle at a windowpane, but the voices said, as one person, ""Thief! Give it back! Stop! Thief!""The air became alive with dog-bats. Coraline began to back away. She realized then that, terrifying though the thing on the wall that had once been the other Misses Spink and Forcible was, it was attached to the wall by its web, encased in its cocoon. It could not follow her.The dog-bats flapped and fluttered about her, but they did nothing to hurt Coraline. She climbed down from the stage, shone the flashlight about the old theater looking for the way out.""Flee, Miss,"" wailed a girl's voice in her head. ""Flee, now. You have two of us. Flee this place while your blood still flows.""Coraline dropped the marble into her pocket beside the other. She spotted the door, ran to it, and pulled on it until it opened.
CL_ch9	CL	Coraline	9	2176	12034	IX.OUTSIDE, THE WORLD HAD become a formless, swirling mist with no shapes or shadows behind it, while the house itself seemed to have twisted and stretched. It seemed to Coraline that it was crouching, and staring down at her, as if it were not really a house but only the idea of a house-and the person who had had the idea, she was certain, was not a good person. There was sticky web stuff clinging to her arm, and she wiped it off as best she could. The gray windows of the house slanted at strange angles.The other mother was waiting for her, standing on the grass with her arms folded. Her black button eyes were expressionless, but her lips were pressed tightly together in a cold fury.When she saw Coraline she reached out one long white hand, and she crooked a finger. Coraline walked toward her. The other mother said nothing.""I got two,"" said Coraline. ""One soul still to go.""The expression on the other mother's face did not change. She might not have heard what Coraline said.""Well, I just thought you'd want to know,"" said Coraline.""Thank you, Coraline,"" said the other mother coldly, and her voice did not just come from her mouth. It came from the mist, and the fog, and the house, and the sky. She said, ""You know that I love you.""And, despite herself, Coraline nodded. It was true: the other mother loved her. But she loved Coraline as a miser loves money, or a dragon loves its gold. In the other mother's button eyes, Coraline knew that she was a possession, nothing more. A tolerated pet, whose behavior was no longer amusing.""I don't want your love,"" said Coraline. ""I don't want anything from you.""""Not even a helping hand?"" asked the other mother. ""You have been doing so well, after all. I thought you might want a little hint, to help you with the rest of your treasure hunt.""""I'm doing fine on my own,"" said Coraline.""Yes,"" said the other mother. ""But if you wanted to get into the flat in the front-the empty one-to look around, you would find the door locked, and then where would you be?""""Oh,"" Coraline pondered this, for a moment. Then she said, ""Is there a key?""The other mother stood there in the paper-gray fog of the flattening world. Her black hair drifted about her head, as if it had a mind and a purpose all of its own. She coughed suddenly in the back of her throat, and then she opened her mouth.The other mother reached up her hand and removed a small, brass front-door key from her tongue.""Here,"" she said. ""You'll need this to get in.""She tossed the key, casually, toward Coraline, who caught it, one-handed, before she could think about whether she wanted it or not. The key was still slightly damp.A chill wind blew about them, and Coraline shivered and looked away. When she looked back she was alone.Uncertainly, she walked around to the front of the house and stood in front of the door to the empty flat. Like all the doors, it was painted bright green.""She does not mean you well,"" whispered a ghost voice in her ear. ""We do not believe that she would help you. It must be a trick.""Coraline said, ""Yes, you're right, I expect."" Then she put the key in the lock and turned it.Silently, the door swung open, and silently Coraline walked inside.The flat had walls the color of old milk. The wooden boards of the floor were uncarpeted and dusty with the marks and patterns of old carpets and rugs on them.There was no furniture in there, only places where furniture had once been. Nothing decorated the walls; there were discolored rectangles on the walls to show where paintings or photographs had once hung. It was so silent that Coraline imagined that she could hear the motes of dust drifting through the air.She found herself to be quite worried that something would jump out at her, so she began to whistle. She thought it might make it harder for things to jump out at her if she was whistling.First she walked through the empty kitchen. Then she walked through an empty bathroom, containing only a cast-iron bath, and, in the bath, a dead spider the size of a small cat. The last room she looked at had, she supposed, once been a bedroom; she could imagine that the rectangular dust shadow on the floorboards had once been a bed. Then she saw something, and smiled, grimly. Set into the floorboards was a large metal ring. Coraline knelt and took the cold ring in her hands, and she tugged upward as hard as she could.Terribly slowly, stiffly, heavily, a hinged square of floor lifted: it was a trapdoor. It lifted, and through the opening Coraline could see only darkness. She reached down, and her hand found a cold switch. She flicked it without much hope that it would work, but somewhere below her a bulb lit, and a thin yellow light came up from the hole in the floor. She could see steps, heading down, but nothing else.Coraline put her hand into her pocket and took out the stone with the hole in it. She looked through it at the cellar but saw nothing. She put the stone back into her pocket.Up through the hole came the smell of damp clay, and something else, an acrid tang like sour vinegar.Coraline let herself down into the hole, looking nervously at the trapdoor. It was so heavy that if it fell she was sure she would be trapped down in the darkness forever. She put up a hand and touched it, but it stayed in position. And then she turned toward the darkness below, and she walked down the steps. Set into the wall at the bottom of the steps was another light switch, metal and rusting. She pushed it until it clicked down, and a naked bulb hanging from a wire from the low ceiling came on. It did not give up enough light even for Coraline to make out the things that had been painted onto the flaking cellar walls. The paintings seemed crude. There were eyes, she could see that, and things that might have been grapes. And other things, below them. Coraline could not be sure that they were paintings of people.There was a pile of rubbish in one corner of the room: cardboard boxes filled with mildewed papers and decaying curtains in a heap beside them.Coraline's slippers crunched across the cement floor. The bad smell was worse, now. She was ready to turn and leave, when she saw the foot sticking out from beneath the pile of curtains.She took a deep breath (the smells of sour wine and moldy bread filled her head) and she pulled away the damp cloth, to reveal something more or less the size and shape of a person.In that dim light, it took her several seconds to recognize it for what it was: the thing was pale and swollen like a grub, with thin, sticklike arms and feet. It had almost no features on its face, which had puffed and swollen like risen bread dough.The thing had two large black buttons where its eyes should have been.Coraline made a noise, a sound of revulsion and horror, and, as if it had heard her and awakened, the thing began to sit up. Coraline stood there, frozen. The thing turned its head until both its black button eyes were pointed straight at her. A mouth opened in the mouthless face, strands of pale stuff sticking to the lips, and a voice that no longer even faintly resembled her father's whispered, ""Coraline.""""Well,"" said Coraline to the thing that had once been her other father, ""at least you didn't jump out at me.""The creature's twiglike hands moved to its face and pushed the pale clay about, making something like a nose. It said nothing.""I'm looking for my parents,"" said Coraline. ""Or a stolen soul from one of the other children. Are they down here?""""There is nothing down here,"" said the pale thing indistinctly. ""Nothing but dust and damp and forgetting."" The thing was white, and huge, and swollen. Monstrous, thought Coraline, but also miserable. She raised the stone with the hole in it to her eye and looked through it. Nothing. The pale thing was telling her the truth.""Poor thing,"" she said. ""I bet she made you come down here as a punishment for telling me too much.""The thing hesitated, then it nodded. Coraline wondered how she could ever have imagined that this grublike thing resembled her father.""I'm so sorry,"" she said.""She's not best pleased,"" said the thing that was once the other father. ""Not best pleased at all. You've put her quite out of sorts. And when she gets out of sorts, she takes it out on everybody else. It's her way.""Coraline patted its hairless head. Its skin was tacky, like warm bread dough. ""Poor thing,"" she said. ""You're just a thing she made and then threw away.""The thing nodded vigorously; as it nodded, the left button eye fell off and clattered onto the concrete floor. The thing looked around vacantly with its one eye, as if it had lost her. Finally it saw her, and, as if making a great effort, it opened its mouth once more and said in a wet, urgent voice, ""Run, child. Leave this place. She wants me to hurt you, to keep you here forever, so that you can never finish the game and she will win. She is pushing me so hard to hurt you. I cannot fight her.""""You can,"" said Coraline. ""Be brave.""She looked around: the thing that had once been the other father was between her and the steps up and out of the cellar. She started edging along the wall, heading toward the steps. The thing twisted bonelessly until its one eye was again facing her. It seemed to be getting bigger, now, and more awake. ""Alas,"" it said, ""I cannot.""And it lunged across the cellar toward her then, its toothless mouth opened wide.Coraline had a single heartbeat in which to react. She could only think of two things to do. Either she could scream and try to run away, and be chased around a badly lit cellar by the huge grub thing, be chased until it caught her. Or she could do something else.So she did something else.As the thing reached her, Coraline put out her hand and closed it around the thing's remaining button eye, and she tugged as hard as she knew how.For a moment nothing happened. Then the button came away and flew from her hand, clicking against the walls before it fell to the cellar floor.The thing froze in place. It threw its pale head back blindly, and opened its mouth horribly wide, and it roared its anger and frustration. Then, all in a rush, the thing swept toward the place where Coraline had been standing.But Coraline was not standing there any longer. She was already tiptoeing, as quietly as she could, up the steps that would take her away from the dim cellar with the crude paintings on the walls. She could not take her eyes from the floor beneath her, though, across which the pale thing flopped and writhed, hunting for her. Then, as if it was being told what to do, the creature stopped moving, and its blind head tipped to one side.It's listening for me, thought Coraline. I must be extra quiet. She took another step up, and her foot slipped on the step, and the thing heard her.Its head tipped toward her. For a moment it swayed and seemed to be gathering its wits. Then, fast as a serpent, it slithered for the steps and began to flow up them, toward her. Coraline turned and ran, wildly, up the last half dozen steps, and she pushed herself up and onto the floor of the dusty bedroom. Without pausing, she pulled the heavy trapdoor toward her, and let go of it. It crashed down with a thump just as something large banged against it. The trapdoor shook and rattled in the floor, but it stayed where it was.Coraline took a deep breath. If there had been any furniture in that flat, even a chair, she would have pulled it onto the trapdoor, but there was nothing.She walked out of that flat as fast as she could, without actually ever running, and she locked the front door behind her. She left the door key under the mat. Then she walked down onto the drive.She had half expected that the other mother would be standing there waiting for Coraline to come out, but the world was silent and empty.Coraline wanted to go home.She hugged herself, and told herself that she was brave, and she almost believed herself, and then she walked around to the side of the house, in the gray mist that wasn't a mist, and she made for the stairs, to go up.
CL_ch10	CL	Coraline	10	2282	12509	X.CORALINE WALKED UP THE stairs outside the building to the topmost flat, where, in her world, the crazy old man upstairs lived. She had gone up there once with her real mother, when her mother was collecting for charity. They had stood in the open doorway, waiting for the crazy old man with the big mustache to find the envelope that Coraline's mother had left, and the flat had smelled of strange foods and pipe tobacco and odd, sharp, cheesy-smelling things Coraline could not name. She had not wanted to go any farther inside than that.""I'm an explorer,"" said Coraline out loud, but her words sounded muffled and dead on the misty air. She had made it out of the cellar, hadn't she?And she had. But if there was one thing that Coraline was certain of, it was that this flat would be worse.She reached the top of the house. The topmost flat had once been the attic of the house, but that was long ago.She knocked on the green-painted door. It swung open, and she walked in.We have eyes and we have nervesesWe have tails we have teethYou'll all get what you deservesesWhen we rise from underneath.whispered a dozen or more tiny voices, in that dark flat with the roof so low where it met the walls that Coraline could almost reach up and touch it.Red eyes stared at her. Little pink feet scurried away as she came close. Darker shadows slipped through the shadows at the edges of things.It smelled much worse in here than in the real crazy old man upstairs's flat. That smelled of food (unpleasant food, to Coraline's mind, but she knew that was a matter of taste: she did not like spices, herbs, or exotic things). This place smelled as if all the exotic foods in the world had been left out to go rotten.""Little girl,"" said a rustling voice in a far room.""Yes,"" said Coraline. I'm not frightened, she told herself, and as she thought it she knew that it was true. There was nothing here that frightened her. These things-even the thing in the cellar-were illusions, things made by the other mother in a ghastly parody of the real people and real things on the other end of the corridor. She could not truly make anything, decided Coraline. She could only twist and copy and distort things that already existed.And then Coraline found herself wondering why the other mother would have placed a snowglobe on the drawing-room mantelpiece; for the mantelpiece, in Coraline's world, was quite bare.As soon as she had asked herself the question, she realized that there was actually an answer.Then the voice came again, and her train of thought was interrupted.""Come here, little girl. I know what you want, little girl."" It was a rustling voice, scratchy and dry. It made Coraline think of some kind of enormous dead insect. Which was silly, she knew. How could a dead thing, especially a dead insect, have a voice?She walked through several rooms with low, slanting ceilings until she came to the final room. It was a bedroom, and the other crazy old man upstairs sat at the far end of the room, in the near darkness, bundled up in his coat and hat. As Coraline entered he began to talk. ""Nothing's changed, little girl,"" he said, his voice sounding like the noise dry leaves make as they rustle across a pavement. ""And what if you do everything you swore you would? What then? Nothing's changed. You'll go home. You'll be bored. You'll be ignored. No one will listen to you, not really listen to you. You're too clever and too quiet for them to understand. They don't even get your name right.""Stay here with us,"" said the voice from the figure at the end of the room. ""We will listen to you and play with you and laugh with you. Your other mother will build whole worlds for you to explore, and tear them down every night when you are done. Every day will be better and brighter than the one that went before. Remember the toy box? How much better would a world be built just like that, and all for you?""""And will there be gray, wet days where I just don't know what to do and there's nothing to read or to watch and nowhere to go and the day drags on forever?"" asked Coraline.From the shadows, the man said, ""Never.""""And will there be awful meals, with food made from recipes, with garlic and tarragon and broad beans in?"" asked Coraline.""Every meal will be a thing of joy,"" whispered the voice from under the old man's hat. ""Nothing will pass your lips that does not entirely delight you.""""And could I have Day-Glo green gloves to wear, and yellow Wellington boots in the shape of frogs?"" asked Coraline.""Frogs, ducks, rhinos, octopuses-whatever you desire. The world will be built new for you every morning. If you stay here, you can have whatever you want.""Coraline sighed. ""You really don't understand, do you?"" she said. ""I don't want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted? Just like that, and it didn't mean anything. What then?""""I don't understand,"" said the whispery voice.""Of course you don't understand,"" she said, raising the stone with the hole in it to her eye. ""You're just a bad copy she made of the crazy old man upstairs."" ""Not even that anymore,"" said the dead, whispery voice. There was a glow coming from the raincoat of the man, at about chest height. Through the hole in the stone the glow twinkled and shone blue-white as any star. She wished she had a stick or something to poke him with: she had no wish to get any closer to the shadowy man at the end of the room.Coraline took a step closer to the man, and he fell apart. Black rats leapt from the sleeves and from under the coat and hat, a score or more of them, red eyes shining in the dark. They chittered and they fled. The coat fluttered and fell heavily to the floor. The hat rolled into one corner of the room.Coraline reached out one hand and pulled the coat open. It was empty, although it was greasy to the touch. There was no sign of the final glass marble in it. She scanned the room, squinting through the hole in the stone, and caught sight of something that twinkled and burned like a star at floor level by the doorway. It was being carried in the forepaws of the largest black rat. As she looked, it slipped away.The other rats watched her from the corners of the rooms as she ran after it.Now, rats can run faster than people, especially over short distances. But a large black rat holding a marble in its two front paws is no match for a determined girl (even if she is small for her age) moving at a run. Smaller black rats ran back and forth across her path, trying to distract her, but she ignored them all, keeping her eyes fixed on the one with the marble, who was heading straight out of the flat, toward the front door.They reached the steps on the outside of the building.Coraline had time to observe that the house itself was continuing to change, becoming less distinct and flattening out, even as she raced down the stairs. It reminded her of a photograph of a house, now, not the thing itself. Then she was simply racing pell-mell down the steps in pursuit of the rat, with no room in her mind for anything else, certain she was gaining on it. She was running fast-too fast, she discovered, as she came to the bottom of one flight of stairs, and her foot skidded and twisted and she went crashing onto the concrete landing.Her left knee was scraped and skinned, and the palm of one hand she had thrown out to stop herself was a mess of scraped skin and grit. It hurt a little, and it would, she knew, soon hurt much more. She picked the grit out of her palm and climbed to her feet and, as fast as she could, knowing that she had lost and it was already too late, she went down to the final landing at the ground level.She looked around for the rat, but it was gone, and the marble with it.Her hand stung where the skin had been scraped, and there was blood trickling down her ripped pajama leg from her knee. It was as bad as the summer that her mother had taken the training wheels off Coraline's bicycle; but then, back then, in with all the cuts and scrapes (her knees had had scabs on top of scabs) she had had a feeling of achievement. She was learning something, doing something she had not known how to do. Now she felt nothing but cold loss. She had failed the ghost children. She had failed her parents. She had failed herself, failed everything.She closed her eyes and wished that the earth would swallow her up.There was a cough.She opened her eyes and saw the rat. It was lying on the brick path at the bottom of the stairs with a surprised look on its face-which was now several inches away from the rest of it. Its whiskers were stiff, its eyes were wide open, its teeth visible and yellow and sharp. A collar of wet blood glistened at its neck.Beside the decapitated rat, a smug expression on its face, was the black cat. It rested one paw on the gray glass marble.""I think I once mentioned,"" said the cat, ""that I don't like rats at the best of times. It looked like you needed this one, however. I hope you don't mind my getting involved.""""I think,"" said Coraline, trying to catch her breath, ""I think you may-have said-something of the sort.""The cat lifted its paw from the marble, which rolled toward Coraline. She picked it up. In her mind a final voice whispered to her, urgently.""She has lied to you. She will never give you up, now she has you. She will no more give any of us up than change her nature."" The hairs on the back of Coraline's neck prickled, and Coraline knew that the girl's voice told the truth. She put the marble in her dressing-gown pocket with the others.She had all three marbles, now.All she needed to do was to find her parents.And, Coraline realized with surprise, that bit was easy. She knew exactly where her parents were. If she had stopped to think, she might have known where they were all along. The other mother could not create. She could only transform, and twist, and change.The mantelpiece in the drawing room back home was quite empty. But knowing that, she knew something else as well.""The other mother. She plans to break her promise. She won't let us go,"" said Coraline.""I wouldn't put it past her,"" admitted the cat. ""Like I said, there's no guarantee she'll play fair."" And then he raised his head. ""Hullo...did you see that?""""What?""""Look behind you,"" said the cat.The house had flattened out even more. It no longer looked like a photograph-more like a drawing, a crude, charcoal scribble of a house drawn on gray paper.""Whatever's happening,"" said Coraline, ""thank you for helping with the rat. I suppose I'm almost there, aren't I? So you go off into the mist or wherever you go, and I'll, well, I hope I get to see you at home. If she lets me go home.""The cat's fur was on end, and its tail was bristling like a chimney sweep's brush.""What's wrong?"" asked Coraline.""They've gone,"" said the cat. ""They aren't there anymore. The ways in and out of this place. They just went flat.""""Is that bad?""The cat lowered its tail, swishing it from side to side angrily. It made a low growling noise in the back of its throat. It walked in a circle, until it was facing away from Coraline, and then it began to walk backwards, stiffly, one step at a time, until it was pushing up against Coraline's leg. She put down a hand to stroke it, and could feel how hard its heart was beating. It was trembling like a dead leaf in a storm.""You'll be fine,"" said Coraline. ""Everything's going to be fine. I'll take you home.""The cat said nothing.""Come on, cat,"" said Coraline. She took a step back toward the steps, but the cat stayed where it was, looking miserable and, oddly, much smaller.""If the only way out is past her,"" said Coraline, ""then that's the way we're going to go."" She went back to the cat, bent down, and picked it up. The cat did not resist. It simply trembled. She supported its bottom with one hand, rested its front legs on her shoulders. The cat was heavy but not too heavy to carry. It licked at the palm of her hand, where the blood from the scrape was welling up.Coraline walked up the stairs one step at a time, heading back to her own flat. She was aware of the marbles clicking in her pocket, aware of the stone with a hole in it, aware of the cat pressing itself against her.She got to her front door-now just a small child's scrawl of a door-and she pushed her hand against it, half expecting that her hand would rip through it, revealing nothing behind it but blackness and a scattering of stars.But the door swung open, and Coraline went through.
CL_ch11	CL	Coraline	11	2094	11804	XI.ONCE INSIDE, IN HER FLAT, or rather, in the flat that was not hers, Coraline was pleased to see that it had not transformed into the empty drawing that the rest of the house seemed to have become. It had depth, and shadows, and someone who stood in the shadows waiting for Coraline to return.""So you're back,"" said the other mother. She did not sound pleased. ""And you brought vermin with you.""""No,"" said Coraline. ""I brought a friend,"" She could feel the cat stiffening under her hands, as if it were anxious to be away. Coraline wanted to hold on to it like a teddy bear, for reassurance, but she knew that cats hate to be squeezed, and she suspected that frightened cats were liable to bite and scratch if provoked in any way, even if they were on your side.""You know I love you,"" said the other mother flatly.""You have a very funny way of showing it,"" said Coraline. She walked down the hallway, then turned into the drawing room, steady step by steady step, pretending that she could not feel the other mother's blank black eyes on her back. Her grandmother's formal furniture was still there, and the painting on the wall of the strange fruit (but now the fruit in the painting had been eaten, and all that remained in the bowl was the browning core of an apple, several plum and peach stones, and the stem of what had formerly been a bunch of grapes). The lion-pawed table raked the carpet with its clawed wooden feet, as if it were impatient for something. At the end of the room, in the corner, stood the wooden door, which had once, in another place, opened onto a plain brick wall. Coraline tried not to stare at it. The window showed nothing but mist.This was it, Coraline knew. The moment of truth. The unraveling time.The other mother had followed her in. Now she stood in the center of the room, between Coraline and the mantelpiece, and looked down at Coraline with black button eyes. It was funny, Coraline thought. The other mother did not look anything at all like her own mother. She wondered how she had ever been deceived into imagining a resemblance. The other mother was huge-her head almost brushed the ceiling-and very pale, the color of a spider's belly. Her hair writhed and twined about her head, and her teeth were sharp as knives... .""Well?"" said the other mother sharply. ""Where are they?""Coraline leaned against an armchair, adjusted the cat with her left hand, put her right hand into her pocket, and pulled out the three glass marbles. They were a frosted gray, and they clinked together in the palm of her hand. The other mother reached her white fingers for them, but Coraline slipped them back into her pocket. She knew it was true, then. The other mother had no intention of letting her go or of keeping her word. It had been an entertainment, and nothing more. ""Hold on,"" she said. ""We aren't finished yet, are we?""The other mother looked daggers, but she smiled sweetly. ""No,"" she said. ""I suppose not. After all, you still need to find your parents, don't you?""""Yes,"" said Coraline. I must not look at the mantelpiece, she thought. I must not even think about it.""Well?"" said the other mother. ""Produce them. Would you like to look in the cellar again? I have some other interesting things hidden down there, you know.""""No,"" said Coraline. ""I know where my parents are."" The cat was heavy in her arms. She moved it forward, unhooking its claws from her shoulder as she did so.""Where?""""It stands to reason,"" said Coraline. ""I've looked everywhere you'd hide them. They aren't in the house.""The other mother stood very still, giving nothing away, lips tightly closed. She might have been a wax statue. Even her hair had stopped moving.""So,"" Coraline continued, both hands wrapped firmly around the black cat. ""I know where they have to be. You've hidden them in the passageway between the houses, haven't you? They are behind that door."" She nodded her head toward the door in the corner.The other mother remained statue still, but a hint of a smile crept back onto her face. ""Oh, they are, are they?""""Why don't you open it?"" said Coraline. ""They'll be there, all right.""It was her only way home, she knew. But it all depended on the other mother's needing to gloat, needing not only to win but to show that she had won.The other mother reached her hand slowly into her apron pocket and produced the black iron key. The cat stirred uncomfortably in Coraline's arms, as if it wanted to get down. Just stay there for a few moments longer, she thought at it, wondering if it could hear her. I'll get us both home. I said I would. I promise. She felt the cat relax ever so slightly in her arms.The other mother walked over to the door and pushed the key into the lock.She turned the key.Coraline heard the mechanism clunk heavily. She was already starting, as quietly as she could, step by step, to back away toward the mantelpiece.The other mother pushed down on the door handle and pulled open the door, revealing a corridor behind it, dark and empty. ""There,"" she said, waving her hands at the corridor. The expression of delight on her face was a very bad thing to see. ""You're wrong! You don't know where your parents are, do you? They aren't there."" She turned and looked at Coraline. ""Now,"" she said, ""you're going to stay here for ever and always.""""No,"" said Coraline. ""I'm not."" And, hard as she could, she threw the black cat toward the other mother. It yowled and landed on the other mother's head, claws flailing, teeth bared, fierce and angry. Fur on end, it looked half again as big as it was in real life.Without waiting to see what would happen, Coraline reached up to the mantlepiece and closed her hand around the snow globe, pushing it deep into the pocket of her dressing gown.The cat made a deep, ululating yowl and sank its teeth into the other mother's cheek. She was flailing at it. Blood ran from the cuts on her white face-not red blood but a deep, tarry black stuff. Coraline ran for the door.She pulled the key out of the lock.""Leave her! Come on!"" she shouted to the cat. It hissed, and swiped its scalpel-sharp claws at the other mother's face in one wild rake which left black ooze trickling from several gashes on the other mother's nose. Then it sprang down toward Coraline. ""Quickly!"" she said. The cat ran toward her, and they both stepped into the dark corridor.It was colder in the corridor, like stepping down into a cellar on a warm day. The cat hesitated for a moment; then, seeing the other mother was coming toward them, it ran to Coraline and stopped by her legs.Coraline began to pull the door closed.It was heavier than she imagined a door could be, and pulling it closed was like trying to close a door against a high wind. And then she felt something from the other side starting to pull against her.Shut! she thought. Then she said, out loud, ""Come on, please."" And she felt the door begin to move, to pull closed, to give against the phantom wind.Suddenly she was aware of other people in the corridor with her. She could not turn her head to look at them, but she knew them without having to look. ""Help me, please,"" she said. ""All of you.""The other people in the corridor-three children, two adults-were somehow too insubstantial to touch the door. But their hands closed about hers, as she pulled on the big iron door handle, and suddenly she felt strong.""Never let up, Miss! Hold strong! Hold strong!"" whispered a voice in her mind.""Pull, girl, pull!"" whispered another.And then a voice that sounded like her mother's-her own mother, her real, wonderful, maddening, infuriating, glorious mother-just said, ""Well done, Coraline,"" and that was enough.The door started to slip closed, easily as anything.""No!"" screamed a voice from beyond the door, and it no longer sounded even faintly human.Something snatched at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap between the door and the doorpost. Coraline jerked her head out of the way, but the door began to open once more.""We're going to go home,"" said Coraline. ""We are. Help me."" She ducked the snatching fingers.They moved through her, then: ghost hands lent her strength that she no longer possessed. There was a final moment of resistance, as if something were caught in the door, and then, with a crash, the wooden door banged closed.Something dropped from Coraline's head height to the floor. It landed with a sort of a scuttling thump.""Come on!"" said the cat. ""This is not a good place to be in. Quickly.""Coraline turned her back on the door and began to run, as fast as was practical, through the dark corridor, running her hand along the wall to make sure she didn't bump into anything or get turned around in the darkness.It was an uphill run, and it seemed to her that it went on for a longer distance than anything could possibly go. The wall she was touching felt warm and yielding now, and, she realized, it felt as it were covered in a fine downy fur. It moved, as if it were taking a breath. She snatched her hand away from it.Winds howled in the dark.She was scared she would bump into something, and she put out her hand for the wall once more. This time what she touched felt hot and wet, as if she had put her hand in somebody's mouth, and she pulled it back with a small wail.Her eyes had adjusted to the dark. She could half see, as faintly glowing patches ahead of her, two adults, three children. She could hear the cat, too, padding in the dark in front of her.And there was something else, which suddenly scuttled between her feet, nearly sending Coraline flying. She caught herself before she went down, using her own momentum to keep moving. She knew that if she fell in that corridor she might never get up again. Whatever that corridor was was older by far than the other mother. It was deep, and slow, and it knew that she was there... .Then daylight appeared, and she ran toward it, puffing and wheezing. ""Almost there,"" she called encouragingly, but in the light she discovered that the wraiths had gone, and she was alone. She did not have time to wonder what had happened to them. Panting for breath, she staggered through the door, and slammed it behind her with the loudest, most satisfying bang you can imagine.Coraline locked the door with the key, and put the key back into her pocket.The black cat was huddled in the farthest corner of the room, the pink tip of its tongue showing, its eyes wide. Coraline went over to it and crouched down beside it.""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""I'm sorry I threw you at her. But it was the only way to distract her enough to get us all out. She would never have kept her word, would she?""The cat looked up at her, then rested its head on her hand, licking her fingers with its sandpapery tongue. It began to purr.""Then we're friends?"" said Coraline.She sat down on one of her grandmother's uncomfortable armchairs, and the cat sprang up into her lap and made itself comfortable. The light that came through the picture window was daylight, real golden late-afternoon daylight, not a white mist light. The sky was a robin's-egg blue, and Coraline could see trees and, beyond the trees, green hills, which faded on the horizon into purples and grays. The sky had never seemed so sky, the world had never seemed so world.Coraline stared at the leaves on the trees and at the patterns of light and shadow on the cracked bark of the trunk of the beech tree outside the window. Then she looked down at her lap, at the way that the rich sunlight brushed every hair on the cat's head, turning each white whisker to gold.Nothing, she thought, had ever been so interesting.And, caught up in the interestingness of the world, Coraline barely noticed that she had wriggled down and curled catlike on her grandmother's uncomfortable armchair, nor did she notice when she fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.
CL_ch12	CL	Coraline	12	1911	10638	XII.HER MOTHER SHOOK HER gently awake.""Coraline?"" she said. ""Darling, what a funny place to fall asleep. And really, this room is only for best. We looked all over the house for you.""Coraline stretched and blinked. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""I fell asleep.""""I can see that,"" said her mother. ""And wherever did the cat come from? He was waiting by the front door when I came in. Shot out like a bullet as I opened it.""""Probably had things to do,"" said Coraline. Then she hugged her mother so tightly that her arms began to ache. Her mother hugged Coraline back.""Dinner in fifteen minutes,"" said her mother. ""Don't forget to wash your hands. And just look at those pajama bottoms. What did you do to your poor knee?""""I tripped,"" said Coraline. She went into the bathroom, and she washed her hands and cleaned her bloody knee. She put ointment on her cuts and scrapes.She went into her bedroom-her real bedroom, her true bedroom. She pushed her hands into the pockets of her dressing gown, and she pulled out three marbles, a stone with a hole in it, the black key, and an empty snow globe.She shook the snow globe and watched the glittery snow swirl through the water to fill the empty world. She put it down and watched the snow fall, covering the place where the little couple had once stood.Coraline took a piece of string from her toy box, and she strung the black key on the string. Then she knotted the string and hung it around her neck.""There,"" she said. She put on some clothes and hid the key under her T-shirt. It was cold against her skin. The stone went into her pocket.Coraline walked down the hallway to her father's study. He had his back to her, but she knew, just on seeing him, that his eyes, when he turned around, would be her father's kind gray eyes, and she crept over and kissed him on the back of his balding head.""Hullo, Coraline,"" he said. Then he looked around and smiled at her. ""What was that for?""""Nothing,"" said Coraline. ""I just miss you sometimes. That's all.""""Oh good,"" he said. He put the computer to sleep, stood up, and then, for no reason at all, he picked Coraline up, which he had not done for such a long time, not since he had started pointing out to her she was much too old to be carried, and he carried her into the kitchen.Dinner that night was pizza, and even though it was homemade by her father (so the crust was alternately thick and doughy and raw, or too thin and burnt), and even though he had put slices of green pepper on it, along with little meatballs and, of all things, pineapple chunks, Coraline ate the entire slice she had been given.Well, she ate everything except for the pineapple chunks.And soon enough it was bedtime.Coraline kept the key around her neck, but she put the gray marbles beneath her pillow; and in bed that night, Coraline dreamed a dream.She was at a picnic, under an old oak tree, in a green meadow. The sun was high in the sky and while there were distant, fluffy white clouds on the horizon, the sky above her head was a deep, untroubled blue.There was a white linen cloth laid on the grass, with bowls piled high with food-she could see salads and sandwiches, nuts and fruit, jugs of lemonade and water and thick chocolate milk. Coraline sat on one side of the tablecloth while three other children took a side each. They were dressed in the oddest clothes.The smallest of them, sitting on Coraline's left, was a boy with red velvet knee britches and a frilly white shirt. His face was dirty, and he was piling his plate high with boiled new potatoes and with what looked like cold, whole, cooked, trout. ""This is the finest of pic-nics, lady,"" he said to her.""Yes,"" said Coraline. ""I think it is. I wonder who organized it.""""Why, I rather think you did, Miss,"" said a tall girl, sitting opposite Coraline. She wore a brown, rather shapeless dress, and had a brown bonnet on her head which tied beneath her chin. ""And we are more grateful for it and for all than ever words can say."" She was eating slices of bread and jam, deftly cutting the bread from a large golden-brown loaf with a huge knife, then spooning on the purple jam with a wooden spoon. She had jam all around her mouth.""Aye. This is the finest food I have eaten in centuries,"" said the girl on Coraline's right. She was a very pale child, dressed in what seemed to be spider's webs, with a circle of glittering silver set in her blonde hair. Coraline could have sworn that the girl had two wings-like dusty silver butterfly wings, not bird wings-coming out of her back. The girl's plate was piled high with pretty flowers. She smiled at Coraline, as if it had been a very long time since she had smiled and she had almost, but not quite, forgotten how. Coraline found herself liking this girl immensely.And then, in the way of dreams, the picnic was done and they were playing in the meadow, running and shouting and tossing a glittering ball from one to another. Coraline knew it was a dream then, because none of them ever got tired or winded or out of breath. She wasn't even sweating. They just laughed and ran in a game that was partly tag, partly piggy-in-the-middle, and partly just a magnificent romp.Three of them ran along the ground, while the pale girl fluttered a little over their heads, swooping down on butterfly wings to grab the ball and swing up again into the sky before she tossed the ball to one of the other children.And then, without a word about it being spoken, the game was done, and the four of them went back to the picnic cloth, where the lunch dishes had been cleared away, and there were four bowls waiting for them, three of ice cream, one of honeysuckle flowers piled high.They ate with relish.""Thank you for coming to my party,"" said Coraline. ""If it is mine.""""The pleasure is ours, Coraline Jones,"" said the winged girl, nibbling another honeysuckle blossom. ""If there were but something we could do for you, to thank you and to reward you.""""Aye,"" said the boy with the red velvet britches and the dirty face. He put out his hand and held Coraline's hand with his own. It was warm now.""It's a very fine thing you did for us, Miss,"" said the tall girl. She now had a smear of chocolate ice cream all around her lips.""I'm just pleased it's all over,"" said Coraline.Was it her imagination, or did a shadow cross the faces of the other children at the picnic?The winged girl, the circlet in her hair glittering like a star, rested her fingers for a moment on the back of Coraline's hand. ""It is over and done with for us,"" she said. ""This is our staging post. From here, we three will set out for uncharted lands, and what comes after no one alive can say... ."" She stopped talking.""There's a but, isn't there?"" said Coraline. ""I can feel it. Like a rain cloud.""The boy on her left tried to smile bravely, but his lower lip began to tremble and he bit it with his upper teeth and said nothing. The girl in the brown bonnet shifted uncomfortably and said, ""Yes, Miss.""""But I got you three back,"" said Coraline. ""I got Mum and Dad back. I shut the door. I locked it. What more was I meant to do?""The boy squeezed Coraline's hand with his. She found herself remembering when it had been she, trying to reassure him, when he was little more than a cold memory in the darkness.""Well, can't you give me a clue?"" asked Coraline. ""Isn't there something you can tell me?""""The beldam swore by her good right hand,"" said the tall girl, ""but she lied.""""M-my governess,"" said the boy, ""used to say that nobody is ever given more to shoulder than he or she can bear."" He shrugged as he said this, as if he had not yet made his own mind up whether or not it was true.""We wish you luck,"" said the winged girl. ""Good fortune and wisdom and courage-although you have already shown that you have all three of these blessings, and in abundance.""""She hates you,"" blurted out the boy. ""She hasn't lost anything for so long. Be wise. Be brave. Be tricky.""""But it's not fair,"" said Coraline, in her dream, angrily. ""It's just not fair. It should be over.""The boy with the dirty face stood up and hugged Coraline tightly. ""Take comfort in this,"" he whispered. ""Th'art alive. Thou livest.""And in her dream Coraline saw that the sun had set and the stars were twinkling in the darkening sky.Coraline stood in the meadow, and she watched as the three children (two of them walking, one flying) went away from her across the grass, silver in the light of the huge moon.The three of them came to a small wooden bridge over a stream. They stopped there and turned and waved, and Coraline waved back.And what came after was darkness.Coraline woke in the early hours of the morning, convinced she had heard something moving, but unsure what it was.She waited.Something made a rustling noise outside her bedroom door. She wondered if it was a rat. The door rattled. Coraline clambered out of bed.""Go away,"" said Coraline sharply. ""Go away or you'll be sorry.""There was a pause, then the whatever it was scuttled away down the hall. There was something odd and irregular about its footsteps, if they were footsteps. Coraline found herself wondering if it was perhaps a rat with an extra leg... .""It isn't over, is it?"" she said to herself.Then she opened the bedroom door. The gray, predawn light showed her the whole of the corridor, completely deserted.She went toward the front door, sparing a hasty glance back at the wardrobe-door mirror hanging on the wall at the other end of the hallway, seeing nothing but her own pale face staring back at her, looking sleepy and serious. Gentle, reassuring snores came from her parents' room, but the door was closed. All the doors off the corridor were closed. Whatever the scuttling thing was, it had to be here somewhere.Coraline opened the front door and looked at the gray sky. She wondered how long it would be until the sun came up, wondered whether her dream had been a true thing while knowing in her heart that it had been. Something she had taken to be part of the shadows under the hall couch detached itself from beneath the couch and made a mad, scrabbling rush on its long white legs, heading for the front door.Coraline's mouth dropped open in horror and she stepped out of the way as the thing clicked and scuttled past her and out of the house, running crablike on its too-many tapping, clicking, scurrying feet.She knew what it was, and she knew what it was after. She had seen it too many times in the last few days, reaching and clutching and snatching and popping blackbeetles obediently into the other mother's mouth. Five-footed, crimson-nailed, the color of bone.It was the other mother's right hand.It wanted the black key.
CL_ch13	CL	Coraline	13	2743	15369	XIII.CORALINE'S PARENTS NEVER SEEMED to remember anything about their time in the snow globe. At least, they never said anything about it, and Coraline never mentioned it to them.Sometimes she wondered whether they had ever noticed that they had lost two days in the real world, and came to the eventual conclusion that they had not. Then again, there are some people who keep track of every day and every hour, and there are people who don't, and Coraline's parents were solidly in the second camp.Coraline had placed the marbles beneath her pillow before she went to sleep that first night home in her own room once more. She went back to bed after she saw the other mother's hand, although there was not much time left for sleeping, and she rested her head back on that pillow.Something scrunched gently as she did.She sat up, and lifted the pillow. The fragments of the glass marbles that she saw looked like the remains of eggshells one finds beneath trees in springtime: like empty, broken robin's eggs, or even more delicate-wren's eggs, perhaps.Whatever had been inside the glass spheres had gone. Coraline thought of the three children waving good-bye to her in the moonlight, waving before they crossed that silver stream.She gathered up the eggshell-thin fragments with care and placed them in a small blue box which had once held a bracelet that her grandmother had given her when she was a little girl. The bracelet was long lost, but the box remained.Miss Spink and Miss Forcible came back from visiting Miss Spink's niece, and Coraline went down to their flat for tea. It was a Monday. On Wednesday Coraline would go back to school: a whole new school year would begin.Miss Forcible insisted on reading Coraline's tea leaves.""Well, looks like everything's mostly shipshape and Bristol fashion, luvvy,"" said Miss Forcible.""Sorry?"" said Coraline.""Everything is coming up roses,"" said Miss Forcible. ""Well, almost everything. I'm not sure what that is."" She pointed to a clump of tea leaves sticking to the side of the cup.Miss Spink tutted and reached for the cup. ""Honestly, Miriam. Give it over here. Let me see... .""She blinked through her thick spectacles. ""Oh dear. No, I have no idea what that signifies. It looks almost like a hand.""Coraline looked. The clump of leaves did look a little like a hand, reaching for something.Hamish the Scottie dog was hiding under Miss Forcible's chair, and he wouldn't come out.""I think he was in some sort of fight,"" said Miss Spink. ""He has a deep gash in his side, poor dear. We'll take him to the vet later this afternoon. I wish I knew what could have done it.""Something, Coraline knew, would have to be done.That final week of the holidays, the weather was magnificent, as if the summer itself were trying to make up for the miserable weather they had been having by giving them some bright and glorious days before it ended.The crazy old man upstairs called down to Coraline when he saw her coming out of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's flat.""Hey! Hi! You! Caroline!"" he shouted over the railing.""It's Coraline,"" she said. ""How are the mice?""""Something has frightened them,"" said the old man, scratching his mustache. ""I think maybe there is a weasel in the house. Something is about. I heard it in the night. In my country we would have put down a trap for it, maybe put down a little meat or hamburger, and when the creature comes to feast, then-bam!-it would be caught and never bother us more. The mice are so scared they will not even pick up their little musical instruments.""""I don't think it wants meat,"" said Coraline. She put her hand up and touched the black key that hung about her neck. Then she went inside.She bathed herself, and kept the key around her neck the whole time she was in the bath. She never took it off anymore.Something scratched at her bedroom window after she went to bed. Coraline was almost asleep, but she slipped out of her bed and pulled open the curtains. A white hand with crimson fingernails leapt from the window ledge onto a drainpipe and was immediately out of sight. There were deep gouges in the glass on the other side of the window.Coraline slept uneasily that night, waking from time to time to plot and plan and ponder, then falling back into sleep, never quite certain where her pondering ended and the dream began, one ear always open for the sound of something scratching at her windowpane or at her bedroom door.In the morning Coraline said to her mother, ""I'm going to have a picnic with my dolls today. Can I borrow a sheet-an old one, one you don't need any longer-as a tablecloth?""""I don't think we have one of those,"" said her mother. She opened the kitchen drawer that held the napkins and the tablecloths, and she prodded about in it. ""Hold on. Will this do?""It was a folded-up disposable paper tablecloth covered with red flowers, left over from some picnic they had been on several years before.""That's perfect,"" said Coraline.""I didn't think you played with your dolls anymore,"" said Mrs. Jones.""I don't,"" admitted Coraline. ""They're protective color-ation.""""Well, be back in time for lunch,"" said her mother. ""Have a good time.""Coraline filled a cardboard box with dolls and with several plastic doll's teacups. She filled a jug with water.Then she went outside. She walked down to the road, just as if she were going to the shops. Before she reached the supermarket she cut across a fence into some wasteland and along an old drive, then crawled under a hedge. She had to go under the hedge in two journeys in order not to spill the water from the jug.It was a long, roundabout looping journey, but at the end of it Coraline was satisfied that she had not been followed.She came out behind the dilapidated old tennis court. She crossed over it, to the meadow where the long grass swayed. She found the planks on the edge of the meadow. They were astonishingly heavy-almost too heavy for a girl to lift, even using all her strength, but she managed. She didn't have any choice. She pulled the planks out of the way, one by one, grunting and sweating with the effort, revealing a deep, round, brick-lined hole in the ground. It smelled of damp and the dark. The bricks were greenish, and slippery.She spread out the tablecloth and laid it, carefully, over the top of the well. She put a plastic doll's cup every foot or so, at the edge of the well, and she weighed each cup down with water from the jug.She put a doll in the grass beside each cup, making it look as much like a doll's tea party as she could. Then she retraced her steps, back under the hedge, along the dusty yellow drive, around the back of the shops, back to her house.She reached up and took the key from around her neck. She dangled it from the string, as if the key were just something she liked to play with. Then she knocked on the door of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's flat.Miss Spink opened the door.""Hello dear,"" she said.""I don't want to come in,"" said Coraline. ""I just wanted to find out how Hamish was doing.""Miss Spink sighed. ""The vet says that Hamish is a brave little soldier,"" she said. ""Luckily, the cut doesn't seem to be infected. We cannot imagine what could have done it. The vet says some animal, he thinks, but has no idea what. Mister Bobo says he thinks it might have been a weasel.""""Mister Bobo?""""The man in the top flat. Mister Bobo. Fine old circus family, I believe. Romanian or Slovenian or Livonian, or one of those countries. Bless me, I can never remember them anymore.""It had never occurred to Coraline that the crazy old man upstairs actually had a name, she realized. If she'd known his name was Mr. Bobo she would have said it every chance she got. How often do you get to say a name like ""Mr. Bobo"" aloud?""Oh,"" said Coraline to Miss Spink. ""Mister Bobo. Right. Well,"" she said, a little louder, ""I'm going to go and play with my dolls now, over by the old tennis court, round the back.""""That's nice, dear,"" said Miss Spink. Then she added confidentially, ""Make sure you keep an eye out for the old well. Mister Lovat, who was here before your time, said that he thought it might go down for half a mile or more.""Coraline hoped that the hand had not heard this last, and she changed the subject. ""This key?"" said Coraline loudly. ""Oh, it's just some old key from our house. It's part of my game. That's why I'm carrying it around with me on this piece of string. Well, good-bye now.""""What an extraordinary child,"" said Miss Spink to herself as she closed the door.Coraline ambled across the meadow toward the old tennis court, dangling and swinging the black key on its piece of string as she walked.Several times she thought she saw something the color of bone in the undergrowth. It was keeping pace with her, about thirty feet away.She tried to whistle, but nothing happened, so she sang out loud instead, a song her father had made up for her when she was a little baby and which had always made her laugh. It went,Oh-my twitchy witchy girlI think you are so nice,I give you bowls of porridgeAnd I give you bowls of iceCream.I give you lots of kisses,And I give you lots of hugs,But I never give you sandwichesWith bugsIn.That was what she sang as she sauntered through the woods, and her voice hardly trembled at all.The dolls' tea party was where she had left it. She was relieved that it was not a windy day, for everything was still in its place, every water-filled plastic cup weighed down the paper tablecloth as it was meant to. She breathed a sigh of relief.Now was the hardest part.""Hello dolls,"" she said brightly. ""It's teatime!""She walked close to the paper tablecloth. ""I brought the lucky key,"" she told the dolls, ""to make sure we have a good picnic.""And then, as carefully as she could, she leaned over and, gently, placed the key on the tablecloth. She was still holding on to the string. She held her breath, hoping that the cups of water at the edges of the well would weigh the cloth down, letting it take the weight of the key without collapsing into the well.The key sat in the middle of the paper picnic cloth. Coraline let go of the string, and took a step back. Now it was all up to the hand.She turned to her dolls.""Who would like a piece of cherry cake?"" she asked. ""Jemima? Pinky? Primrose?"" and she served each doll a slice of invisible cake on an invisible plate, chattering happily as she did so.From the corner of her eye she saw something bone white scamper from one tree trunk to another, closer and closer. She forced herself not to look at it.""Jemima!"" said Coraline. ""What a bad girl you are! You've dropped your cake! Now I'll have to go over and get you a whole new slice!"" And she walked around the tea party until she was on the other side of it to the hand. She pretended to clean up spilled cake, and to get Jemima another piece.And then, in a skittering, chittering rush, it came. The hand, running high on its fingertips, scrabbled through the tall grass and up onto a tree stump. It stood there for a moment, like a crab tasting the air, and then it made one triumphant, nail-clacking leap onto the center of the paper tablecloth.Time slowed for Coraline. The white fingers closed around the black key... .And then the weight and the momentum of the hand sent the plastic dolls' cups flying, and the paper tablecloth, the key, and the other mother's right hand went tumbling down into the darkness of the well.Coraline counted slowly under her breath. She got up to forty before she heard a muffled splash coming from a long way below.Someone had once told her that if you look up at the sky from the bottom of a mine shaft, even in the brightest daylight, you see a night sky and stars. Coraline wondered if the hand could see stars from where it was.She hauled the heavy planks back onto the well, covering it as carefully as she could. She didn't want anything to fall in. She didn't want anything ever to get out.Then she put her dolls and the cups back in the cardboard box she had carried them out in. Something caught her eye while she was doing this, and she straightened up in time to see the black cat stalking toward her, its tail held high and curling at the tip like a question mark. It was the first time she had seen the cat in several days, since they had returned together from the other mother's place.The cat walked over to her and jumped up onto the planks that covered the well. Then, slowly, it winked one eye at her.It sprang down into the long grass in front of her, and rolled over onto its back, wiggling about ecstatically.Coraline scratched and tickled the soft fur on its belly, and the cat purred contentedly. When it had had enough it rolled over onto its front once more and walked back toward the tennis court, like a tiny patch of midnight in the midday sun.Coraline went back to the house.Mr. Bobo was waiting for her in the driveway. He clapped her on the shoulder.""The mice tell me that all is good,"" he said. ""They say that you are our savior, Caroline.""""It's Coraline, Mister Bobo,"" said Coraline. ""Not Caroline. Coraline.""""Coraline,"" said Mr. Bobo, repeating her name to himself with wonderment and respect. ""Very good, Coraline. The mice say that I must tell you that as soon as they are ready to perform in public, you will come up and watch them as the first audience of all. They will play tumpty umpty and toodle oodle, and they will dance, and do a thousand tricks. That is what is they say.""""I would like that very much,"" said Coraline. ""When they're ready.""She knocked at Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's door. Miss Spink let her in and Coraline went into their parlor. She put her box of dolls down on the floor. Then she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out the stone with the hole in it.""Here you go,"" she said. ""I don't need it anymore. I'm very grateful. I think it may have saved my life, and saved some other people's death.""She gave them both tight hugs, although her arms barely stretched around Miss Spink, and Miss Forcible smelled like the raw garlic she had been cutting. Then Coraline picked up her box of dolls and went out.""What an extraordinary child,"" said Miss Spink. No one had hugged her like that since she had retired from the theater.That night Coraline lay in bed, all bathed, teeth cleaned, with her eyes open, staring up at the ceiling.It was warm enough that, now that the hand was gone, she had opened her bedroom window wide. She had in-sisted to her father that the curtains not be entirely closed.Her new school clothes were laid out carefully on her chair for her to put on when she woke.Normally, on the night before the first day of term, Coraline was apprehensive and nervous. But, she realized, there was nothing left about school that could scare her anymore.She fancied she could hear sweet music on the night air: the kind of music that can only be played on the tiniest silver trombones and trumpets and bassoons, on piccolos and tubas so delicate and small that their keys could only be pressed by the tiny pink fingers of white mice.Coraline imagined that she was back again in her dream, with the two girls and the boy under the oak tree in the meadow, and she smiled.As the first stars came out Coraline finally allowed herself to drift into sleep, while the gentle upstairs music of the mouse circus spilled out onto the warm evening air, telling the world that the summer was almost done.

There was only orange juice in the fridge. Nothing else that you could put on cereal, unless you think that ketchup or mayonnaise or pickle juice would be nice on your Toastios, which I do not, and neither did my little sister, although she has eaten some pretty weird things in her day, like mushrooms in chocolate.*

""No milk,"" said my sister.

""Nope,"" I said, looking behind the jam in the fridge, just in case. ""None at all.""


Our mum had gone off to a conference. She was presenting a paper on lizards. Before she went, she reminded us of the important things that had to happen while she was away.
My dad was reading the paper. I do not think he pays a lot of attention to the world while he is reading his paper.
""Did you hear me?"" asked my mum, who is suspicious. ""What did I say?""


""Do not forget to take the kids to Orchestra Practice on Saturday; it's Violin on Wednesday night; you've frozen a dinner for each night you're away and labeled them; the spare house-key is with the Nicolsons; the plumber will be here on Monday morning and do not use or flush the upstairs toilet until he's been; feed the goldfish; you love us and you'll be back on Thursday,"" said my father.

I think my mum was surprised. ""Yes, that's right,"" she said. She kissed us all. Then she said, ""Oh, and we're almost out of milk. You'll need to pick some up.""

After she went away, my dad had a cup of tea. There was still some milk left.
We defrosted Meal Number One, but we made a bit of a mess of things, so we went to the Indian restaurant. Before we went to sleep, Dad made us mugs of hot chocolate to make up for the whole Missing of Mum.
That was last night.



Now Dad came in. ""Eat your cereal,"" he said. ""Remember, it's Orchestra Practice this afternoon.""
""We can't eat our cereal,"" said my sister, sadly.
""I don't see why not,"" said my father. ""We've got plenty of cereal. There's Toastios and there's muesli. We have bowls. We have spoons. Spoons are excellent. Sort of like forks, only not as stabby.""
""No milk,"" I said.
""No milk,"" said my sister.
I watched my dad think about this. He looked like he was going to suggest that we have something for breakfast that you do not need milk for, like sausages, but then he looked like he remembered that, without milk, he couldn't have his tea. He had his ""no tea"" face.
""You poor children,"" he said. ""I will walk down to the shop on the corner. I will get milk.""
""Thank you,"" said my sister.

""Not the fat-free kind,"" I told him. ""That stuff tastes like water.""
""Right,"" said my dad. ""Not the fat-free kind.""
He went out.
I poured some Toastios into a bowl. I stared at them.
I waited.





""How long has he been?"" asked my sister.
""Ages,"" I said.
""I thought so,"" said my little sister.
We drank orange juice. My sister practiced her violin. I suggested that she stop playing her violin, and she did.
My sister made faces at me.
""How long has it been now?"" she asked.
""Ages and ages,"" I told her.

""What happens if he never comes back?"" she asked.
""I suppose we eat the pickles,"" I said.
""You can't eat pickles for breakfast,"" said my sister. ""And I don't like pickles at any time. What if something awful has happened to him? Mum would blame us.""
""I expect he just ran into one of his friends at the corner shop,"" I said, ""and they got talking and he lost track of time.""
I ate a dry Toastio as an experiment. It was sort of okay, but not as good as in milk.

There was a thump and a bang at the front door, and my father came in.
""Where have you been all this time?"" asked my sister.
""Ah,"" said my father. ""Um. Yes. Well, funny you should ask me that.""
""You ran into someone you knew,"" I said, ""and you lost track of time.""
""I bought the milk,"" said my father. ""And I did indeed say a brief hello to Mister Ronson from over the road, who was buying a paper. I walked out of the corner shop, and heard something odd that seemed to be coming from above me. It was a noise like this: thummthumm. I looked up and saw a huge silver disc hovering in the air above Marshall Road.""
""Hullo,"" I said to myself. ""That's not something you see every day. And then something odd happened.""
""That wasn't odd?"" I asked.
""Well, something ODDER,"" said my father. ""The odd thing was the beam of light that came out of the disc-a glittery, shimmery beam of light that was visible even in the daylight. And the next thing I knew, I was being sucked up into the disc. Fortunately, I had put the milk into my coat pocket.

""The deck of the disc was metal. It was as big as a playing field, or BIGGER.""
FTM_ch3	FTM	Fortunately, the Milk	3	797	4204	""We have come to your planet from a world very far away,"" said the people in the disc.
I call them people, but they were a bit green and rather globby and they looked very grumpy indeed.
""Now, as a representative of your species, we demand that you give us ownership of the whole planet. We are going to remodel it.""
""I jolly well won't,"" I said.


""Then,"" it said, ""we will bring all your enemies here and have them make you miserable until you agree to sign the planet over to us.""
I was going to point out to them that I didn't have any enemies when I noticed a large metal door with 
EMERGENCY EXITDO NOT OPEN FOR ANY REASONTHIS MEANS YOU!
on it. I opened the door.
""Don't do that,"" said a green, globby person. ""You'll let the space-time continuum in.""
But it was too late; I had already pushed open the door.
I JUMPED.

I was FALLING.

Fortunately, I had kept tight hold of the milk, so when I splashed into the sea I didn't lose it.
""What was that?"" said a woman's voice. ""A big fish? A mermaid? Or was it a spy?""
I wanted to say that I wasn't any of those things, but my mouth was full of seawater. I felt myself being hauled up onto the deck of a little ship. There were a number of men and a woman on the deck, and they all looked very cross.

""Who be ye, landlubber?"" said the woman, who had a big hat on her head and a parrot on her shoulder.
""He's a spy! A walrus in a coat! A new kind of mermaid with legs!"" said the men.
""What are you doing here?"" asked the woman.
""Well,"" I said. ""I just set out to the corner shop for some milk for my children's breakfast and for my tea, and the next thing I knew-""
""He's lying, Your Majesty!""
She pulled out her cutlass. ""You dare lie to the Queen of the Pirates?""
Fortunately, I had kept tight hold of the milk, and now I pointed to it.

""If I did not go to the corner shop to fetch the milk,"" I asked them, ""then where did this milk come from?""
At this, the pirates were completely speechless. ""Now,"" I said, ""if you could let me off somewhere near to my destination, I would be much obliged to you.""


""And where would that happen to be?"" said the Queen of the Pirates.

""On the corner of Marshall Road and Fletcher Lane,"" I said. ""My children are waiting there for their breakfast.""
""You're on a pirate ship now, my fine bucko,"" said the Pirate Queen. ""And you don't get dropped off anywhere. There are only two choices-you can join my pirate crew, or refuse to join and we will slit your cowardly throat and you will go to the bottom of the sea, where you will feed the fishes.""
""What about walking the plank?"" I asked.
""NEVER heard of it!"" said the pirates.
""Walking the plank!"" I said. ""It's what proper pirates do! Look, I'll show you. Do you have a plank anywhere?""
It took some looking, but we found a plank, and I showed the pirates where to put it. We discussed nailing it down, but the Pirate Queen decided it was safer just to have the two fattest pirates sit on the end of it.
""Why exactly do you want to walk the plank?"" asked the Pirate Queen.

I edged out onto the plank. The blue Caribbean water splashed gently beneath me.
""Well,"" I said, ""I've seen lots of stories with pirates in them, and it seems to me that if I'm going to be rescued-""
At this, the pirates started to laugh so hard their stomachs wobbled, and the parrot took off into the air in amazement. ""Rescue?"" they said. ""There's no rescue out here. We're in the middle of the sea.""
""Nevertheless,"" I told them. ""If you are going to be rescued, it will always be while walking the plank.""
""Which we don't do,"" said the Pirate Queen. ""Here. Have a SPANISH DOUBLOON and come and join us in our piratical adventures. It's the eighteenth century,"" she added, ""and there's always room for a bright, enthusiastic pirate.""
I caught the doubloon. ""I almost wish that I could,"" I told her. ""But I have children. And they need their breakfast.""

""Then you must die!Walk the plank!""
I edged out to the end of the plank. Sharks were circling. So were piranhas-

And this was whereI interrupted my dad forTHE FIRST TIME.
""Hang on,"" I said. ""Piranhas are a freshwater fish. What were they doing in the sea?""


""You're right,"" said my father. ""The piranhas were later. Right. So . . .""
FTM_ch4	FTM	Fortunately, the Milk	4	1408	7774	I was out at the end of the plank, facing certain death, when a rope ladder hit my shoulder and a deep, booming voice shouted,


""QUICKLY! CLIMB UP THE ROPE LADDER!""

I needed no more encouragement than this, and I grabbed the rope ladder with both hands. Fortunately, the milk was pushed deep into the pocket of my coat. The pirates hurled insults at me, and even discharged pistols, but neither insults nor pistol-shot found their targets and I soon made it to the top of the rope ladder.

I'd never been in the basket of a hot air balloon before. It was very peaceful up there.
The person in the balloon basket said, ""I hope you don't mind me helping, but it looked like you were having problems down there.""
I said, ""You're a stegosaurus!""
""I am an inventor,"" he said. ""I have invented the thing we are traveling in, which I call Professor Steg's Floaty-Ball-Person-Carrier.""
""I call it a balloon,"" I said.
""Professor Steg's Floaty-Ball-Person-Carrier is the original name,"" he said. ""And right now we are one hundred and fifty million years in the future.""
""Actually,"" I said, ""we are about three hundred years in the past.""
""Do you like hard-hairy-wet-white-crunchers?"" he asked.
""Coconuts?"" I guessed.
""I named them first,"" said Professor Steg. He picked up a coconut from a basket and ate it, shell and all, just as you or I might crunch toast.

He showed me his Time Machine. He was very proud of it. It was a large cardboard box with several pebbles on it, and stones stuck to the side. There was also a large, red button. I looked at the stones. ""Hang on,"" I said. ""Those are diamonds. And sapphires. And rubies.""


""Actually,"" he said, ""I call them special-shiny-clear-stones, special-shiny-bluey-stones, and, um-""
""Special-shiny-red-stones?"" I suggested.
""Indeed,"" he said. ""I called them that when I was inventing my Really Good Moves Around in Time Machine, one hundred and fifty million years ago.""
""Well,"" I told him, ""it was very lucky for me that you turned up when you did and rescued me. I am slightly lost in space and time right now and need to get home in order to make sure my children get milk for their breakfast."" I showed it to him. ""This is the milk. Although I expect that one hundred and fifty million years ago you called it 'wet-white-drinky-stuff.'""
""Dinosaurs are reptiles, sir,"" said Professor Steg. ""We do not go in for milk.""
""Do you go in for breakfast cereal?"" I asked.
""Of course!"" he said. ""Dinosaurs LOVE breakfast cereal. Especially the kind with nuts in.""

""What do you have on your cereal?"" I asked.
""Orange juice, mostly. Or we just eat it dry. But I shall put this in my book: In the distant future, small mammals put milk on their breakfast cereal. I shall write a wonderful book, when I return to the present.""
""Actually,"" I said, ""I think this is definitely the past. It has pirates in it.""
""It's the future,"" he said. ""All the dinosaurs have gone off into the stars, leaving the world to mammals.""
""I wondered where you all went,"" I said.
""The stars,"" he told me. ""That is where we will have gone.""
""So,"" I said. ""Can you take me home?""
""Well,"" he said. ""Yes and no.""
""What does that mean?""
""Yes, I would love to take you home. Nothing would make me happier. No, I cannot take you home. In all honesty, I do not believe that I can take me home. My Time Machine is being temperamental. I need a special-shiny-greeny-stone. I have pressed that button many times but nothing happens.""
""Button? Don't you mean 'big-red-flat-pressy-thing'?"" I asked.
""I most certainly do not. It is a button. I named it after my Aunt Button.""
""Can I press it?""
""If you wish.""
I pressed the button. The sun shot around the sky, and the sky started to flicker in nights and in days, and the balloon began to rock and lurch and zoom around like an angry fly.
I held on to the ropes as hard as I could. Fortunately, I was still keeping tight hold of the milk in my right hand.
When we stopped being blown all across the sky, it was night and, according to Professor Steg, we had only gone back about a thousand years. The moon was nearly full.
""I am even further from my children and our breakfast,"" I said.
""You have your milk,"" he said. ""Where there is milk, there is hope. Ah, over there. That looks like a perfect landing platform for time-traveling scientists in Floaty-Ball-Person-Carriers.""


We landed on the platform and got out. The platform stuck up out of the jungle and had flaming torches on each side. There were people standing on it with very black hair and sharp stone knives.


""Is this a balloon-landing platform?"" I asked the people.
""It is not,"" said a fat man. ""It is our temple. We had a very bad harvest last year and we had just asked the gods to send us a sacrifice, to make sure that this year's harvest is better, when you floated down in that thing, with your monster.""

""Thank you, by the way,"" said a little thin man. ""I was going to be the sacrifice if no one else turned up. Much obliged.""
""So now we will sacrifice you and your monster.""
""But my children are waiting for their breakfast,"" I said. ""Look!"" I held up the milk.
""Why did they all just fall to their knees?"" asked Professor Steg. ""Is this usual hairless mammal behavior? Perhaps I should hold up some hard-hairy-wet-white-crunchers and see what happens.""

""Coconuts!"" I told him. ""They are called coconuts!""
""What is that you are holding?"" the fat man asked.
""Milk,"" I said.
""MILK!"" they exclaimed, and they prostrated themselves on the ground.

""We have a prophecy,"" said the fat man, ""that when a man and a spiny-backed monster descend from the skies on a round floaty thing-""
""Floaty-Ball-Person-Carrier,"" said the little thin man.
""Yes. One of those. We were told that when that happened, if the man held up milk then we were not to sacrifice them, but we were meant to take them to the volcano, and give them, as a present, the green jewel that is the Eye of Splod.""
""Splod?""
""He is the god of people with short, funny names.""
""It is,"" I said, ""a remarkably specific sort of a prophecy. When did you receive it?""

""Last Wednesday,"" said the fat man, proudly. ""The priest of Splod was woken in the night by a voice whispering from the heavens. And when he went to look and see who it was, there was nobody there. Also, he was sleeping on the top of the temple, and nobody else could have been up there with him. So it must have either been Splod himself talking, or one of his angelic messengers.""

We walked together down a jungle path. Professor Steg carried the rope in his mouth that led up to the balloon, and he dragged the balloon along. After half an hour we reached the volcano.
It was not a very big volcano. There were wisps of smoke coming from the top of it.
On the side of the volcano there was a carving of a big scary face with one eye in the middle of its forehead. The eye was the biggest emerald I had ever seen.
""A special-shiny-greeny-stone!"" said Professor Steg, with his mouth full of rope.
The fat man clambered up the side of the volcano.
""It is a good thing that Splod himself told us to give you the Eye of Splod,"" said the little thin man who had narrowly avoided being sacrificed, ""because there is another prophecy that if the Eye of Splod is ever removed, Great Splod will awaken and spread burning destruction across the land.""
""Here you go,"" said the fat man.
He handed us the emerald. Professor Steg nipped up the rope ladder into the balloon's gondola and began to install the emerald in the Time Machine.
""Hang on. He was a stegosaurus?""
""Yes.""



""Then how could he just nip up a rope ladder?""
""He was,"" said my father, ""a large stegosaurus, but very light on his feet. There are fat people who are excellent dancers.""
""Are there any ponies in this?"" asked my sister. ""I thought there would be ponies by now.""
FTM_ch5	FTM	Fortunately, the Milk	5	622	3365	I was standing on the ground, holding on to the rope ladder, when the ground shook and the very small volcano began to belch smoke and lava.
""Splod is angry!"" shouted the little thin man. ""He wants his eye back.""
There was a rushing wind, and the balloon jerked me up into the air, high above the splurting lava.
Unfortunately, I dropped the milk. I wasn't holding on to it tightly enough. It landed on the top of Splod's head.
Professor Steg hauled the rope ladder up with his tail.
""I'VE LOST THE MILK!"" I told him.
""That's not good,"" he admitted.
""But I know where it is. It's on top of Splod's head, on the side of the volcano.""
Professor Steg said, ""Good Splod! What on earth is that?""
Before our eyes, another balloon, just like ours, appeared, over by the volcano. A man hurried down the rope ladder. He placed a large emerald in Splod's eye, picked up the milk from Splod's head, ran up the ladder, and the balloon vanished.


The very small volcano stopped erupting as suddenly as if it had been turned off.
""That was a bit peculiar, wasn't it?"" said the professor.
""It was,"" I agreed, gloom and despair and despondency overcoming me. ""That man in that balloon stole my milk. We are lost in the past, with jungles and pirates and volcanoes. Now I will never get home. My children will never have breakfast. We are doomed to float forever through the dusty air of the past in a hot air balloon.""

""It is not a balloon,"" said Professor Steg. ""It is a Floaty-Ball-Person-Carrier. What nonsense you do talk. Now, I think that should do the trick.""
He finished attaching the emerald to the box, using string, mostly, and also sticky tape, and he pushed the red button.
""Where are we going?"" I asked. It seemed like the sun was zooming across the sky, as if nights were following days in a flickering strobe.
""The far, far future!"" said Professor Steg.
The machine stopped.
We were hanging in the air above a grassy plain, with a very small grey mountain beneath us.
""There,"" said Professor Steg. ""It is now an extinct volcano. BUT LOOK!""



On the side of the extinct volcano was carved the face of Splod, still recognizable, even though it was much eroded by time and the weather, and in the single eye was a huge green emerald, a perfect twin to the one that we had attached to the Time Machine.
""Right,"" said Professor Steg. ""Grab me that special-shiny-greeny-stone.""
I went over the side of the gondola and down the rope ladder. I pulled the emerald out of the eye socket.

Below me, on the plain, a number of brightly colored ponies were gathered, and when I picked up the emerald, one of them shouted up at me. ""You must be the man without the milk. We have heard about you, in our tales.""
""Why are you a pink pony with a pale blue star on the side?"" I asked.
""I know,"" said the pony with a sigh. ""It's what everybody's wearing these days. Pale blue stars are so last year.""
Professor Steg leaned over the side of the balloon's basket. ""Hurry up!"" he called. ""If the volcano is going to go off, it will do it any moment.""
The volcano made a noise like a huge burp, and the middle of it collapsed into itself.
""We thought it would do that,"" said a green pony with a sparkly mane.
""There was a prophecy, I suppose,"" I said.
""No. We're just very clever."" All the ponies nodded. They were very clever ponies.

""I am so glad there were ponies,"" said my sister.
FTM_ch6	FTM	Fortunately, the Milk	6	1213	6854	I got back into the balloon basket. Professor Steg unhooked the first emerald from his Time Machine and replaced it with the one that I had just taken from the weathered face of Splod-in-the-Future.

""Do not, whatever else you might do,"" said the professor, ""touch those two stones together.""

""Why not?""
""Because, according to my calculations, if the same object from two different times touches itself, one of two things will happen. Either the Universe will cease to exist. Or three remarkable dwarfs will dance through the streets with flowerpots on their heads.""
""That sounds astonishingly specific,"" I said.
""I know. But it is science. And it is much more probable that the Universe will end.""
""I thought it would be,"" I said.
""You look so sad,"" Professor Steg told me.
""I am! It's the milk. My children are breakfastless-""
""The milk!"" said Professor Steg. ""Of course!"" And with that, Professor Steg pressed the red button with his heavily armored tail.
There was a ZOOM, a TWORP, and a THANG, and we were hurtling through the cosmic void.
And then it was dark.
Very dark.

""Oops,"" said Professor Steg. ""Overshot a little. Only by a week, though. Hold on. . . .""
Professor Steg leaned over the side of the basket.
""Excuse me?"" he said. ""Is there anyone around?""
""Only me,"" said a very surprised-sounding voice from below us. ""The priest of Splod. Who is that up in the sky? Is it a bird? You do not sound like a bird.""
""I am not a bird,"" said Professor Steg. ""I am a marvelous yet mysterious and prophetic voice, telling you a mighty prophecy. So mighty that . . . Um . . . Very mighty indeed. Listen. When a huge and good-looking spiny-backed individual-""
""Monster,"" I told him. ""The prophecy said monster.""
""Accompanied by a scrawny human being of revolting appearance-"" said Professor Steg.



""That was not necessary.""
""-lands in a Floaty-Ball-Person-Carrier, you must not sacrifice them. You must instead take them to the volcano and give them the Eye of Splod. And this shall be the way that you shall know them. The human being will hold up some milk.""
""Is that the prophecy?"" said the voice.
""Yes.""
""Is there anything about crops in it?""
""I'm afraid not.""
""Oh well. Thank you anyway, prophetic and mysterious voices from the air.""
I pressed the red button.
Daylight. We were in the middle of a very familiar volcanic eruption. ""Quickly!"" I said. ""Give me the emerald!""


A little way away I could see a balloon being blown through the sky, while fire and ash were swept around it by the wind. I could see me in the balloon, standing next to Professor Steg, with my mouth open. I looked miserable.
Professor Steg-MY Professor Steg-gave me the emerald.


I raced down the rope ladder and placed the emerald back into the face's eye. Then, as the volcano stopped erupting, I looked around for the milk. I knew it had landed on Splod's head when it fell.
Fortunately, the milk had fallen into a small drift of volcanic ash, and was unharmed. I picked it up, brushed it off, and started back up the balloon ladder. Professor Steg pressed the button.
The sky went dark.

We were FLOATING above a landscape of ominous towers and disquieting castles. It was not a friendly place. Bats flew across the sky in huge flocks, crowding out the waning moon.
""I don't like this place,"" I told the professor.
""I don't see why not,"" he said. ""It looks as if it would be very nice when the sun comes up.""
There was a loud FLUT!, and where the bats had been fluttering, several pallid people were now standing. The man in front had a very bald head.
THEY ALL HAD SHARP TEETH.


""Ve are wumpires,"" they said. ""Vot is this? Who are you? Answer us, or ve vill wiwisect you.""
""I am Professor Steg,"" boomed the Stegosaurus. ""This is my assistant. We are on an important mission. I am trying to get back to the present. My assistant is trying to get home to the future for breakfast.""
At the word BREAKFAST all the wumpires looked very excited.
""Ve have not had our breakfast,"" they told us. ""Ve normally have vigglyvorms, vith orange juice on them. Orange juice makes vorms ewen vigglier. Like vandering spaghetti. But if ve cannot eat vorms ve vill eat assistant, or ewen roast professor.""

One of the wumpires took out a fork, and looked me up and down in a hungry sort of way.
The baldest, most bulging-eyed, rattiest of the wumpires said, ""Vot is this box?""
""It is my finest invention,"" began Professor Steg proudly, but I interrupted.

""It is to keep sandwiches in,"" I said.
""Sandviches?"" said the wumpire.

""Sandwiches,"" I said, with as much certainty as I could muster.
""Ve thought it vos a Time Machine,"" said the head wumpire, with a sly, sharp smile. ""And ve could use it to inwade the vorld!""
""Definitely sandwiches,"" I told him.
""Vot happens if I press this button, then?"" asked a lady wumpire. She had long black hair that covered most of her face, and peered out at the world with one suspicious eye.
She pressed the button. We went forward six hours in time.
""See?"" said the professor happily. ""All this place needs to brighten it up is a little bit of sunshine.""


The head wumpire said, ""Vot?"" and dissolved into a cloud of oily black smoke. So did all his friends.
""Yes,"" I said. ""It is a nice place here, after all. In the daylight.""
The professor tinkered with the jewels and the string and the buttons. Then he said, ""I think I've got it properly fine-tuned, now. This next press should bring you back to your own time, place, and breakfast.""
But before the tip of his tail could touch the button, a voice said, ""I'll explain later. Fate of the world at stake.""
A hand grabbed, and the milk, which I had carried safely for so long, was gone. I turned in time to catch a glimpse of a fine-looking gentleman with his back to me, holding my milk, and then the hole in space through which he had reached was closed.
""MY MILK!""
""He said he'd explain later,"" said the professor. ""I'd be inclined to believe him.""

The hole in space opened again. A voice shouted, ""Catch!"" and the milk came rocketing through.
Fortunately, the milk struck me in the stomach, and in clutching my hands to my belly I caught the milk.

""There,"" said the professor. ""Everything is back to normal.""
""He did say he'd explain later,"" I pointed out. ""And that wasn't much of an explanation.""
""But it's not later yet,"" said Professor Steg. ""It's still now. It won't be later until later.""
He was arranging pebbles and stones and string on the top of the Time Machine box. ""Final coordinates entered,"" he said. ""And then it's off to your house for breakfast.""
""Does that mean that there is a Stegosaurus in a hot air balloon outside?"" I asked my dad.

""There is not,"" he said. ""For reasons that will become apparent.""
""I think that there should have been some nice wumpires,"" said my sister, wistfully. ""Nice, handsome, misunderstood wumpires.""
""There were not,"" said my father.
FTM_ch7	FTM	Fortunately, the Milk	7	689	3915	""Would you like to press the button?"" said Professor Steg.
I pressed the red button. There was an ear-popping noise and a flicker of years and I was floating, in a balloon basket, above the intersection of Marshall Road and Fletcher Lane. I could see our house from above. I could see the bicycles in the back garden. I could see the rabbit hutch.
""We're here!"" I said, and I patted Professor Steg on the back ridge-plates.
""It was very nice, having you as a traveling compani-aargh,"" said the professor, because there was a familiar sort of a thumm-thumm noise, and before I had a chance to press the red button, we were deposited, balloon and all, on the enormous metal deck of a flying saucer, with a number of very grumpy-looking green globby people staring at us with too many eyes. They did not look pleased.


""HaHA!"" said several globby people at the same time. ""You thought you had escaped us! And you were wrong! Now, you must sign the planet over to us so that we can remodel it. We will take out all the trees, for a start, and put in plastic flamingoes.""
""Why?""
""We like plastic flamingoes. We think they are the highest and finest art form that Earth has achieved. And they are tidier than trees.""


""Also, we are going to replace the clouds with scented candles.""
""We like scented candles, too,"" explained a huge green globby person, who looked like he was mostly made of snot.
""We also like decorative plates!"" said another. ""We will put a decorative plate up where the moon is now.""
""A really BIG decorative plate, showing landmarks of the world.""


""And we will then replace all of the landmarks of the world with decorative plates with pictures of landmarks on them too, so the Eiffel Tower will be replaced by a large plate with a picture of the Eiffel Tower on it. And Australia will be replaced by a really seriously big plate with Australia on it.""

""Also we will replace all of your mountains with throw-cushions,"" said the smallest, globbiest thing of all, with triumph in its glutinous voice.


""We have learned a lot from our previous meeting,"" said some globs that were sticking to a wall. ""If you look over there, you will see that the door to the space-time continuum you used to escape through last time is now securely locked.""

It was definitely locked. It had a huge padlock on it, and a sign saying
KEEP OUT
on it, in unfriendly red letters. There were also chains around it, a tape that said
DO NOT CROSS,
and a handwritten notice that said
For Your Convenience,Please Use Another Door.
ESCAPE WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

""Also we have depowered your Time Machine.""
I looked at the professor. His armored back-flaps were drooping, and his tail was-well, not actually between his legs, because stegosauruses aren't made that way, but if they were, it would have been.
""We have been tracking your movements through time and space,"" said a large globby alien in front of a console with a screen on it.
""Now, see what happens when I press this grundledorfer,"" said a particularly drippy alien. It was half-sticking to the wall, next to a large black, shiny button.
""It's called a button,"" I said.
""Nonsense. We named it after our brood-aunt, Nessie Grundledorfer,"" said the globby aliens. The particularly drippy alien pressed the black button on the metal wall with something that might have been a finger and might just have been a long strand of snot.

There was a CRACKLE.
There was a FIZZ.
Standing around us, in attitudes of anger and irritation, were several pirates, some of the black-haired people from the jungle, a very unhappy-looking volcano god, a large bowl filled with piranhas, and some wumpires.





""I'm not sure that I understand what the piranhas are doing,"" said my sister.

""They were from a narrow escape earlier that I forgot to mention,"" said our father. ""Fortunately, the milk floated at a crucial moment and it all ended for the best.""
""I thought it might,"" I said.
FTM_ch8	FTM	Fortunately, the Milk	8	1987	11211	""Uh-oh,"" I said.
""Prepare to be keelhauled, you scurvy dogs,"" shouted the pirates.
""Let us now sacrifice them both to great Splod!"" shouted the men with shiny black hair.
""They stole my eye! Twice!"" rumbled mighty Splod.
""Ve vants those willains and warmints wiolently vound up,"" proclaimed a tall lady wumpire with long fingernails.
The piranhas said nothing, but they thrashed about in their bowl, ominously.



""Doomed,"" moaned Professor Steg. ""We cannot escape. They have frozen us in time and depowered us. Even my mighty Time Machine can do no more than open a small window in time and space-smaller than either of us could get through.""
""But can you do it?"" I asked. ""Open a little window in time to our last location?""
""Of course. But what good would that do?""
""Quickly!"" I said. ""Do it!""
Professor Steg pushed the button on the box with the tip of his nose.
There was a zum! and a plip! and a window opened in space and time, large enough for an arm to get through.
I reached into it.

""I'll explain later,"" I said. ""Fate of the world at stake."" I grabbed the milk from me, fifteen minutes earlier, through the tiny space-time portal.
""You must like milk a lot,"" said the globby aliens. ""But that craving for lactic liquids will not make us take pity on you or let you go and spare your badly-designed planet.""
""It should,"" I said. ""What am I holding in my left hand?""
""Er. The milk,"" they said.
""And what am I holding in my right hand?""

They paused. Then one alien, so green and small and so globby and crusted that he might have been an enormous snot-bubble blown by an elephant with a terrible head-cold, said, "". . . the same milk from fifteen minutes earlier.""


""Exactly,"" I said. ""Now. Think about this one very carefully. What would happen if I touched these two things together?""
The globby aliens went a very pale green. The pirates, shiny-black-hair-men, and the piranhas looked at them, puzzled, seeking some kind of explanation, as did the wumpires.
""If two things that are the same thing touch,"" proclaimed the volcano god, ""then the whole Universe shall end. Thus sayeth the great and unutterable Splod.""

""How does a volcano know so much about transtemporal meta-science?"" asked one of the pale green aliens.


""Being a geological formation gives you a lot of time to think,"" said Splod. ""Also, I subscribe to a number of learned journals.""
I coughed, in what I hoped was an ominous sort of way. ""Well?"" I asked.
""What he said,"" admitted the green globby aliens. ""The bit about the Universe ending.""
""So,"" I told them. ""Unless you wish to spend the rest of your lives in a universe that no longer exists, you had better return things to the way they were. And then go away.""

The aliens looked at each other. They grinned at each other.
One of them pressed the grundledorfer.


The wumpires, pirates, piranhas, volcano god, and the worshippers of the volcano god were gone.
""What if,"" suggested one of the green globby aliens hopefully, ""we only redecorated the Southern Hemisphere?""
""Not a chance,"" I said. ""Now, release us, or the milk touches itself! And then go away. Leave this planet forever.""
The aliens looked at me, then they looked at each other, and then they sighed, with a noise like a hundred elephantine snot balloons all deflating at once.
""Right,"" they said.
It was at that moment that a voice louder than anything I have ever heard-and I had heard a volcano erupt at very close range-said,
""GALACTIC POLICE. DO NOT MOVE.""
My hands shook, but the milk did not touch the milk, and the Universe did not end.
There were red and blue flashing lights and then, stepping off their space-bikes, were about half a dozen uniformed dinosaurs, holding unmistakably large and extremely serious weapons. They pointed their weapons at the green globby aliens.
""You are charged with breaking into people's planets and redecorating them,"" said a noble and imposing-looking Tyrannosaurus Rex. ""And then with running away and doing it again somewhere else, over and over. You have committed crimes against the inhabitants of eighteen planets, and crimes against good taste.""
""What we did to Rigel Four was art!"" argued a globby alien.
""Art? There are people on Rigel Four,"" said an Ankylosaurus, ""who have to look up, every night, at a moon with three huge plaster ducks flying across it.""
Something very long with a head on the end of it came over to us. It was attached to a very large body, on the other side of the room. ""Who are you?"" it asked Professor Steg. ""And why is your gorilla holding a transtemporally dislocated milk container?""
""I am not a gorilla,"" I said. ""I am a human father.""



""The human is holding the milk in order to make these evil redecorating snot-bubbles go away and stop menacing this planet and us,"" said Professor Steg.
The Diplodocus in a police cap opened its mouth and didn't say anything.
The Tyrannosaurus, who had handcuffed all of the green globby people together with something that looked a lot more like pink string-in-a-can than it looked like handcuffs, which was a good thing because they probably didn't have hands and they definitely didn't have wrists, stared at us and his eyes opened wide.
""Great day in the morning!"" he exclaimed. ""A biped. A Stegosaurus. A Floaty-Ball-Person-Carrier. . . ."" And he stopped, as if unable to go on.



A Pteranodon flapped over to us, then landed at Professor Steg's feet. It looked up at him, and said, hesitantly, ""Would you be . . . ? Could you be...? The inventor of Professor Steg's Pointy Zooming-into-Outer-Space-Machine? Of Professor Steg's Really Good Moves Around in Time Machine? Would you be the author of My Travels into the Extremely Far Future and What I Found There? Professor Steg, wisest of all dinosaur-kind? MADAM, IS IT TRULY YOU?""
""It is,"" said the Professor. (Madam? I thought, embarrassed.) ""And this is my assistant.""
The Pteranodon extended a wing tip for me to shake, and without thinking, I moved the second milk from my right hand to my left . . .
Where the first milk was.
EVERYBODY GASPED.



Unfortunately, the milk that had been in my right hand, which was the same as the milk that was already in my left hand, the same milk fifteen minutes apart, touched each other.
I held my breath.
There was a fizzing noise, and a mewing as if a hundred kittens were being agitated in an enormous basket.
Professor Steg closed her eyes. ""I can't look,"" she said.
Three purple dwarfs with flowerpots on their heads appeared from nowhere and began to do a little dance.
""Did the Universe end?"" said the Tyrannosaurus, with his eyes tightly scrunched closed.
""LOOK!"" I SAID.

We all watched the dwarfs dance. They weren't human and they weren't dinosaurs. They had purple skin and the flowerpots on their heads had lots of flowers growing out of them. They did a complicated sort of a dance, with lots of leg kicking and shouts of ""OY!"" and ""OLAY!"" and ""PERTUNG!"" And then, as strangely as they had come, they vanished.
""Ah,"" said Professor Steg. ""It was always a possibility that this might happen. And fortunately, the Universe has not ended.""
She pressed the button again, with her tail. A small hole in space and time opened up. I was standing on the other side with a baffled expression on my face.
""Catch!"" I shouted, and threw the milk through the hole. As the portal closed, I saw me catch the milk using my stomach.
The green globby aliens having been rounded up and taken away, all the space-dinosaurs gathered around.
""I can't believe it,"" said the Diplodocus. ""Professor Steg. Just like in the comics. The dinosaur who taught us that in the far future, small mammals will eat their breakfast cereal with milk on it. Inventor of the button. She's here, in front of us, with her gorilla.""


""Not a gorilla, but a human father,"" said Professor Steg, and all the other dinosaurs gasped and said things like ""How wise she is!"" and ""What a brain!"" and ""How can you tell the difference between that creature and a gorilla? Is it the shoes?""
Professor Steg said, ""This human father has been my companion on my strange journey into the future. Now, before I take my leave of him, and come with you, O Space Dinosaurs, we should sing to him one of the great old dinosaur songs.""


They sang me a song in six-part harmony called ""How Do You Feel This Morning When You Know What You Did Last Night?"" Then they sang me a song called ""Don't Go Down to the Tar Pits, Dear, Because I'm Getting Stuck on You."" The Space Police dinosaurs sang me a song about being Space Police and saving people all over the Universe, and driving very fast space-bikes. And then they all sang a song called ""I've Got a Loverly Bunch of Hard-hairy-wet-white-crunchers,"" which was an ancient dinosaur song that had apparently been written by Professor Steg's Aunt Button.
There is nothing in the whole of creation as beautiful as dinosaurs singing in harmony.

""Now,"" said Professor Steg. ""I shall go off in my Floaty-Ball-Person-Carrier, with my newfound Dinosaur Space Police friends, and I shall explore the Universe, and then I shall return to my own time, and write a book about it.""
""You actually write several books,"" said the Diplodocus. ""Professor Steg's Guide To Everything In The Whole Of The Future was my favorite. It's very inspirational.""

I said good-bye to all the dinosaurs. I thanked Professor Steg for saving my life.
""Not at all,"" she said. ""We were both fortunate that you had the milk with you. It is not every container of milk that saves the world, after all.""
""That was me that saved the world,"" I said. ""Not the milk.""

The space dinosaurs all had their pictures taken holding the milk and smiling at the camera.
""What are you going to do with the milk?"" they asked me. ""Are you going to put it in a museum?""
""No, I am not,"" I told them. ""I am going to give it to my children for their breakfast cereal. And possibly I will pour some in my tea.""
Professor Steg nipped back up the rope ladder and climbed into the gondola of her balloon. The last I saw of her-of any of them-the whole inside of the saucer was fading into light so bright I had to close my eyes and look away.
And then I was standing at the back door of our house, none the worse for wear. Fortunately, the dinosaurs had given me back the milk after they had their photos taken with it.
So I came in.
And here I am.






That was what my dad said.
I looked at my sister and my sister looked at me.
Then we both looked around the kitchen. At the calendar on the wall with the hot air balloons on it. At my dinosaur models and my sister's ponies, at my sister's vampire books, at the picture of a volcano I had painted when I was little, last year, and which is still up on the wall by the fridge.
We looked at those things, and we looked at my dad.
""You know, we don't believe any of this,"" said my sister.
""We don't,"" I told him. ""Not any of it.""
""Especially not how you saved the world from being remodeled. Or the pirates.""




""Not. Any. Of. It,"" I said.
My father shrugged. ""Suit yourselves,"" he said. ""But it was all true. And I can prove it.""
""How?""
""Yes. How?"" asked my little sister.
""Well,"" said my father, putting it down on the kitchen table, ""here's the MILK.""


AND HE WENT BACK TO READING HIS PAPER.
NW_ch0	NW	Neverwhere	0	1246	7170	NeverwhereI have never been to St. John's Wood. I dare not.

He sat on the sidewalk and held on tightly to the rolled-up umbrella, and wondered whether going south to London was really a good idea.""You want to keep a eye out,"" said a cracked old voice. ""They'll be moving you on before you can say Jack Robinson. Or taking you in, I wouldn't be surprised."" Two sharp eyes stared out from a beaky, grimy face. ""You all right?""""Yes, thank you,"" said Richard. He was a fresh-faced, boyish young man, with dark, slightly curly hair and large hazel eyes; he had a rumpled, just-woken-up look to him, which made him more attractive to the opposite sex than he would ever understand or believe.The grimy face softened. ""Here, poor thing,"" she said, and pushed a fifty-pence piece into Richard's hand. "" 'Ow long you been on the streets, then?""""I'm not homeless,"" explained Richard, embarrassed, attempting to give the old woman her coin back. ""Please-take your money. I'm fine. I just came out here to get some air. I go to London tomorrow,"" he added.She peered down at him suspiciously, then took back her fifty pence and made it vanish beneath the layers of coats and shawls in which she was enveloped. ""I've been to London,"" she confided. ""I was married in London. But he was a bad lot. Me mam told me not to go marrying outside, but I was young and beautiful, although you'd never credit it today, and I followed my heart.""""I'm sure you did,"" said Richard. The conviction that he was about to be sick was starting, slowly, to fade.""Fat lot of good it done me. I been homeless, so I know what it's like,"" said the old woman. ""That's why I thought you was. What you going to London for?""""I've got a job,"" he told her proudly.""Doing what?"" she asked.""Um, Securities,"" said Richard.""I was a dancer,"" said the old woman, and she tottered awkwardly around the sidewalk, humming tunelessly to herself. Then she teetered from side to side like a spinning top coming to rest, and finally she stopped, facing Richard. ""Hold out your hand,"" she told him, ""and I'll tell yer fortune."" He did as he was told. She put her old hand into his, and held it tightly, and then she blinked a few times, like an owl who had swallowed a mouse that was beginning to disagree with it. ""You got a long way to go . . . "" she said, puzzled.""London,"" Richard told her.""Not just London . . . "" The old woman paused. ""Not any London I know."" It started to rain then, softly. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""It starts with doors.""""Doors?""She nodded. The rain fell harder, pattering on the roofs and on the asphalt of the road. ""I'd watch out for doors if I were you.""Richard stood up, a little unsteadily. ""All right,"" he said, a little unsure of how he ought to treat information of this nature. ""I will. Thanks.""The pub door was opened, and light and noise spilled out into the street. ""Richard? You all right?""""Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be back in a second."" The old lady was already wobbling down the street, into the pelting rain, getting wet. Richard felt he had to do something for her: he couldn't give her money, though. He hurried after her, down the narrow street, the cold rain drenching his face and hair. ""Here,"" said Richard. He fumbled with the handle of the umbrella, trying to find the button that opened it. Then a click, and it blossomed into a huge white map of the London Underground network, each line drawn in a different color, every station marked and named.The old woman took the umbrella, gratefully, and smiled her thanks. ""You've a good heart,"" she told him. ""Sometimes that's enough to see. you safe wherever you go."" Then she shook her head. ""But mostly, it's not."" She clutched the umbrella tightly as a gust of wind threatened to tug it away from her or pull it inside out. She wrapped her arms around it and bent almost double against the rain and the wind. Then she walked away into the rain and the night, a round white shape covered with the names of London Tube stations-Earl's Court, Marble Arch, Blackfriars, White City, Victoria, Angel, Oxford Circus . . .Richard found himself pondering, drunkenly, whether there really was a circus at Oxford Circus: a real circus with clowns, beautiful women, and dangerous beasts. The pub door opened once more: a blast of sound, as if the pub's volume control had just been turned up high. ""Richard, you idiot, it's your bloody party, and you're missing all the fun."" He walked back in the pub, the urge to be sick lost in all the oddness.""You look like a drowned rat,"" said someone.""You've never seen a drowned rat,"" said Richard.Someone else handed him a large whisky. ""Here, get that down you. That'll warm you up. You know, you won't be able to get real Scotch in London.""""I'm sure I will,"" sighed Richard. Water was dripping from his hair into his drink. ""They have everything in London."" And he downed the Scotch, and after that someone bought him another, and then the evening blurred and broke up into fragments: afterward he remembered only the feeling that he was about to leave somewhere small and rational-a place that made sense-for somewhere huge and old that didn't; and vomiting interminably into a gutter flowing with rainwater, somewhere in the small hours of the morning; and a white shape marked with strange-colored symbols, like a little round beetle, walking away from him in the rain.The next morning he boarded the train for the six-hour journey south that would bring him to the strange gothic spires and arches of St. Pancras Station. His mother gave him a small walnut cake that she had made for the journey and a thermos filled with tea; and Richard Mayhew went to London feeling like hell.
NW_ch1	NW	Neverwhere	1	5515	32132	NeverwhereONEShe had been running for four days now, a harum-scarum tumbling flight through passages and tunnels. She was hungry, and exhausted, and more tired than a body could stand, and each successive door was proving harder to open. After four days of flight, she had found a hiding place, a tiny stone burrow, under the world, where she would be safe, or so she prayed, and at last she slept.Mr. Croup had hired Ross at the last Floating Market, which had been held in Westminster Abbey. ""Think of him,"" he told Mr. Vandemar, ""as a canary.""""Sings?"" asked Mr. Vandemar.""I doubt it; I sincerely and utterly doubt it."" Mr. Croup ran a hand through his lank orange hair. ""No, my fine friend, I was thinking metaphorically-more along the lines of the birds they take down mines."" Mr. Vandemar nodded, comprehension dawning slowly: yes, a canary. Mr. Ross had no other resemblance to a canary. He was huge-almost as big as Mr. Vandemar-and extremely grubby, and quite hairless, and he said very little, although he had made a point of telling each of them that he liked to kill things, and he was good at it; and this amused Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar. But he was a canary, and he never knew it. So Mr. Ross went first, in his filthy T-shirt and his crusted blue-jeans, and Croup and Vandemar walked behind him, in their elegant black suits.There are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar apart: first, Mr. Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr. Croup; second, Mr. Croup has eyes of a faded china blue, while Mr. Vandemar's eyes are brown; third, while Mr. Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of four ravens, Mr. Croup has no obvious jewelery; fourth, Mr. Croup likes words, while Mr. Vandemar is always hungry. Also, they look nothing at all alike.A rustle in the tunnel darkness; Mr. Vandemar's knife was in his hand, and then it was no longer in his hand, and it was quivering gently almost thirty feet away. He walked over to his knife and picked it up by the hilt. There was a gray rat impaled on the blade, its mouth opening and closing impotently as the life fled. He crushed its skull between finger and thumb.""Now, there's one rat that won't be telling any more tales,"" said Mr. Croup. He chuckled at his own joke. Mr. Vandemar did not respond. ""Rat. Tales. Get it?""Mr. Vandemar pulled the rat from the blade and began to munch on it, thoughtfully, head first. Mr. Croup slapped it out of his hands. ""Stop that,"" he said. Mr. Vandemar put his knife away, a little sullenly. ""Buck up,"" hissed Mr. Croup, encouragingly. ""There will always be another rat. Now: onward. Things to do. People to damage.""Three years in London had not changed Richard, although it had changed the way he perceived the city. Richard had originally imagined London as a gray city, even a black city, from pictures he had seen, and he was surprised to find it filled with color. It was a city of red brick and white stone, red buses and large black taxis, bright red mailboxes and green grassy parks and cemeteries.It was a city in which the very old and the awkwardly new jostled each other, not uncomfortably, but without respect; a city of shops and offices and restaurants and homes, of parks and churches, of ignored monuments and remarkably unpalatial palaces; a city of hundreds of districts with strange names-Crouch End, Chalk Farm, Earl's Court, Marble Arch-and oddly distinct identities; a noisy, dirty, cheerful, troubled city, which fed on tourists, needed them as it despised them, in which the average speed of transportation through the city had not increased in three hundred years, following five hundred years of fitful road-widening and unskillful compromises between the needs of traffic, whether horse-drawn, or, more recently, motorized, and the needs of pedestrians; a city inhabited by and teeming with people of every color and manner and kind.When he had first arrived, he had found London huge, odd, fundamentally incomprehensible, with only the Tube map, that elegant multicolored topographical display of underground railway lines and stations, giving it any semblance of order. Gradually he realized that the Tube map was a handy fiction that made life easier but bore no resemblance to the reality of the shape of the city above. It was like belonging to a political party, he thought once, proudly, and then, having tried to explain the resemblance between the Tube map and politics, at a party, to a cluster of bewildered strangers, he had decided in the future to leave political comment to others.He continued, slowly, by a process of osmosis and white knowledge (which is like white noise, only more useful), to comprehend the city, a process that accelerated when he realized that the actual City of London itself was no bigger than a square mile, stretching from Aldgate in the east to Fleet Street and the law courts of the Old Bailey in the west, a tiny municipality, now home to London's financial institutions, and that that was where it had all begun.Two thousand years before, London had been a little Celtic village on the north shore of the Thames, which the Romans had encountered, then settled in. London had grown, slowly, until, roughly a thousand years later, it met the tiny Royal City of Westminster immediately to the west, and, once London Bridge had been built, London touched the town of Southwark directly across the river; and it continued to grow, fields and woods and marshland slowly vanishing beneath the flourishing town, and it continued to expand, encountering other little villages and hamlets as it grew, like Whitechapel and Dept-ford to the east, Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush to the west, Camden and Islington in the north, Battersea and Lambeth across the Thames to the south, absorbing all of them, just as a pool of mercury encounters and incorporates smaller beads of mercury, leaving only their names behind.London grew into something huge and contradictory. It was a good place, and a fine city, but there is a price to be paid for all good places, and a price that all good places have to pay.After a while, Richard found himself taking London for granted; in time, he began to pride himself on having visited none of the sights of London (except for the Tower of London, when his Aunt Maude came down to the city for a weekend, and Richard found himself her reluctant escort).But Jessica changed all that. Richard found himself, on otherwise sensible weekends, accompanying her to places like the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery, where he learned that walking around museums too long hurts your feet, that the great art treasures of the world all blur into each other after a while, and that it is almost beyond the human capacity for belief to accept how much museum cafeterias will brazenly charge for a slice of cake and a cup of tea.""Here's your tea and your éclair,"" he told her. ""It would have cost less to buy one of those Tintorettos.""""Don't exaggerate,"" said Jessica cheerfully. ""Anyway, there aren't any Tintorettos at the Tate.""""I should have had that cherry cake,"" said Richard. ""Then they would have been able to afford another Van Gogh.""Richard had met Jessica in France, on a weekend trip to Paris two years earlier; had in fact discovered her in the Louvre, trying to find the group of his office friends who had organized the trip. Staring up at an immense sculpture, he had stepped backwards into Jessica, who was admiring an extremely large and historically important diamond. He tried to apologize to her in French, which he did not speak, gave up, and began to apologize in English, then tried to apologize in French for having to apologize in English, until he noticed that Jessica was about as English as it was possible for any one person to be. By this time she decided he should buy her an expensive French sandwich and some overpriced carbonated apple juice, by way of apology, and, well, that was the start of it all, really. He had never been able to convince Jessica that he wasn't the kind of person who went to art galleries after that.On weekends when they did not go to art galleries or to museums, Richard would trail behind Jessica as she went shopping, which she did, on the whole, in affluent Knightsbridge, a short walk and an even shorter taxi ride from her apartment in a Kensington mews. Richard would accompany Jessica on her tours of such huge and intimidating emporia as Harrods and Harvey Nichols, stores where Jessica was able to purchase anything, from jewelry, to books, to the week's groceries.Richard had been awed by Jessica, who was beautiful, and often quite funny, and was certainly going somewhere. And Jessica saw in Richard an enormous amount of potential, which, properly harnessed by the right woman, would have made him the perfect matrimonial accessory. If only he were a little more focused, she would murmur to herself, and so she gave him books with titles like Dress for Success and A Hundred and Twenty-Five Habits of Successful Men, and books on how to run a business like a military campaign, and Richard always said thank you, and always intended to read them. In Harvey Nichols's men's fashion department she would pick out for him the kinds of clothes she thought that he should wear-and he wore them, during the week, anyway; and, a year to the day after their first encounter, she told him she thought it was time that they went shopping for an engagement ring.""Why do you go out with her?"" asked Gary, in Corporate Accounts, eighteen months later. ""She's terrifying.""Richard shook his head. ""She's really sweet, once you get to know her.""Gary put down the plastic troll doll he had picked up from Richard's desk. ""I'm surprised she still lets you play with these.""""The subject has never come up,"" said Richard, picking up one of the creatures from his desk. It had a shock of Day-Glo orange hair, and a slightly baffled expression, as if it were lost.And the subject had indeed come up. Jessica had, however, convinced herself that Richard's troll collection was a mark of endearing eccentricity, comparable to Mr. Stockton's collection of angels. Jessica was in the process of organizing a traveling exhibition of Mr. Stockton's angel collection, and she had come to the conclusion that great men always collected something. In actuality Richard did not really collect trolls. He had found a troll on the sidewalk outside the office, and, in a vain attempt at injecting a little personality into his working world, he had placed it on his computer monitor. The others had followed over the next few months, gifts from colleagues who had noticed that Richard had a penchant for the ugly little creatures. He had taken the gifts and positioned them, strategically, around his desk, beside the telephones and the framed photograph of Jessica.The photograph had a yellow Post-it note stuck to it.It was a Friday afternoon. Richard had noticed that events were cowards: they didn't occur singly, but instead they would run in packs and leap out at him all at once. Take this particular Friday, for example. It was, as Jessica had pointed out to him at least a dozen times in the last month, the most important day of his life. So it was unfortunate that, despite the Post-it note Richard had left on his fridge door at home, and the other Post-it note he had placed on the photograph of Jessica on his desk, he had forgotten about it completely and utterly.Also, there was the Wandsworth report, which was overdue and taking up most of his head. Richard checked another row of figures; then he noticed that page 17 had vanished, and he set it up to print out again; and another page down, and he knew that if he were only left alone to finish it . . . if, miracle of miracles, the phone did not ring . . . It rang. He thumbed the speakerphone.""Hello? Richard? The managing director needs to know when he'll have the report.""Richard looked at his watch. ""Five minutes, Sylvia. It's almost wrapped up. I just have to attach the P & L projection.""""Thanks, Dick. I'll come down for it."" Sylvia was, as she liked to explain, ""the MD's PA,"" and she moved in an atmosphere of crisp efficiency. He thumbed the speakerphone off; it rang again, immediately. ""Richard,"" said the speaker, with Jessica's voice, ""it's Jessica. You haven't forgotten, have you?""""Forgotten?"" He tried to remember what he could have forgotten. He looked at Jessica's photograph for inspiration and found all the inspiration he could have needed in the shape of a yellow Post-it note stuck to her forehead.""Richard? Pick up the telephone.""He picked up the phone, reading the Post-it note as he did so. ""Sorry, Jess. No, I hadn't forgotten. Seven P.M., at Ma Maison Italiano. Should I meet you there?""""Jessica, Richard. Not Jess."" She paused for a moment. ""After what happened last time? I don't think so. You really could get lost in your own backyard, Richard.""Richard thought about pointing out that anyone could have confused the National Gallery with the National Portrait Gallery, and that it wasn't she who had spent the whole day standing in the rain (which was, in his opinion, every bit as much fun as walking around either place until his feet hurt), but he thought better of it.""I'll meet you at your place,"" said Jessica. ""We can walk down together.""""Right, Jess. Jessica-sorry.""""You have confirmed our reservation, haven't you, Richard.""""Yes,"" lied Richard earnestly. The other line on his phone had begun to ring. ""Jessica, look, I . . . """"Good,"" said Jessica, and she broke the connection. He picked up the other line.""Hi Dick. It's me, Gary."" Gary sat a few desks down from Richard. He waved. ""Are we still on for drinks? You said we could go over the Merstham account.""""Get off the bloody phone, Gary. Of course we are."" Richard put down the phone. There was a telephone number at the bottom of the Post-it note; Richard had written the Post-it note to himself, several weeks earlier. And he had made the reservation: he was almost certain of that. But he had not confirmed it. He had kept meaning to, but there had been so much to do and Richard had known that there was plenty of time. But events run in packs . . .Sylvia was now standing next to him. ""Dick? The Wandsworth report?""""Almost ready, Sylvia. Look, just hold on a sec, can you?""He finished punching in the number, breathed a sigh of relief when somebody answered, ""Ma Maison. Can I help you?""""Yes,"" said Richard. ""A table for three, for tonight. I think I booked it. And if I did I'm confirming the reservation. And if I didn't, I wondered if I could book it. Please."" No, they had no record of a table for tonight in the name of Mayhew. Or Stockton. Or Bartram-Jessica's surname. And as for booking a table . . .It wasn't the words that Richard found so unpleasant: it was the tone of voice in which the information was transmitted. A table for tonight should certainly have been booked years before-perhaps, it was implied, by Richard's parents. A table for tonight was impossible: if the pope, the prime minister, and the president of France arrived this evening without a confirmed reservation, even they would be turned out into the street with a continental jeer. ""But it's for my fiancee's boss. I know I should have phoned before. There are only three of us, can't you please . . . ""They had put down the phone.""Richard?"" said Sylvia. ""The MD's waiting.""""Do you think,"" asked Richard, ""they'd give me a table if I phoned back and offered them extra money?""In her dream they were all together in the house. Her parents, her brother, her baby sister. They were standing together in the ballroom, staring at her. They were all so pale, so grave. Portia, her mother, touched her cheek and told her that she was in danger. In her dream, Door laughed, and said she knew. Her mother shook her head: no, no-now she was in danger. Now.Door opened her eyes. The door was opening, quietly, quietly; she held her breath. Footsteps, quiet on the stone. Perhaps he won't notice me, she thought. Perhaps he'll go away. And then she thought, desperately, I'm hungry.The footsteps hesitated. She was well hidden, she knew, under a pile of newspapers and rags. And it was possible that the intruder meant her no harm. Can't he hear my heartbeat? she thought. And then the footsteps came closer, and she knew what she had to do, and it scared her. A hand pulled the covers off her, and she looked up into a blank, utterly hairless face, which creased into a vicious smile. She rolled, then, and twisted, and the knife blade, aimed at her chest, caught her in the upper arm.Until that moment, she had never thought she could do it. Never thought she would be brave enough, or scared enough, or desperate enough to dare. But she reached up one hand to his chest, and she opened . . .He gasped, and tumbled onto her. It was wet and warm and slippery, and she slithered and staggered out from under the man, and she stumbled out of the room.She caught her breath in the tunnel outside, narrow and low, as she fell against the wall, breathing in gasps and sobs. That had taken the last of her strength; now she was spent. Her shoulder was beginning to throb. The knife, she thought. But she was safe.""My, oh my,"" said a voice from the darkness on her right. ""She survived Mister Ross. Well I never, Mister Vandemar."" The voice oozed. It sounded like gray slime.""Well I never either, Mister Croup,"" said a flat voice on her left.A light was kindled and flickered. ""Still,"" said Mr. Croup, his eyes gleaming in the dark beneath the earth, ""she won't survive us.""Door kneed him, hard, in the groin: and then she pushed herself forward, her right hand holding her left shoulder.And she ran.""Dick?""Richard waved away the interruption. Life was almost under his control, now. Just a little more time . . .Gary said his name again. ""Dick? It's six-thirty.""""It's what?"" Papers and pens and spreadsheets and trolls were tumbled into Richard's briefcase. He snapped it shut and ran.He pulled his coat on as he went. Gary was following. ""Are we going to have that drink, then?""Richard paused for a moment. If ever, he decided, they made disorganization an Olympic sport, he could be disorganized for Britain. ""Gary,"" he said, ""I'm sorry. I blew it. I have to see Jessica tonight. We're taking her boss out to dinner.""""Mister Stockton? Of Stocktons? The Stockton?"" Richard nodded. They hurried down the stairs. ""I'm sure you'll have fun,"" said Gary, insincerely. ""And how is the Creature from the Black Lagoon?""""Jessica's from Ilford, actually, Gary. And she remains the light and love of my life, thank you very much for asking."" They reached the lobby, and Richard made a dash for the automatic doors, which spectacularly failed to open.""It's after six, Mister Mayhew,"" said Mr. Figgis, the building's security guard. ""You have to sign out.""""I don't need this,"" said Richard to no one in particular, ""I really don't.""Mr. Figgis smelled vaguely of medicinal liniment and was widely rumored to have an encyclopedic collection of soft-core pornography. He guarded the doors with a diligence that bordered upon madness, never quite having lived down the evening when an entire floor's worth of computer equipment upped and left, along with two potted palms and the managing director's Axminster carpet.""So our drink's off, then?""""I'm sorry, Gary. Is Monday okay for you?""""Sure. Monday's fine. See you Monday.""Mr. Figgis inspected their signatures and satisfied himself they had no computers, potted palms, or carpets about their persons, then he pressed a button under his desk, and the door slid open.""Doors,"" said Richard.The underway branched and divided; she picked her way at random, ducking through tunnels, running and stumbling and weaving. Behind her strolled Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, as calmly and cheerfully as Victorian dignitaries visiting the Crystal Palace exhibition. When they arrived at a crossroads, Mr. Croup would kneel and find the nearest spot of blood, and they would follow it. They were like hyenas, exhausting their prey. They could wait. They had all the time in the world.Luck was with Richard, for a change. He caught a black taxi, driven by an elderly man who took Richard home by an unlikely route involving streets Richard had never before seen, while holding forth, as Richard had discovered all London taxi drivers will hold forth-given a living, breathing, English-speaking passenger-on London's inner-city traffic problems, how best to deal with crime, and thorny political issues of the day. Richard jumped out of the cab, left a tip and his briefcase behind, managed to flag down the cab again before it made it into the main road and so got his briefcase back, then he ran up the stairs and into his apartment. He was already shedding clothes as he entered the hall: his briefcase spun across the room and crash-landed on the sofa; he took his keys from his pocket and placed them carefully on the hall table, in order to ensure he did not forget them.Then he dashed into the bedroom. The buzzer sounded. Richard, three-quarters of the way into his best suit, launched himself at the speaker.""Richard? It's Jessica. I hope you're ready.""""Oh. Yes. Be right, down."" He pulled on a coat, and he ran, slamming the door behind him. Jessica was waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs. She always waited for him there. Jessica didn't like Richard's apartment: it made her feel uncomfortably female. There was always the chance of finding a pair of Richard's underwear, well, anywhere, not to mention the wandering lumps of congealed toothpaste on the bathroom sink: no, it was not Jessica's kind of place.Jessica was very beautiful; so much so Richard would occasionally find himself staring at her, wondering, how did she end up with me? And when they made love-which they did at Jessica's apartment in fashionable Kensington, in Jessica's brass bed with the crisp white linen sheets (for Jessica's parents had told her that down comforters were decadent)-in the darkness, afterwards, she would hold him very tightly, and her long brown curls would tumble over his chest, and she would whisper to him how much she loved him, and he would tell her he loved her and always wanted to be with her, and they both believed it to be true.""Bless me, Mister Vandemar. She's slowing up.""""Slowing up, Mister Croup.""""She must be losing a lot of blood, Mister V.""""Lovely blood, Mister C. Lovely wet blood,""""Not long now.""A click: the sound of a switchblade opening, empty and lonely and dark.""Richard? What are you doing?"" asked Jessica.""Nothing, Jessica.""""You haven't forgotten your keys again, have you?""""No, Jessica."" Richard stopped patting himself and pushed his hands deep into the pockets of his coat.""Now, when you meet Mister Stockton tonight,"" said Jessica, ""you have to appreciate that he's not just a very important man. He's also a corporate entity in his own right.""""I can't wait,"" sighed Richard.""What was that, Richard?""""I can't wait,"" said Richard, rather more enthusiastically.""Oh, please hurry up,"" said Jessica, who was beginning to exude an aura of what, in a lesser woman, might almost have been described as nerves. ""We mustn't keep Mister Stockton waiting.""""No, Jess.""""Don't call me that, Richard. I loathe pet names. They're so demeaning.""""Spare any change?"" The man sat in a doorway. His beard was yellow and gray, and his eyes were sunken and dark. A hand-lettered sign hung from a piece of frayed string around his neck and rested on his chest, telling anyone with the eyes to read it that he was homeless and hungry. It didn't take a sign to tell you that; Richard, hand already in his pocket, fumbled for a coin.""Richard. We haven't got the time,"" said Jessica, who gave to charity and invested ethically. ""Now, I do want you to make a good impression, fiance-wise. It is vital that a future spouse makes a good impression."" And then her face creased, and she hugged him for a moment, and said, ""Oh, Richard. I do love you. You do know that, don't you?""And Richard nodded, and he did.Jessica checked her watch and increased her pace. Richard discreetly flicked a pound coin back through the air toward the man in the doorway, who caught it in one grimy hand.""There wasn't any problem with the reservations, was there?"" asked Jessica. And Richard, who was not much good at lying when faced with a direct question, said, ""Ah.""She had chosen wrongly-the corridor ended in a blank wall. Normally that would hardly have given her pause, but she was so tired, so hungry, in so much pain . . . She leaned against the wall, feeling the brick's roughness against her face. She was gulping breath, hiccuping and sobbing. Her arm was cold, and her left hand was numb. She could go no farther, and the world was beginning to feel very distant. She wanted to stop, to lie down, and to sleep for a hundred years.""Oh, bless my little black soul, Mister Vandemar, do you see what I see?"" The voice was soft, close: they must have been nearer to her than she had imagined. ""I spy, with my little eye, something that's going to be-""""Dead in a minute, Mister Croup,"" said the flat voice, from above her.""Our principal will be delighted.""And the girl pulled whatever she could find deep inside her soul, from all the pain, and the hurt, and the fear. She was spent, burnt out, and utterly exhausted. She had nowhere to go, no power left, no time. ""If it's the last door I open,"" she prayed, silently, to the Temple, to the Arch. ""Somewhere . . . anywhere . . . safe . . . "" and then she thought, wildly, ""Somebody.""And, as she began to pass out, she tried to open a door.As the darkness took her, she heard Mr. Croup's voice, as if from a long way away. It said, ""Bugger and blast.""Jessica and Richard walked down the sidewalk toward the restaurant. She had her arm through his, and was walking as fast as her heels permitted. He hurried to keep up. Streetlights and the fronts of closed stores illuminated their path. They passed a stretch of tall, looming buildings, abandoned and lonely, bounded by a high brick wall.""You are honestly telling me you had to promise them an extra fifty pounds for our table tonight? You are an idiot, Richard,"" said Jessica, her dark eyes flashing.""They had lost my reservation. And they said all the tables were booked."" Their steps echoed off the high walls.""They'll probably have us sitting by the kitchen,"" said Jessica. ""Or the door. Did you tell them it was for Mister Stockton?""""Yes,"" replied Richard.Jessica sighed. She continued to drag him along, as a door opened in the wall, a little way ahead of them. Someone stepped out and stood swaying for one long terrible moment, and then collapsed to the concrete. Richard shivered and stopped in his tracks. Jessica tugged him into motion.""Now, when you're talking to Mister Stockton, you must make sure you don't interrupt him. Or disagree with him-he doesn't like to be disagreed with. When he makes a joke, laugh. If you're in any doubt as to whether or not he's made a joke, look at me. I'll . . . mm, tap my forefinger.""They had reached the person on the sidewalk. Jessica stepped over the crumpled form. Richard hesitated. ""Jessica?""""You're right. He might think I'm bored,"" she mused. ""I know,"" she said brightly, ""if he makes a joke, I'll rub my earlobe.""""Jessica?"" He could hot believe that she was simply ignoring the figure at their feet.""What?"" She was not pleased to be jerked out of her reverie.""Look.""He pointed to the sidewalk. The person was face down, and enveloped in bulky clothes; Jessica took his arm and tugged him toward her. ""Oh. I see. If you pay them any attention, Richard, they'll walk all over you. They all have homes, really. Once she's slept it off, I'm sure she'll be fine."" She? Richard looked down. It was a girl. Jessica continued, ""Now, I've told Mister Stockton that we . . . "" Richard was down on one knee. ""Richard? What are you doing?""""She isn't drunk,"" said Richard. ""She's hurt."" He looked at his fingertips. ""She's bleeding.""Jessica looked down at him, nervous and puzzled. ""We're going to be late,"" she pointed out.""She's hurt.""Jessica looked back at the girl on the sidewalk. Priorities: Richard had no priorities. ""Richard. We're going to be late. Someone else will be along; someone else will help her.""The girl's face was crusted with dirt, and her clothes were wet with blood. ""She's hurt,"" he said, simply. There was an expression on his face that Jessica hadn't seen before.""Richard,"" she warned, and then she relented, a little, and offered a compromise. ""Dial 999 and call an ambulance then. Quickly, now.""Suddenly the girl's eyes opened, white and wide in a face that was little more than a smudge of dust and blood. ""Not a hospital, please. They'll find me. Take me somewhere safe. Please."" Her voice was weak.""You're bleeding,"" said Richard. He looked to see where she had come from, but the wall was blank and brick and unbroken. He looked back to her still form, and asked, ""Why not a hospital?""""Help me?"" the girl whispered and her eyes closed.Again he asked her, ""Why don't you want to go to the hospital?"" This time there was no answer at all.""When you call the ambulance,"" said Jessica, ""don't give your name. You might have to make a statement or something, and then we'd be late . . . Richard? What are you doing?""Richard had picked the girl up, cradling her in his arms. She was surprisingly light. ""I'm taking her back to my place, Jess. I can't just leave her. Tell Mister Stockton I'm really sorry, but it was an emergency. I'm sure he'll understand.""""Richard Oliver Mayhew,"" said Jessica, coldly. ""You put that girl down and come back here this minute. Or this engagement is at an end as of now. I'm warning you.""Richard felt the sticky warmth of blood soaking into his shirt. Sometimes, he realized, there is nothing you can do. He walked away, leaving behind Jessica, who stood there on the sidewalk, her eyes stung with tears.Richard did not, at any point on his walk, stop to think. It was not something over which he had any volition. Somewhere in the sensible part of his head, someone-a normal, sensible Richard Mayhew-was telling him how ridiculous he was being: that he should just have called the police, or an ambulance; that it was dangerous to lift an injured person; that he had really, seriously upset Jessica; that he was going to have to sleep on the sofa tonight; that he was ruining his only really good suit; that the girl smelled terrible . . . but Richard found himself placing one foot in front of the other, and, arms cramping and back hurting, ignoring the looks he got from passers-by, he just kept walking. And after a while he was at the ground floor door of his building, and he was stumbling up the staircase, and then he was standing in front of the door to his apartment and realizing that he had left his keys on the hall table, inside . . .The girl reached out one filthy hand to the door, and it swung open.Never thought I'd be pleased that the door hadn't latched properly, thought Richard, and he carried the girl in-closing the door behind him with his foot-and put her down on his bed. His shirtfront was soaked in blood.She seemed semiconscious; her eyes were closed, but fluttering. He peeled off her leather jacket. There was a long cut on her left upper arm and shoulder. Richard caught his breath. ""Look, I'm going to call a doctor,"" he said quietly. ""Can you hear me?""Her eyes opened, wide and scared. ""Please, no. It'll be fine. It's not as bad as it looks. I just need sleep. No doctors.""""But your arm-your shoulder-""""I'll be fine. Tomorrow. Please?"" It was little more than a whisper.""Um, I suppose, all right,"" and with sanity beginning to assert itself, he said, ""Look, can I ask-?""But she was asleep. Richard took an old scarf from his closet and wrapped it firmly around her left upper arm and shoulder; he did not want her to bleed to death on his bed before he could get her to a doctor. And then he tiptoed out of his bedroom and shut the door behind him. He sat down on the sofa, in front of the television, and wondered what he had done.
NW_ch2	NW	Neverwhere	2	7006	39935	NeverwhereTWOHe is somewhere deep beneath the ground: in a tunnel, perhaps, or a sewer. Light comes in flickers, defining the darkness, not dispelling it. He is not alone. There are other people walking beside him, although he cannot see their faces. They are running, now, through the inside of the sewer, splashing through the mud and filth. Droplets of water fall slowly through the air, crystal clear in the darkness.He turns a corner, and the beast is waiting for him.It is huge. It fills the space of the sewer: massive head down, bristled body and breath steaming in the chill of the air. Some kind of boar, he thinks at first, and then realizes that no boar could be so huge. It is the size of a bull, of a tiger, of an ox.It stares at him, and it pauses for a hundred years, while he lifts his spear. He glances at his hand, holding the spear, and observes that it is not his hand: the arm is furred with dark hair, the nails are almost claws.And then the beast charges.He throws his spear, but it is already too late, and he feels the beast slice his side with razor-sharp tusks, feels his life slip away into the mud: and he realizes he has fallen face down into the water, which crimsons in thick swirls of suffocating blood. And he tries so to scream, he tries to wake up, but he can breathe only mud and blood and water, he can feel only pain . . .""Bad dream?"" asked the girl.Richard sat up on the couch, gasping for breath. The curtains were still drawn, the lights and the television still on, but he could tell, from the pale light coming in through the cracks, that it was morning. He fumbled on the couch for the remote control, which had wedged itself into the small of his back during the night, and he turned off the television.""Yes,"" he said. ""Sort of.""He wiped away the sleep from his eyes and took stock of himself, pleased to notice that he had at least taken off his shoes and jacket before he had fallen asleep. His shirtfront was covered with dried blood and with dirt. The homeless girl didn't say anything. She looked bad: pale, beneath the grime and brown dried blood, and small. She was dressed in a variety of clothes thrown over each other: odd clothes, dirty velvets, muddy lace, rips and holes through which other layers and styles could be seen. She looked, Richard thought, as if she'd done a midnight raid on the History of Fashion section of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and was still wearing everything she'd taken. Her short hair was filthy, but looked like it might have been a dark reddish color under the dirt.""You're awake,"" said Richard.""Whose barony is this?"" asked the girl. ""Whose fiefdom?""""Um. Sorry?""She looked around her suspiciously. ""Where am I?""""Newton Mansions, Little Comden Street . . . "" He stopped. She had opened the curtains, blinking at the cold daylight. The girl stared out at the rather ordinary view from Richard's window, astonished, peering wide-eyed at the cars and the buses and the tiny sprawl of shops-a bakery, a drugstore and a liquor store-below them.""I'm in London Above,"" she said, in a small voice.""Yes, you're in London,"" said Richard. Above what? he wondered. ""I think maybe you were in shock or something last night. That is a nasty cut on your arm."" He waited for her to say something, to explain. She glanced at him, and then looked back down at the buses and the shops. Richard continued: ""I, um, found you on the pavement. There was a lot of blood.""""Don't worry,"" she said, seriously. ""Most of the blood was someone else's.""She let the curtain fall back. Then she began to unwrap the scarf, now bloodstained and crusted, from her arm. She examined the cut and made a face. ""We're going to have to do something about this,"" she said. ""Do you want to give me a hand?""Richard was beginning to feel a little out of his depth. ""I don't really know too much about first aid,"" he said.""Well,"" she said, ""if you're really squeamish you only have to hold the bandages and tie the ends where I can't reach. You do have bandages, don't you?""Richard nodded. ""Oh yes,"" he said. ""In the first aid kit. In the bathroom. Under the sink."" And then he went into his bedroom and changed his clothes, wondering whether the mess on his shirt (his best shirt, bought for him by, oh God, Jessica, she would have a fit) would ever come off.The bloody water reminded him of something, some kind of dream he had once had, perhaps, but he could no longer, for the life of him, remember exactly what. He pulled the plug, let the water out of the sink, and filled it with clean water again, to which he added a cloudy splash of liquid disinfectant: the sharp antiseptic smell seemed so utterly sensible and medicinal, a remedy for the oddness of his situation, and his visitor. The girl leaned over the sink, and he splashed warm water over her arm and shoulder.Richard was never as squeamish as he thought he was. Or rather, he was squeamish when it came to blood on screen: a good zombie movie or even an explicit medical drama would leave him huddled in a corner, hyperventilating, with his hands over his eyes, muttering things like ""Just tell me when it's over."" But when it came to real blood, real pain, he simply did something about it. They cleaned out the cut-which was much less severe than Richard remembered it from the night before-and bandaged it up, and the girl did her very best not to wince in the process. And Richard found himself wondering how old she was, and what she looked like under the grime, and why she was living on the streets and-""What's your name?"" she asked.""Richard. Richard Mayhew. Dick."" She nodded, as if she were committing it to memory. The doorbell rang. Richard looked at the mess in the bathroom, and the girl, and wondered how it would look to an outside observer. Such as, for example . . . ""Oh Lord,"" he said, realizing the worst. ""I bet it's Jess. She's going to kill me."" Damage control. Damage control. ""Look,"" he told the girl. ""You wait in here.""He shut the door of the bathroom behind him and walked down the hall. He opened the front door, and breathed a huge and quite heartfelt sigh of relief. It wasn't Jessica. It was-what? Mormons? Jehovah's Witnesses? The police? He couldn't tell. There were two of them, at any rate.They wore black suits, which were slightly greasy, slightly frayed, and even Richard, who counted himself among the sartorially dyslexic, felt there was something odd about the cut of the coats. They were the kind of suits that might have been made by a tailor two hundred years ago who had had a modern suit described to him but had never actually seen one. The lines were wrong, and so were the grace notes.A fox and a wolf, thought Richard, involuntarily. The man in front, the fox, was a little shorter than Richard. He had lank, greasy hair, of an unlikely orange color, and a pallid complexion; as Richard opened the door, he smiled, widely, and just a fraction too late, with teeth that looked like an accident in a graveyard. ""A good morrow to you, good sir,"" he said, ""on this fine and beautiful day.""""Ah. Hello,"" said Richard.""We are conducting a personal enquiry of a delicate nature as it were, door to door. Do you mind if we come in?""""Well, it's not very convenient right now,"" said Richard. Then he asked, ""Are you with the police?"" The second of the visitors, a tall man, the one he had thought of as a wolf, his gray and black hair cut bristle-short, stood a little behind his friend, holding a stack of photocopies to his chest. He had said nothing until this moment-just waited, huge and impassive. Now he laughed, once, low and dirtily. There was something unhealthy about that laugh.""The police? Alas,"" said the smaller man, ""we cannot claim that felicity. A career in law and order, although indubitably enticing, was not inscribed on the cards Dame Fortuna dealt my brother and me. No, we are merely private citizens. Allow me to make introductions. I am Mister Croup, and this gentleman is my brother, Mister Vandemar.""They did not look like brothers. They did not look like anything Richard had seen before. ""Your brother?"" asked Richard. ""Shouldn't you have the same name?""""I am impressed. What a brain, Mister Vandemar. Keen and incisive isn't the half of it. Some of us are so sharp,"" he said as he leaned in closer to Richard, went up on tiptoes into Richard's face, ""we could just cut ourselves."" Richard took an involuntary step backwards. ""Can we come inside?"" asked Mr. Croup.""What do you want?""Mr. Croup sighed, in what he obviously imagined was a rather wistful manner. ""We are looking for our sister,"" he explained. ""A wayward child, willful and headstrong, who has close to broken our poor dear widowed mother's heart.""""Ran away,"" explained Mr. Vandemar, quietly. He thrust a photocopied sheet into Richard's hands. ""She's a little . . . funny,"" he added, and then he twirled one finger next to his temple in the universal gesture to indicate mental incapacity.Richard looked down at the paper. It said:HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL?Beneath that was a photocopy-gray photograph of a girl who looked to Richard like a cleaner, longer-haired version of the young lady he had left in his bathroom.Under that it said:ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF DOREEN. BITES AND KICKS. RUN AWAY. TELL US IF YOU SAW HER. WANT HER BACK. REWARD PAYED.And below that, a telephone number. Richard looked back at the photograph. It was definitely the girl in his bathroom. ""No,"" he said. ""I haven't seen her, I'm afraid. I'm sorry.""Mr. Vandemar, however, was not listening. He had raised his head and was sniffing the air, like a man smelling something odd or unpleasant. Richard reached out to give him back his piece of paper, but the big man simply pushed past him and walked into the apartment, a wolf on the prowl. Richard ran after him. ""What do you think you are doing? Will you stop that? Get out. Look, you can't go in there-"" Mr. Vandemar was headed straight for the bathroom. Richard hoped that the girl-Doreen?-had had the presence of mind to lock the bathroom door. But no; it swung open at Mr. Vandemar's push. He walked in, and Richard, feeling like a small and ineffectual dog yapping at the heels of a postman, followed him in.It was not a large bathroom. It contained a bathtub, a toilet, a sink, several bottles of shampoo, a bar of soap, and a towel. When Richard had left it, a couple of minutes before, it had also contained a dirty, bloody girl, a very bloody sink, and an open first aid kit. Now, it was gleamingly clean.There was nowhere the girl could have been hiding. Mr. Vandemar stepped out of the bathroom and pushed open Richard's bedroom door, walked in, looked around. ""I don't know what you think you're doing,"" said Richard. ""But if you two don't get out of my apartment this minute, I'm phoning the police.""Then Mr. Vandemar, who had been in the process of examining Richard's living room, turned back toward Richard, and Richard suddenly realized that he had never been so scared of another human being in his life.And then foxy Mr. Croup said, ""Why yes, whatever can have come over you, Mister Vandemar? It's grief for our dear sweet sibling, I'll wager, has turned his head. Now apologize to the gentleman, Mister Vandemar.""Mr. Vandemar nodded, and pondered for a moment. ""Thought I needed to use the toilet,"" he said. ""Didn't. Sorry.""Mr. Croup began to walk down the hall, pushing Mr. Vandemar in front of him. ""There. Now, you'll forgive my errant brother his lack of social graces, I trust. Worry over our poor dear widowed mother, and over our sister, whom even as we speak is wandering the streets of London unloved and uncared-for, has nigh unhinged him, I'll be bound. But for all that, he's a good fellow to have at your side. Is't not so, stout fellow?"" They were out of Richard's apartment now, into the stairwell. Mr. Vandemar said nothing. He did not look unhinged with grief. Croup turned back to Richard and essayed another foxy smile. ""You will tell us if you see her,"" he said.""Good-bye,"" said Richard. Then he closed the door and locked it. And, for the first time since he had lived there, he attached the security chain.Mr. Croup, who had cut Richard's phone line at the first mention of calling the police, was starting to wonder whether he had cut the right cord or not. Twentieth-century telecommunications technology not being his strongest point. He took one of the photocopies from Vandemar, and positioned it on the wall of the stairwell. ""Spit!"" he said to Vandemar.Mr. Vandemar hawked a mouthful of phlegm from the back of his throat and spat it neatly onto the back of the handbill. Mr. Croup slapped the handbill hard onto the wall, next to Richard's door. It stuck immediately and stuck hard.HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? it asked.Mr. Croup turned to Mr. Vandemar. ""Do you believe him?""They turned back down the stairs. ""Do I Hell,"" said Mr. Vandemar. ""I could smell her.""Richard waited by his front door until he heard the main door slam, several floors below. He started to walk down the hall, back toward the bathroom, when the phone rang loudly, startling him. He sprinted back down the hall and picked up the receiver. ""Hello?"" said Richard. ""Hello?""No sound came out of the receiver. Instead, there was a click, and Jessica's voice came out of the answering machine on the table next to the phone. Her voice said, ""Richard? This is Jessica. I'm sorry you're not there, because this would have been our last conversation, and I did so want to tell you this to your face."" The phone, he realized, was completely dead. The receiver trailed a foot or so of cord, and was then neatly cut off.""You embarrassed me very deeply last night, Richard,"" the voice continued. ""As far as I'm concerned our engagement is at an end. I have no intention of returning the ring, nor indeed of ever seeing you again. Bye.""The tape stopped turning, there was another click, and the little red light began to flash.""Bad news?"" asked the girl. She was standing just behind him, in the kitchen part of the apartment, with her arm neatly bandaged. She was getting out tea bags, putting them in mugs. The kettle was boiling.""Yes,"" said Richard. ""Very bad."" He walked over to her, handed her the HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? poster. ""That's you, isn't it?""She raised an eyebrow. ""The photograph's me.""""And you are . . . Doreen?""She shook her head. ""I'm Door, Richardrichard-mayhewdick. Milk and sugar?""Richard was feeling utterly out of his league by now. And he said, ""Richard. Just Richard. No sugar."" Then he said, ""Look, if it isn't a personal question, what happened to you?""Door poured the boiling water into the mugs. ""You don't want to know,"" she said, simply.""Oh, well, I'm sorry if I-""""No. Richard. Honestly, you don't want to know. It wouldn't do you any good. You've done more than you should have already.""She removed the tea bags and handed him a mug of tea. He took it from her and realized that he was still carrying around the receiver. ""Well. I mean. I couldn't just have left you there.""""You could have,"" she said. ""You didn't."" She pressed herself up against the wall and peered out of the window. Richard walked over to the window and looked out. Across the street, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were coming out of the bakery, and HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? was stuck in a place of prominence in its window.""Are they really your brothers?"" he asked.""Please,"" said Door. ""Give me a break.""He sipped his tea and tried to pretend that everything was normal. ""So where were you?"" he asked. ""Just now?""""I was here,"" she said. ""Look, with those two still around we have to get a message to . . . "" She paused. ""To someone who can help. I don't dare leave here.""""Well, isn't there somewhere you could go? Someone that we could call?""She took the dead receiver from his hand, wire trailing, and shook her head. ""My friends aren't on the phone,"" she said. She put it back in its cradle, where it sat, useless and lonely. Then she smiled, fast and wicked. ""Breadcrumbs,"" she said.""Sorry?"" said Richard.There was a little window in the back of the bedroom that looked out on an area of roof tiles and gutters. Door stood on Richard's bed to reach it, opened the window, and sprinkled the breadcrumbs around. ""But I don't understand,"" said Richard.""Of course you don't,"" she agreed. ""Now, shush."" There was a flutter of wings, and the purple-gray-green sheen of a pigeon. It pecked at the breadcrumbs, and Door reached out her right hand and picked it up. It looked at her curiously but made no complaint.They sat down on the bed. Door got Richard to hold the pigeon, while she attached a message to its leg, using a vivid blue rubber band that Richard had previously used to keep his electricity bills all in one place. Richard was not an enthusiastic holder of pigeons, even at the best of times. ""I don't see the point in this,"" he explained. ""I mean, it's not a homing pigeon. It's just a normal London pigeon. The kind that craps on Lord Nelson.""""That's right,"" said Door. Her cheek was grazed, and her dirty reddish hair was tangled; tangled, but not matted. And her eyes . . . Richard realized that he could not tell what color her eyes were. They were not blue, or green, or brown, or gray; they reminded him of fire opals: there were burning greens and blues, and even reds and yellows that vanished and glinted as she moved. She took the bird from him, gently, held it up, and looked it in the face. It tipped its head on one side and stared back at her with bead-black eyes. ""Okay,"" she said, and then she made a noise that sounded like the liquid burbling of pigeons. ""Okay Crrppllrr, you're looking for the marquis de Carabas. You got that?""The pigeon burbled liquidly back at her.""Attagirl. Now, this is important, so you'd better-"" The pigeon interrupted her with a rather impatient-sounding burble. ""I'm sorry,"" said Door. ""You know what you're doing, of course."" She took the bird to the window and let it go.Richard had watched the whole routine with some amazement. ""Do you know, it almost sounded like it understood you?"" he said, as the bird shrank in the sky and vanished behind some rooftops.""How about that,"" said Door. ""Now. We wait.""She went over to the bookshelf in the corner of the bedroom, found a copy of Mansfield Park Richard had not previously known that he possessed, and went into the living room. Richard followed her. She settled herself on his sofa and opened the book.""So is it short for Doreen?"" he asked.""What?""""Your name.""""No. It's just Door.""""How do you spell it?""""D-o-o-r. Like something you walk through to go places.""""Oh."" He had to say something, so he said, ""What kind of a name is Door, then?""And she looked at him with her odd-colored eyes, and she said, ""My name."" Then she went back to Jane Austen.Richard picked up the remote control and turned on the television. Then he changed the channel. Changed it again. Sighed. Changed it again. ""So, what are we waiting for?""Door turned the page. She didn't look up. ""A reply.""""What kind of a reply?"" Door shrugged. ""Oh. Right."" It occurred to Richard then that her skin was very white, now that some of the dirt and blood had been removed. He wondered if she were pale from illness, or from loss of blood, or if she simply didn't get out much, or was anemic. Maybe she'd been in prison, although she looked a bit too young for that. Perhaps the big man had been telling the truth when he had said she was mad. ""Listen, when those men came over . . . """"Men?"" A flash of the opal-colored eyes.""Croup and, um, Vanderbilt.""""Vandemar."" She mused for a moment, then nodded. ""I suppose you could call them men, yes. Two legs, two arms, a head each.""Richard kept talking. ""When they came in here, before. Where were you?""She licked her finger and turned a page. ""I was here.""""But-"" He stopped talking, out of words. There wasn't anywhere in the apartment that she could have hidden herself. But she hadn't left the apartment. But-There was a scratching noise, and a dark shape larger than a mouse scurried out from the mess of videotapes beneath the television. ""Jesus!"" said Richard, and he threw the remote control at it as hard as he could. It crashed into the videos with a bang. Of the dark shape there was no sign.""Richard!"" said Door.""It's okay,"" he explained. ""I think it was just a rat or something.""She glared at him. ""Of course it was a rat. You'll have scared it now, poor thing."" She looked around the room, then made a low whistling noise between her front teeth. ""Hello?"" she called. She knelt on the floor, Mansfield Park abandoned. ""Hello?""She flashed a glance back at Richard. ""If you've hurt it . . . "" she threatened; then, softly, to the room, ""I'm sorry, he's an idiot. Hello?""""I'm not an idiot,"" said Richard.""Shh,"" she said. ""Hello?"" A pink nose and two small black eyes peered out from under the sofa. The rest of the head followed, and it scrutinized its surroundings suspiciously. It was indeed much too big to be a mouse, Richard was certain of that. ""Hi,"" said Door, warmly. ""Are you okay?"" She extended her hand. The animal climbed into it, then ran up her arm, nestling in the crook of it. Door stroked its side with her finger. It was dark brown, with a long pink tail. There was something that looked like a folded piece of paper attached to its side.""It's a rat,"" said Richard.""Yes, it is. Are you going to apologize?""""What?""""Apologize.""Maybe he hadn't heard her properly. Maybe he was the one who was going mad. ""To a rat?""Door said nothing, fairly meaningfully. ""I'm sorry,"" said Richard, to the rat, with dignity, ""if I startled you.""The rat looked up at Door. ""No, he really does mean it,"" she said. ""He's not just saying it. So what have you got for me?"" She fumbled at the rat's side, and pulled out a much-folded piece of brown paper, which had been held on with something that looked to Richard like a vivid blue rubber band.She opened it up: a piece of ragged-edged brown paper, with spidery black handwriting on it. She read it and nodded. ""Thank you,"" she said, to the rat. ""I appreciate all you've done."" It scampered down onto the couch, glared up at Richard for a moment, and then was gone in the shadows.The girl called Door passed the paper to Richard. ""Here,"" she said. ""Read this.""It was late afternoon in Central London, and, with autumn drawing on, it was getting dark. Richard had taken the Tube to Tottenham Court Road and was now walking west down Oxford Street, holding the piece of paper. Oxford Street was the retail hub of London, and even now the sidewalks were packed with shoppers and tourists.""It's a message,"" she said, when she gave it to him. ""From the marquis de Carabas.""Richard was sure he had heard the name before. ""That's nice,"" he said. ""Out of postcards, was he?""""This is quicker.""He passed the lights and the noise of the Virgin megastore, and the shop that sold souvenir London police helmets and little red London buses, and the place next door that sold individual slices of pizza, and then he turned right.""You have to follow the directions written on here. Try not to let anyone follow you."" Then she sighed, and said, ""I really shouldn't involve you this much.""""If I follow these directions . . . will it get you out of here faster?""""Yes.""He turned into Hanway Street. Although he had taken only a few steps from the well-lit bustle of Oxford Street, he might have been in another city: Hanway Street was empty, forsaken; a narrow, dark road, little more than an alleyway, filled with gloomy record shops and closed restaurants, the only light spilling out from the secretive drinking clubs on the upper floors of buildings. He walked along it, feeling apprehensive."" ' . . . turn right into Hanway Street, left into Hanway Place, then right again into Orme Passage. Stop at the first streetlight you come to . . . ' Are you sure this is right?""""Yes.""He did not remember an Orme Passage, although he had been to Hanway Place before: there was an underground Indian restaurant there his friend Gary liked a lot. As far as Richard could remember, Hanway Place was a dead end. The Mandeer, that was the restaurant. He passed the brightly lit front door, the restaurant's steps leading invitingly down into the underground, and then he turned left . . .He had been wrong. There was an Orme Passage. He could see the sign for it, high on the wall.ORME PASSAGE WlNo wonder he hadn't noticed it before: it was scarcely more than a narrow alleyway between houses, lit by a sputtering gas-jet. You don't see many of those anymore, thought Richard, and he held up his instructions to the gaslight, peering at them."" 'Then turn around thrice, widdershins'?""""Widdershins means counterclockwise, Richard.""He turned, three times, feeling stupid. ""Look, why do I have to do all this, just to see your friend. I mean, all this nonsense . . . """"It's not nonsense. Really. Just-humor me on this, okay?"" And she had smiled at him.He stopped turning. Then he walked down the alley to the end. Nothing. No one. Just a metal garbage can, and beside it something that might have been a pile of rags. ""Hello?"" called Richard. ""Is anyone here? I'm Door's friend. Hello?""No. There was no one there. Richard was relieved. Now he could go home and explain to the girl that nothing had happened. Then he would call in the appropriate authorities, and they would sort it all out. He crumpled the paper into a tight ball, and tossed it toward the bin.What Richard had taken for a pile of rags unfolded, expanded, stood up in one fluid motion. A hand caught the crumpled paper in midair.""Mine, I believe,"" said the marquis de Carabas. He wore a huge dandyish black coat that was not quite a frock coat nor exactly a trench coat, and high black boots, and, beneath his coat, raggedy clothes. His eyes burned white in an extremely dark face. And he grinned white teeth, momentarily, as if at a private joke of his own, and bowed to Richard, and said, ""De Carabas, at your service, and you are . . . ?""""Um,"" said Richard. ""Er. Um.""""You are Richard Mayhew, the young man who rescued our wounded Door. How is she now?""""Er. She's okay. Her arm's still a bit-""""Her recovery time will undoubtedly astonish us all. Her family had remarkable recuperative powers. It's a wonder anyone managed to kill them at all, isn't it?"" The man who called himself the marquis de Carabas walked restlessly up and down the alley. Richard could already tell that he was the type of person who was always in motion, like a great cat.""Somebody killed Door's family?"" asked Richard.""We're not going to get very far if you keep repeating everything I say, now, are we?"" said the marquis, who was now standing in front of Richard. ""Sit down,"" he ordered. Richard looked around the alley for something to sit on. The marquis put a hand on his shoulder and sent him sprawling to the cobblestones. ""She knows I don't come cheap. What exactly is she offering me?""""Sorry?""""What's the deal? She sent you here to negotiate, young man. I'm not cheap, and I never give freebies.""Richard shrugged, as well as he could shrug from a supine position. ""She said to tell you that she wants you to accompany her home-wherever that is-and to fix her up with a bodyguard.""Even when the marquis was at rest, his eyes never ceased moving. Up, down, around, as if he were looking for something, thinking about something. Adding, subtracting, evaluating. Richard wondered whether the man was quite sane. ""And she's offering me?""""Well. Nothing.""The marquis blew on his fingernails and polished them on the lapel of his remarkable coat. Then he turned away. ""She's offering me. Nothing."" He sounded offended.Richard scrambled back up to his feet. ""Well, she didn't say anything about money. She just said she was going to have to owe you a favor.""The eyes flashed. ""Exactly what kind of favor?""""A really big one,"" said Richard. ""She said she was going to have to owe you a really big favor.""De Carabas grinned to himself, a hungry panther sighting a lost peasant child. Then he turned on Richard. ""And you left her alone?"" he asked. ""With Croup and Vandemar out there? Well, what are you waiting for?"" He knelt down and took from his pocket a small metal object, which he pushed into a manhole cover at the edge of the alley and twisted. The manhole cover came up easily; the marquis put away the metal object and took something out of another pocket that reminded Richard a little of a long firework, or a flare. He held it in one hand, ran his other hand along it, and the far end erupted into scarlet flame.""Can I ask a question?"" said Richard.""Certainly not,"" said the marquis. ""You don't ask any questions. You don't get any answers. You don't stray from the path. You don't even think about what's happening to you right now. Got it?""""But-""""Most important of all: no buts,"" said de Carabas. ""And time is of the essence. Move."" He pointed into the depths revealed by the open manhole cover. Richard moved, clambering down the metal ladder set into the wall beneath the manhole, feeling so far out of his depth that it didn't even occur to him to question any further.Richard wondered where they were. This didn't seem to be a sewer. Perhaps it was a tunnel for telephone cables, or for very small trains. Or for . . . something else. He realized that he did not know very much about what went on beneath the streets of London. He walked nervously, worried that he'd catch his feet in something, that he'd stumble in the darkness and break his ankle. De Carabas strode on ahead, nonchalantly, apparently not caring whether Richard was with him or not. The crimson flame cast huge shadows on the tunnel walls.Richard ran to catch up. ""Let's see . . . "" said de Carabas. ""I'll need to get her to the market. The next one's in, mm, two days' time, if I recall correctly, as of course I unfailingly do. I can hide her until then.""""Market?"" asked Richard.""The Floating Market. But you don't want to know about that. No more questions.""Richard looked around. ""Well, I was going to ask you where we are now. But I suppose you were going to refuse to tell me.""The marquis grinned once more. ""Very good,"" he said, approvingly. ""You are in enough trouble already.""""You can say that again,"" sighed Richard. ""My fiancee's dumped me, and I'll probably have to get a new telephone-""""Temple and Arch. A telephone is the least of your troubles."" De Carabas put the flare down on the ground, resting it against the wall, where it continued to sputter and flame, and he began to climb up some metal rungs set into the wall. Richard hesitated, and then followed him. The rungs were cold and rusted; he could feel them crumbling roughly against his hands as he climbed, fragments of rust getting in his eyes and mouth. The scarlet light from below was flickering, and then it went out. They climbed in total darkness.""So, are we going back to Door?"" Richard asked.""Eventually. There's a little something I need to organize first. Insurance. And when we get into daylight, don't look down.""""Why not?"" asked Richard. And then daylight hit his face, and he looked down.It was daylight (how was it daylight? a tiny voice asked, in the back of his head. It had been almost night when he entered the alley, what, an hour ago?), and he was holding onto a metal ladder that ran up the outside of a very high building (but a few seconds ago he was climbing up the same ladder, and he had been inside, hadn't he?), and below him, he could see . . .London.Tiny cars. Tiny buses and taxis. Tiny buildings. Trees. Miniature trucks. Tiny, tiny people. They swam in and out of focus beneath him.To say that Richard Mayhew was not very good at heights would be perfectly accurate, but it would fail to give the full picture. Richard hated clifftops, and high buildings: somewhere not far inside him was the fear-the stark, utter, silently screaming terror-that if he got too close to the edge, then something would take over and he would find himself walking to the edge of a clifftop and stepping off into space. It was as if he could not entirely trust himself, and that scared Richard more than the simple fear of falling ever could. So he called it vertigo, and hated it and himself, and kept away from high places.Richard froze on the ladder. His hands clamped tightly to the rungs. His eyes hurt, somewhere behind the eyeballs. He started breathing too fast, too deeply. ""Somebody,"" said an amused voice above him, ""wasn't listening, was he?""""I . . . "" Richard's throat didn't work. He swallowed, moistening it. ""I can't move."" His hands were sweating. What if they sweated so much that he simply slipped off into the void . . . ?""Of course you can move. Or, if you don't you can stay here, hanging onto the side of the wall until your hands freeze and your legs buckle and you tumble to a messy death a thousand feet below."" Richard looked up at the marquis. He was looking down at Richard, and still smiling; when he saw that Richard was watching him, he let go of the rungs with both his hands, and waggled his fingers at him.Richard felt a wave of sympathetic vertigo run through him. ""Bastard,"" he said, under his breath, and he let go of the rung with his right hand and moved it up eight inches, until it found the next rung. Then he moved his right leg up one rung. Then he did it again, with his left hand. After a while he found himself at the edge of a flat roof, and he stepped over it and collapsed.He was aware that the marquis was striding along the roof, away from him. Richard felt the rooftop with his hands, and felt the solid structure beneath him. His heart was pounding in his chest.A gruff voice some distance away shouted, ""You're not wanted here, de Carabas. Get away. Clear off.""""Old Bailey,"" he heard de Carabas say. ""You're looking wonderfully healthy.""And then footsteps, shuffled toward him, and a finger prodded him gently in the ribs. ""You all right, laddie? I've got some stew cookin' back there. You want some? It's starling.""Richard opened his eyes. ""No thank you,"" he said. He saw the feathers, first. He wasn't sure if it was a coat, or a cape, or some kind of strange covering that had no name, but whatever kind of outer garment it was, it was covered thickly and entirely in feathers. A face, kind and creased, with grey muttonchop whiskers, peered out from the top of the feathers. The body beneath the face, where it was not covered with feathers, was wound round and about with ropes. Richard found himself remembering a theatrical performance of Robinson Crusoe he had been taken to as a child: this was what Robinson Crusoe might have looked like, if he had been shipwrecked on a rooftop instead of a desert island.""They call me Old Bailey, lad,"" said the man. He fumbled at a battered pair of glasses, on a string around his neck, and pulled them on, staring through them at Richard. ""I don't recognize ye. What barony do you give fealty to? What's your name?""Richard pulled himself into a sitting position. They were on the roof of an old building, built of brown stone, with a tower above them. Weathered gargoyles, missing wings and limbs and, in a couple of cases, even heads, jutted sadly from the corners of the tower. From far below he could hear the wail of a police siren, and the muted roar of traffic. Across the rooftop, in the shadow of the tower, was something that looked like a tent; an old brown tent, much mended, spackled white with bird shit. He opened his mouth to tell the old man his name.""You. Shut up,"" said the marquis de Carabas. ""Don't say another word."" Then he turned to Old Bailey. ""People who put their noses where they aren't wanted sometimes""-he snapped his fingers, loudly, beneath the old man's nose, making him jump-""lose them. Now. You've owed me a favor for twenty years, Old Bailey. A big favor. And I'm calling it in.""The old man blinked. ""I was a fool,"" he said quietly.""No fool like an old fool,"" agreed the marquis. He reached a hand into an inside pocket of his coat and pulled out a silver box, larger than a snuffbox, smaller than a cigar box, and a good deal more ornate than either. ""Do you know what this is?""""I wish I didn't.""""You'll keep it safe for me.""""I don't want it.""""You don't have any choice,"" said the marquis. The old roof-man took the silver box from him and held it, awkwardly, in both hands, as if it were something that might explode at any moment. The marquis prodded Richard gently with his square-toed black boot: ""Right,"" he said. ""We'd better get a move on, hadn't we?"" He strode off across the roof, and Richard got to his feet and followed, keeping well away from the side of the building. The marquis opened a door in the side of the tower, beside a high cluster of chimneys, and they went down a poorly lit spiral staircase.""Who was that man?"" asked Richard, peering through the dim light. Their footsteps echoed and reverberated down the metal stairs.The marquis de Carabas snorted. ""You haven't heard a word I've said, have you? You're in trouble already. Everything you do, everything you say, everything you hear, just makes it worse. You had better pray you haven't stepped too far in.""It was now completely dark, and Richard stumbled slightly as he reached the last of the steps and found himself looking for a step that wasn't there. ""Mind your head,"" said the marquis, and he opened a door. Richard banged his forehead into something hard and said ""ow,"" and then he stepped out through a low door, shielding his eyes against the light.Richard rubbed his forehead, then he rubbed his eyes. The door they had just come through was the door to the broom closet in the stairwell of his apartment building. It was filled with brooms, an elderly mop, and a huge variety of cleaning fluids, powders, and waxes. It had no stairs at the back of it that he could see, just a wall on which a stained old calendar hung, quite uselessly-unless 1979 ever came back around.The marquis was examining the HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? poster stuck beside Richard's front door. ""Not her best side,"" he said.Richard shut the door to the broom closet. He took his keys from his back pocket, unlocked his front door, and he was home. It was, he was rather relieved to see through the kitchen windows, night-time once more.""Richard,"" said Door. ""You did it."" She had washed herself while he was gone, and her layers of clothes looked like she had at least made an effort to get the worst of the filth and the blood off them. The grime was gone from her face and hands. Her hair, when washed, was a dark shade of auburn, with copper and bronze highlights. Richard wondered how old she was: fifteen? Sixteen? Older? He still couldn't tell.She had put on the brown leather jacket she had been wearing when he had found her, huge and enveloping, like an old flying jacket, which somehow made her look smaller than she was, and even more vulnerable.""Well, yes,"" said Richard.The marquis de Carabas went down on one knee to the girl and lowered his head. ""My lady,"" he said.She seemed uncomfortable. ""Oh, do get up, de Carabas. I'm pleased you came.""He stood in one smooth movement. ""I understand,"" he said, ""that the words favor, really, and big have been used. In conjunction.""""Later."" She walked over to Richard and took his hands in hers. ""Richard. Thanks. I really appreciate everything you've done. I changed the sheets on the bed. And I wish there was something I could do to pay you back.""""You're leaving?""She nodded. ""I'll be safe now. More or less. I hope. For a little while.""""Where are you going now?""She smiled gently and shook her head. ""Uh-uh. I'm out of your life. And you've been wonderful."" She went up on tiptoes then and kissed him on the cheek, as friends kiss friends.""If I ever need to get in touch with you-?""""You don't. Ever. And . . . "" and then she paused. ""Look, I'm sorry, okay?""Richard inspected his feet, in an awkward sort of way. ""There's nothing to be sorry about,"" he said, and added, doubtfully, ""it was fun."" Then he looked up again.But there was nobody there.
NW_ch3	NW	Neverwhere	3	3754	21560	NeverwhereTHREEOn Sunday morning Richard took the Batmobile-shaped telephone he had been given for Christmas several years earlier by his Aunt Maude out of the drawer at the bottom of the closet and plugged it into the wall. He tried telephoning Jessica, but without success. Her answering machine was turned off, as was her cellular phone. He supposed she had gone back to her parents' house in the country, and he had no desire to phone her there. Richard found Jessica's parents deeply intimidating, each in their separate ways. Neither of them had entirely approved of him as a future son-in-law: in fact, her mother had, on one occasion, mentioned to him quite casually how disappointed they were by Richard and Jessica's engagement, and her conviction that Jessica could, if she wanted to, do so much better.Richard's own parents were both dead. His father had died quite suddenly when Richard was still a small boy, of a heart attack. His mother died very slowly after that, and once Richard left home she simply faded away: six months after he moved to London he took the train back up to Scotland, to spend her last two days in a small county hospital sitting beside her bed. Sometimes she had known him; at other times she had called him by his father's name.Richard sat on his couch, and he brooded. The events of the previous two days became less and less real, increasingly less likely. What was real was the message that Jessica had left on his machine, telling him she did not want to see him again. He played it, and replayed it, that Sunday, hoping each time that she would relent, that he'd hear warmth in her voice. He never did.He thought about going out and buying a Sunday paper but decided not to. Arnold Stockton, Jessica's boss, a many-chinned, self-made caricature of a man, owned all the Sunday papers that Rupert Murdoch had failed to buy. His own papers talked about him, and so did the rest. Reading a Sunday paper would, Richard suspected, probably end up reminding him of the dinner he had failed to attend on Friday night. So instead Richard had a long hot bath and a number of sandwiches, and several cups of tea. He watched a little Sunday afternoon television and constructed conversations with Jessica in his head. At the end of each mental dialogue they would fall into each other's arms, make wild, angry, tear-stained and passionate love; and then everything would be all right.On Monday morning Richard's alarm failed to go off. He came out onto the street at a run at ten to nine, briefcase swinging, staring up and down the road like a madman, praying for a taxi. Then he sighed with relief, because a big black car was heading down the road toward him, its yellow ""taxi"" sign bright. He waved at it and yelled.The taxi slid gently past him, ignoring him completely; it turned a corner and was gone.Another taxi. Another yellow light that meant the taxi was available. This time Richard stepped out into the middle of the road to flag it down. It swerved past him and continued on its way. Richard began to swear under his breath. Then he ran for the nearest Tube station.He pulled out a pocketful of coins, stabbed the button of the ticket machine for a single ticket to Charing Cross, and thumbed his change into the slot. Every coin he put in went straight through the guts of the machine and clattered into the tray at the bottom. No ticket appeared. He tried another ticket machine, with the same lack of result. And another. The ticket seller in the office was speaking to someone on the telephone when Richard went over to complain and to buy his ticket manually; and despite-or perhaps because of-Richard's cries of ""Hey!"" and ""Excuse me!"" and his desperate tapping on the plastic barrier with a coin, the man remained resolutely on the telephone.""Fuck it,"" announced Richard, and he vaulted the barrier. No one stopped him; no one seemed to care. He ran, breathless and sweating, down the escalator, and made it onto the crowded platform just as a train came in.As a child, Richard had had nightmares in which he simply wasn't there, in which, no matter how much noise he made, no matter what he did, nobody ever noticed him at all. He began to feel like that now, as people pushed in front of him; he was buffeted by the crowd, pushed this way and that by commuters getting off, by others getting on.He persisted, pushing and shoving in his turn, until he was almost on the train-he had one arm inside-when the doors began to hiss closed. He pulled his hand back, but his coat-sleeve was trapped. Richard began to hammer on the door, and to shout, expecting the driver at least to open the door enough for him to free his sleeve. But instead the train began to move off, and Richard was forced to run down the platform, stumbling, faster and faster. He dropped his briefcase onto the platform, pulled desperately at his sleeve with his free hand. The sleeve ripped, and he fell forward, scraping his hand on the platform, ripping his trousers at the knee. Richard climbed, a little unsteadily, to his feet, then walked back down the platform and retrieved his briefcase.He looked at his ripped sleeve and his grazed hand and his torn trousers. Then he walked up the stone stairs and out of the Underground station. Nobody asked him for a ticket on the way out.""I'm sorry I'm late,"" said Richard, to no one in particular in the crowded office. The clock on the office wall said that it was 10:30. He dropped his briefcase on his chair, wiped the sweat from his face with his handkerchief. ""You wouldn't believe what it was like getting here,"" he continued. ""It was a nightmare.""He looked down at his desktop. There was something missing. Or, more precisely, there was everything missing. ""Where are my things?"" he asked the room, a little more loudly. ""Where is my telephone? Where are my trolls?""He checked the desk drawers. They were empty too: not even a Mars bar wrapper or a twisted paper clip to show that Richard had ever been there. Sylvia was coming toward him, in conversation with two rather hefty gentlemen. Richard walked over to her. ""Sylvia? What's going on?""""I'm sorry?"" said Sylvia, politely. She pointed the desk out to the hefty gentlemen, who each took an end of it, and began to carry it out of the office. ""Careful now,"" she told them.""My desk. Where are they taking it?""Sylvia stared at him, gently puzzled. ""And you are . . . ?""/ don't need this shit, thought Richard. ""Richard,"" he said, sarcastically. ""Richard Mayhew.""""Ah,"" said Sylvia. Then her attention slid off Richard, like water off an oiled duck, and she said, ""No, not over there. For heaven's sakes,"" to the removal men, and hurried after them as they carried off Richard's desk.Richard watched her go. Then he walked through the office until he got to Gary's workstation. Gary was answering e-mail. Richard looked at the screen: the e-mail Gary seemed to be writing was both sexually explicit and addressed to someone who was not Gary's girlfriend. Embarrassed, Richard moved around to the other side of the desk.""Gary. What's going on? Is this a joke or something?""Gary looked around, as if he had heard something. He flicked the keyboard, activating a screen-saver of dancing hippopotami, then he shook his head as if to clear it, picked up the telephone, and began to dial. Richard slammed his hand down on the phone, cutting Gary off.""Look, this isn't funny. I don't know what everyone's playing at."" Finally, to his enormous relief, Gary looked up at him. Richard continued, ""If I've been fired then just tell me I've been fired, but all this pretending I'm not here . . . ""And then Gary smiled and said, ""Hi. Yeah. I'm Gary Perunu. Can I help you?""""I don't think so,"" said Richard, coldly, and he walked out of the office, leaving his briefcase behind him.Richard's offices were on the third floor of a big, old, drafty building, just off the Strand. Jessica worked about halfway up a large crystalline, mirrored structure in the City of London, fifteen minutes' walk up the road.Richard jogged up that road. He got to the Stockton building in ten minutes, walked straight past the uniformed security guards on duty on the ground floor, stepped into the elevator, and went up. The inside of the elevator was mirrored, and he stared at himself as he went up. His tie was half-undone and askew, his coat was ripped, his pants torn, his hair was a sweaty mess . . . God, he looked awful.There was a fluting tone, and the elevator door opened. Jessica's floor was quite opulent, in an underdecorated sort of way. There was a receptionist by the elevator, a poised and elegant creature who looked like her take-home pay beat Richard's hands down. She was reading Cosmopolitan. She did not look up as Richard came over.""I need to talk to Jessica Bartram,"" said Richard. ""It's important. I have to speak with her.""The receptionist ignored him, intent upon examining her nails. Richard walked down the corridor until he got to Jessica's office. He opened the door and went in. She was standing in front of three large posters, each advertising ""Angels over England-A Traveling Exhibition,"" each with a different image of an angel on it. She turned as he came in, and she smiled warmly at him.""Jessica. Thank God. Listen, I think I'm going mad or something. It started when I couldn't get a taxi this morning, and then the office and the Tube and-"" He showed her his ragged sleeve. ""It's like I've become some kind of non-person."" She smiled at him some more, reassuringly. ""Look,"" said Richard. ""I'm sorry about the other night. Well, not about what I did, but about upsetting you, and . . . look, I'm sorry, and it's all crazy, and I don't honestly know what to do.""And Jessica nodded, and continued to smile sympathetically, and then she said, ""You're going to think I'm absolutely awful, but I have a really dreadful memory for faces. Give me a second, and I know I'll get it.""And at that point, Richard knew that it was real, and a heavy dread settled in the pit of his stomach. Whatever madness was happening that day was really happening. It was no joke, no trick or prank. ""It's okay,"" he said, dully. ""Forget it.""And he walked away, out the door and down the corridor. He was almost at the lift when she called his name.""Richard!""He turned. It had been a joke. Some kind of petty revenge. Something he could explain. ""Richard . . . Maybury?"" She seemed proud of herself for remembering that much.""Mayhew,"" said Richard, and he got into the elevator, and the doors sang a sad fluting downward trill as they closed behind him.Richard walked back to his flat, upset and confused and angry. Sometimes he would wave at taxis, but never with any real hope that they would stop, and none of them did. His feet hurt, and his eyes stung, and he knew that soon enough he would wake up from today and a proper Monday, a sensible Monday, a decent, honest Monday would begin.When he reached the apartment, he filled the bathtub with hot water, abandoned his clothes on the bed, and, naked, walked through the hall and climbed into the relaxing waters. He had almost dozed off when he heard a key turn, a door open and close, and a smooth male voice say, ""Of course, you're the first I've shown around today, but I've got a list of people as long as your arm who are interested.""""It's not as large as I imagined, from the details your office sent us,"" said a woman.""It's compact, yes. But I like to think of that as a virtue.""Richard had not bothered locking the bathroom door. He was, after all, the only person there.A gruffer, rougher male voice said, ""Thought you said it was an unfurnished apartment. Looks pretty damned furnished to me.""""The previous tenant must have left some of his accoutrements behind. Funny. They never told me anything about that.""Richard stood up in the bathtub. Then, because he was naked, and the people could walk in at any moment, he sat back down. Rather desperately, he looked around the bathroom for a towel. ""Oh look, George,"" said the woman in the hallway. ""Someone's left a towel on this chair.""Richard inspected and rejected as poor towel substitutes a loofah, a half-empty bottle of shampoo, and a small yellow rubber duck. ""What's the bathroom like?"" asked the woman. Richard grabbed a washcloth and draped it in front of his crotch. Then he stood up, with his back to the wall, and prepared to be mortified. The door was pushed open. Three people walked into the bathroom: a young man in a camel-hair coat, and a middle-aged couple. Richard wondered if they were as embarrassed as he was.""It's a bit small,"" said the woman.""Compact,"" corrected the camel-hair coat, smoothly. ""Easy to take care of."" The woman ran her finger along the side of the sink and wrinkled her nose. ""I think we've seen it all,"" said the middle-aged man. They walked out of the bathroom.""It would be very convenient for everything,"" said the woman. A conversation continued in lower tones. Richard climbed out of the bath and edged over to the door. He spotted the towel on the chair in the hall, and he leaned out and grabbed it. ""We'll take it,"" said the woman.""You will?"" said the camel-hair coat.""It's just what we want,"" she explained. ""Or it will be, once we've made it homey. Could it be ready for Wednesday?""""Of course. We'll have all of this rubbish cleaned out of here tomorrow, no problem.""Richard, cold and dripping and wrapped in his towel, glared at them from the doorway. ""It's not rubbish,"" he said. ""It's my stuff.""""We'll pick up the keys from your office, then.""""Excuse me,"" said Richard, plaintively. ""I live here.""They pushed past Richard on their way to the front door. ""Pleasure doing business with you,"" said the camel-hair coat.""Can you . . . can any of you hear me? This is my apartment. I live here.""""If you fax contract details to my office-"" said the gruff man, then the door slammed behind them and Richard stood in the hallway of what used to be his apartment. He shivered, in the silence, from the cold. ""This,"" announced Richard to the world, in direct defiance of the evidence of his senses, ""is not happening."" The Batphone shrilled, and its headlights flashed. Richard picked it up, warily. ""Hello?""The line hissed and crackled as if the call were coming from a long way away. The voice at the other end of the phone was unfamiliar. ""Mister Mayhew?"" it said. ""Mister Richard Mayhew?""""Yes,"" he said. And then, delighted, ""You can hear me. Oh thank God. Who is this?""""My associate and I met you on Saturday, Mister Mayhew. I was enquiring as to the whereabouts of a certain young lady. Do you remember?"" The tones were oily, nasty, foxy.""Oh. Yes. It's you.""""Mister Mayhew. You said Door wasn't with you. We have reason to believe that you were embroidering the truth more than perhaps a little.""""Well, you said you were her brother.""""All men are brothers, Mister Mayhew.""""She's not here anymore. And I don't know where she is.""""We know that, Mister Mayhew. We are perfectly cognizant of both of those facts. And to be magnificently frank, Mister Mayhew-and I'm sure you want me to be frank, don't you?-were I you, I would no longer worry about the young lady. Her days are numbered, and the number in question isn't even in the double digits.""""Why are you calling me?""""Mister Mayhew,"" said Mr. Croup, helpfully, ""do you know what your own liver tastes like?"" Richard was silent. ""Because Mister Vandemar has promised me that he's personally going to cut it out and stuff it into your mouth before he slits your sad little throat. So you'll find out, won't you?""""I'm calling the police. You can't threaten me like this.""""Mister Mayhew. You can call anyone you wish. But I'd hate you to think we were making a threat. Neither myself nor Mister Vandemar make threats, do we Mister Vandemar?""""No? Then what the hell are you doing?""""We're making a promise,"" said Mr. Croup through the static and the echo and the hiss. ""And we do know where you live."" And he hung up.Richard held the phone tightly, staring at it, then he stabbed the nine key three times: Fire, Police, and Ambulance. ""Emergency services,"" said the emergency operator. ""What service do you require?""""Can you put me through to the police, please? A man just threatened to kill me, and I don't think he was joking.""There was a pause. He hoped he was being put through to the police. After a few moments, the voice said, ""Emergency services. Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?"" And then Richard put down the phone, went into his bedroom, and put his clothes on, because he was cold and naked and scared, and there wasn't really anything else he could do.Eventually, and after some deliberation, he took the black sports bag from under the bed and put socks into it. Underpants. Some T-shirts. His passport. His wallet. He was wearing jeans, sneakers, a thick sweater. He remembered the way the girl who called herself Door had said good-bye. The way she had paused, the way she had said she was sorry . . .""You knew,"" he said to the empty apartment. ""You knew this would happen."" He went into the kitchen, took some fruit from the bowl, put that into the bag. Then he zipped it up and walked out onto the darkened street.The ATM took his card with a whirr. PLEASE ENTER YOUR PIN NUMBER, it said. Richard typed in his secret pin number (D-I-C-K). The screen went blank. PLEASE WAIT, it said, and the screen went blank. Somewhere in the depths of the machine something grumbled and growled.THIS CARD IS NOT VALID. PLEASE CONTACT CARD ISSUER. There was a chunking noise, and the card slid out again.""Spare any change?"" said a tired voice from behind him. Richard turned: the man was short and old and balding, his scraggly beard a matted tangle of yellow and gray. The lines of his face were etched deeply in black dirt. He wore a filthy coat over the ruin of a dark gray sweater. His eyes were gray as well, and rheumy.Richard handed the man his card. ""Here,"" he said. ""Keep it. There's about fifteen hundred pounds in there, if you can get to it.""The man took the card in his street-blackened hands, looked at it, turned it over, and said, flatly, ""Thanks a bunch. That and sixty pence'll get me a nice cup of coffee."" He gave Richard his card back, and began to walk down the street.Richard picked up his bag. Then he went after the man and said, ""Hey. Hang on. You can see me.""""Nothing wrong with my eyes,"" said the man.""Listen,"" said Richard, ""have you ever heard of a place called 'The Floating Market'? I need to get there. There's a girl called Door . . . "" But the man had begun, nervously, to back away from Richard. ""Look, I really need help,"" said Richard. ""Please?""The man stared at him, without pity. Richard sighed. ""Okay,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I troubled you."" He turned away, and, clenching the handle of his bag in both hands so that they hardly shook at all, he began to walk down the High Street.""Oy,"" hissed the man. Richard looked back at him. He was beckoning. ""Come on, down here, quickly man."" The man hurried down some steps on the derelict houses at the side of the road-garbage-strewn steps, leading down to abandoned basement apartments. Richard stumbled after him. At the bottom of the steps was a door, which the man pushed open. He waited for Richard to go through, and shut the door behind them. Through the door, they were in darkness. There was a scratch, and the noise of a match flaring into life: the man touched the match to the wick of an old railwayman's lamp, which caught, casting slightly less light than the match had, and they walked together through a dark place.It smelled musty, of damp and old brick, of rot and the dark. ""Where are we?"" Richard whispered. His guide shushed him to silence. They reached another door set in a wall. The man rapped on it rhythmically. There was a pause, and then the door swung open.For a moment, Richard was blinded by the sudden light. He was standing in a huge, vaulted room, an underground hall, filled with firelight and smoke. Small fires burned around the room. Shadowy people stood by the flames, roasting small animals on spits. People scurried from fire to fire. It reminded him of Hell-or rather, the way that he had thought of Hell, as a schoolboy. The smoke irritated his lungs, and he coughed. A hundred eyes turned, then, and stared at him: a hundred eyes, unblinking and unfriendly.A man scuttled toward them. He had long hair, a patchy brown beard, and his ragged clothes were trimmed with fur-orange-and-white-and-black fur, like the coat of a calico cat. He would have been taller than Richard, but he walked with a pronounced stoop, his hands held up at his chest, fingers pressed together. ""What? What is it? What is this?"" he asked Richard's guide. ""Who've you brought us, Iliaster? Talk-talk-talk.""""He's from the Upside,"" said the guide. (Iliaster? thought Richard.) ""Was asking about the Lady Door. And the Floating Market. Brought him to you, Lord Rat-speaker. Figured you'd know what to do with him."" There were now more than a dozen of the fur-trimmed people standing around them, women and men, and even a few children. They moved in scurries: moments of stillness, followed by hasty dashes toward Richard.The Lord Rat-speaker reached inside his fur-trimmed rags and pulled out a wicked-looking sliver of glass, about eight inches long. Some poorly cured fur had been tied around the bottom half of it to form an improvised grip. Firelight glinted from the glass blade. The Lord Rat-speaker put the shard to Richard's throat. ""Oh yes. Yes-yes-yes,"" he cluttered, excitedly. ""I know exactly what to do with him.""
NW_ch4	NW	Neverwhere	4	9711	55963	NeverwhereFOURMr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar had set up their home in the cellar of a Victorian hospital, closed down ten years earlier because of National Health Service budget cutbacks. The property developers, who had announced their intention of turning the hospital into an unparalleled block of unique luxury-living accommodations, had faded away as soon as the hospital had been closed, and so it stood there, year after year, gray and empty and unwanted, its windows boarded up, its doors padlocked shut. The roof was rotten, and rain dripped through the empty hospital's interior, spreading damp and decay through the building. The hospital was ranged around a central well, which let in a certain amount of gray and unfriendly light.The basement world beneath the empty hospital wards comprised more than a hundred tiny rooms, some of them empty, others containing abandoned hospital supplies. One room held a squat, giant metal furnace, while the next room housed the blocked and waterless toilets and showers. Most of the basement floors were covered with a thin layer of oily rainwater, which reflected the darkness and the decay back toward the rotting ceilings.If you were to walk down the hospital steps, as far down as you could go, through the abandoned shower rooms, past the staff toilets, past a room filled with broken glass, where the ceiling had collapsed entirely, leaving it open to the stairwell above, you would reach a small, rusting iron staircase, from which the once-white paint was peeling in long, damp strips. And if you went down the staircase, and traversed the marshy place at the bottom of the steps, and pushed your way through a half-decayed wooden door, you would find yourself in the sub-cellar, a huge room in which a hundred and twenty years of hospital waste had accumulated, been abandoned, and, eventually, forgotten; and it was here that Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar had, for the present, made their home. The walls were damp, and water dripped from the ceiling. Odd things moldered in corners: some of them had once been alive.Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were killing time. Mr. Vandemar had obtained from somewhere a centipede-a reddish orange creature, almost eight inches long, with vicious, poisonous fangs-and was letting it run over his hands, watching it as it twined between his fingers, vanished up one sleeve, appeared a minute later out of the other. Mr. Croup was playing with razor blades. He had found, in a corner, a whole box of fifty-year-old razor blades, wrapped in wax paper, and he had been trying to think of things to do with them.""If I might have your attention, Mister Vandemar,"" he said, at length. ""Pipe your beady eyes on this.""Mr. Vandemar held the centipede's head delicately between a huge thumb and a massive forefinger to stop it wriggling. He looked at Mr. Croup.Mr. Croup put his left hand against a wall, fingers spread. He took five razor blades in his right hand, took careful aim, and threw them at the wall. Each blade stuck into the wall, between Mr. Croup's fingers; it was like a top knife-thrower's act in miniature. Mr. Croup took his hand away, leaving the blades in the wall, outlining the place his fingers had been, and he turned to his partner for approval.Mr. Vandemar was unimpressed. ""What's so clever about that, then?"" he asked. ""You didn't even hit one finger.""Mr. Croup sighed. ""I didn't?"" he said. ""Well, slit my gullet, you're right. How could I have been such a ninny?"" He pulled the razor blades out of the wall, one by one, and dropped them onto the wooden table. ""Why don't you show me how it should have been done?""Mr. Vandemar nodded. He put his centipede back into its empty marmalade jar. Then he put his left hand against the wall. He raised his right arm: his knife, wicked and sharp and perfectly weighted, was in his right hand. He narrowed his eyes, and he threw. The knife flew through the air and thudded into the damp plaster wall blade-first, the blade having first hit and penetrated the back of Mr. Vandemar's hand on its way.A telephone began to ring.Mr. Vandemar looked around at Croup, satisfied, his hand still pinned to the wall. ""That's how it's done,"" he said.There was an old telephone in the corner of the room, an antique, two-part telephone, unused in the hospital since the 1920s, made of wood and Bakelite. Mr, Croup picked up the earpiece, which was on a long, cloth-wrapped cord, and spoke into the mouthpiece, which was attached to the base. ""Croup and Vandemar,"" he said, smoothly, ""the Old Firm. Obstacles obliterated, nuisances eradicated, bothersome limbs removed and tutelary dentistry.""The person at the other end of the phone said something. Mr. Croup cringed. Mr. Vandemar tugged at his left hand. It wasn't coming free.""Oh. Yes, sir. Yes, indeed. And might I say how your telephonic confabulation brightens up and cheers our otherwise dreary and uneventful day?"" Another pause. ""Of course I'll stop toadying and crawling. Delighted to. An honor, and-what do we know? We know that-"" An interruption; he picked his nose, reflectively, patiently, then: ""No, we don't know where she is at this precise moment. But we don't have to. She'll be at the market tonight and-"" His mouth tightened, and, ""We have no intention of violating their market truce. More of waiting till she has left the market and scrobbling her . . . "" He was silent then, and listened, nodding from time to time.Mr. Vandemar tried to pull the knife out of the wall with his free hand, but the knife was stuck quite fast.""That might be arranged, yes,"" said Mr. Croup, into the mouthpiece. ""I mean it will be arranged. Of course. Yes. I realize that. And, sir, perhaps we could talk about-"" But the caller had hung up. Mr. Croup stared at the earpiece for a moment, then put it back on its hook. ""You think you're so damned clever,"" he whispered. Then he noticed Mr. Vandemar's predicament and said, ""Stop that."" He leaned over, pulled the knife out of the wall and out of the back of Mr. Vandemar's hand, and put it down on the table.Mr. Vandemar shook his left hand and flexed the fingers, then wiped the fragments of damp plaster from his knife-blade. ""Who was that?""""Our employer,"" said Mr. Croup. ""It seems the other one isn't going to work out. Not old enough. It's going to have to be the Door female.""""So we aren't allowed to kill her any more?""""That, Mister Vandemar, would be about the short and the long of it, yes. Now, it seems that Little Miss Door has announced that she shall be hiring a bodyguard. At the market. Tonight.""""So?"" Mr. Vandemar spat on the back of his hand, where the knife had gone in, and on the palm of his hand, where the knife had come out. He rubbed at the spit with a massive thumb. The flesh closed, knitted, was whole again.Mr. Croup picked up his old coat, heavy, black, and shiny with age, from the floor. He put it on. ""So, Mister Vandemar,"" he said, ""shall we not also hire ourselves a bodyguard?""Mr. Vandemar slid his knife back into the holster in his sleeve. He put his coat on as well, pushed his hands deep into the pockets, and was pleasantly surprised to find an almost untouched mouse in one pocket. Good. He was hungry. Then he pondered Mr. Croup's last statement with the intensity of an anatomist dissecting his one true love, and, realizing the flaw in his partner's logic, Mr. Vandemar said, ""We don't need a bodyguard, Mister Croup. We hurt people. We don't get hurt.""Mr. Croup turned out the lights. ""Oh, Mister Vandemar,"" he said, enjoying the sound of the words, as he enjoyed the sound of all words, ""if you cut us, do we not bleed?""Mr. Vandemar pondered this for a moment, in the dark. Then he said, with perfect accuracy, ""No.""""A spy from the Upworld,"" said the Lord Rat-speaker. ""Heh? I should slit you from gullet to gizzard and tell fortunes with your guts.""""Look,"" said Richard, his back against the wall, with the glass dagger pressed against his Adam's apple. ""I think you're making a bit of a mistake here. My name is Richard Mayhew. I can prove who I am. I've got my library cards. Credit cards. Things,"" he added, desperately.At the opposite end of the hall, Richard noticed, with the dispassionate clarity that comes when a lunatic is about to slit your throat with a piece of broken glass, people were throwing themselves to the ground, bowing low, and remaining on the floor. A small black shape was coming toward them along the ground. ""I think a moment's reflection might prove that we're all being very silly,"" said Richard. He had no idea what the words meant, just that they were coming out of his mouth, and that as long as he was talking, he was not dead. ""Now, why don't you put that away, and-excuse me, that's my bag,"" this last to a thin, bedraggled girl in her late teens who had taken Richard's bag and was roughly tipping his possessions out onto the ground.The people in the hall continued to bow, and to stay bowed, as the small shape came closer. It reached the group of people around Richard, although not a one of them noticed it. They were all looking at Richard.It was a rat, which looked up at Richard, curiously. He had the bizarre and momentary impression that it winked one of its little black oildrop eyes at him. Then it cluttered, loudly.The man with the glass dagger threw himself on his knees. So did the people gathered around them. So, too, after a moment's hesitation, and a little more awkwardly, did the homeless man, the one they had called Iliaster. In a moment, Richard was the only one standing. The thin girl tugged at his elbow, and he, too, went down on one knee.Lord Rat-speaker bowed so low that his long hair brushed the ground, and he chittered back at the rat, wrinkling his nose, showing his teeth, squeaking and hissing, for all the world like an enormous rat himself.""Look, can anybody tell me . . . "" muttered Richard.""Quiet!"" said the thin girl.The rat stepped-a little disdainfully, it seemed-into the Lord Rat-speaker's grubby hand, and the man held it, respectfully, up in front of Richard's face. It waved its tail languidly as it inspected Richard's features. ""This is Master Longtail, of the clan Gray,"" said the Lord Rat-speaker. ""He says you looks exceeding familiar. He wants to know if he's met you afore.""Richard looked at the rat. The rat looked at Richard. ""I suppose it's possible,"" he admitted.""He says he was discharging an obligation to the marquis de Carabas.""Richard stared at the animal more closely. ""It's that rat? Yes, we've met. Actually, I threw the TV remote, control at it."" Some of the people standing around looked shocked. The thin girl actually squeaked. Richard hardly noticed them; at least something was familiar in this madness. ""Hello, Ratty,"" he said. ""Good to see you again. Do you know where Door is?""""Ratty!"" said the girl in something between a squeak and a horrified swallow. She had a large, water-stained red button pinned to her ragged clothes, the kind that comes attached to birthday cards. It said, in yellow letters, I AM 11.Lord Rat-speaker waved his glass dagger admonishingly at Richard. ""You must not address Master Longtail, save through me,"" he said. The rat squeaked an order. The man's face fell. ""Him?"" he said, looking at Richard disdainfully. ""Look, I can't spare a soul. How about if I simply slice his throat and send him down to the Sewer Folk . . . ""The rat chittered once more, decisively, then leapt from the man's shoulder onto the ground and vanished into one of the many holes that lined the walls.The Lord Rat-speaker stood up. A hundred eyes were fixed on him. He turned back to the hall and looked at his subjects, crouched beside their greasy fires. ""I don't know what you lot are all looking at,"" he shouted. ""Who's turning the spits, eh? You want the grub to burn? There's nothing to see. Go on. Get-get away with the lot of you."" Richard stood up, nervously. His left leg had gotten numb, and he rubbed life into it, as it prickled with pins and needles. Lord Rat-speaker looked at Iliaster. ""He's got to be taken to the market. Master Longtail's orders.""Iliaster shook his head, and spat onto the ground. ""Well, I'm not taking him,"" he said. ""More than my life's worth, that journey. You rat-speakers have always been good to me, but I can't go back there. You know that.""The Lord Rat-speaker nodded. He put his dagger away, in the furs of his robe. Then he smiled at Richard with yellow teeth. ""You don't know how lucky you were, just then,"" he said.""Yes I do,"" said Richard. ""I really do.""""No,"" said the man, ""you don't. You really don't."" And he shook his head and said to himself, marvelling, "" 'Ratty.' ""The Lord Rat-speaker took Iliaster by the arm, and the two of them walked a little way out of earshot and began to talk, darting looks back at Richard as they did so.The thin girl was gulping down one of Richard's bananas in what was, Richard reflected, the least erotic display of banana-eating he had ever seen. ""You know, that was going to be my breakfast,"" said Richard. She looked up at him guiltily. ""My name's Richard. What's yours?""The girl, who, he realized, had already managed to eat most of the fruit that Richard had brought with him, swallowed the last of the banana and hesitated. Then she half-smiled, and said something that sounded a lot like Anaesthesia. ""I was hungry,"" she said.""Well, so'm I,"" he told her.She glanced at the little fires across the room. Then she looked back at Richard. She smiled again. ""Do you like cat?"" she said.""Yes,"" said Richard. ""I quite like cats.""Anaesthesia looked relieved. ""Thigh?"" she asked. ""Or breast?""The girl called Door walked down the court, followed by the marquis de Carabas. There were a hundred other little courts and mews and alleys in London just like this one, tiny spurs of old-time, unchanged for, three hundred years. Even the smell of piss here was the same as it had been in Pepys's time, three hundred years before. There was still an hour until dawn, but the sky was beginning to lighten, turning a stark, leaden color. Strands of mist hung like livid ghosts on the air.The door was roughly boarded up and covered with stained posters for forgotten bands and long-closed nightclubs. The two of them stopped in front of it, and the marquis eyed it, all boards and nails and posters, and he appeared unimpressed; but then, unimpressed was his default state.""So this is the entrance?"" he said.She nodded. ""One of them.""He folded his arms. ""Well? Say 'Open sesame,' or whatever it is that you do.""""I don't want to do this,"" she said. ""I'm really not sure that we're doing the right thing.""""Very well,"" he unfolded his arms. ""I'll be seeing you, then."" He turned on his heel and began to walk back the way that they had come. Door seized his arm. ""You'd abandon me?"" she asked. ""Just like that?""He grinned, without humor. ""Certainly. I'm a very busy man. Things to see. People to do.""""Look, hold on."" She let go of his sleeve, bit her lower lip. ""The last time I was here . . . "" she trailed off.""The last time you were here, you found your family dead. Well, there you are. You don't have to explain it anymore. If we aren't going in, then our business relationship is at an end.""She looked up at him, her elfin face pale in the pre-dawn light. ""And that's all?""""I could wish you the best of luck in your career, but I'm afraid I rather doubt you'll live long enough to have one.""""You're a piece of work, aren't you?""He said nothing. She walked back toward the door. ""Well,"" she said. ""Come on. I'll take us in."" Door put her left hand on the boarded-up door, and with her right hand she took the marquis's huge brown hand. Her tiny fingers twined into his larger ones. She closed her eyes.. . . something whispered and shivered and changed . . .. . . and the door collapsed into darkness.The memory was fresh, only a few days old: Door moved through the House Without Doors calling ""I'm home,"" and ""Hello?"" She slipped from the anteroom to the dining room, to the library, to the drawing room; no one answered. She moved to another room.The swimming pool was an indoor Victorian structure, constructed of marble and of cast iron. Her father had found it when he was younger, abandoned and about to be demolished, and he had woven it into the fabric of the House Without Doors. Perhaps in the world outside, in London Above, the room had long been destroyed and forgotten. Door had no idea where any of the rooms of her house were, physically. Her grandfather had constructed the house, taking a room from here, a room from there, all through London, discrete and doorless; her father had added to it.She walked along the side of the old swimming pool, pleased to be home, puzzled by the absence of her family. And then she looked down.There was someone floating in the water, trailing twin clouds of blood behind him, one from the throat, one from the groin. It was her brother, Arch. His eyes were open wide and sightless. She realized that her mouth was open. She could hear herself screaming.""That hurt,"" said the marquis. He rubbed his forehead, hard, twisted his head around on his neck, as if he were trying to ease a sudden, painful crick.""Memories,"" she explained. ""They're imprinted in the walls.""He raised an eyebrow. ""You could have warned me.""They were in a huge white room. Every wall was covered with pictures. Each picture was of a different room. The white room contained no doors: no openings of any kind. ""Interesting decor,"" acknowledged the marquis.""This is the entrance hall. We can go from here to any room in the House. They are all linked.""""Where are the other rooms located?""She shook her head. ""I don't know. Miles away, probably. They're scattered all over the Underside.""The marquis had managed to cover the whole room in a series of impatient strides. ""Quite remarkable. An associative house, every room of which is located somewhere else. So imaginative. Your grandfather was a man of vision, Door.""""I never knew him."" She swallowed, then continued, talking to herself as much as to him. ""We should have been safe here. Nobody should have been able to hurt us. Only my family could move around it.""""Let's hope your father's journal gives us some clues,"" he said. ""Where do we start looking?"" Door shrugged. ""You're certain he kept a journal?"" he pressed.She nodded. ""He used to go into his study, and private the links until he'd finished dictating.""""We'll start in the study, then.""""But I looked there. I did. I looked there. When I was cleaning up the body . . . "" And she began to cry, in low, raging sobs, that sounded like they were being tugged from inside her.""There. There,"" said the marquis de Carabas, awkwardly, patting her shoulder. And he added, for good measure, ""There."" He did not comfort well.Door's odd-colored eyes were filled with tears. ""Can you . . . can you just give me a sec? I'll be fine."" He nodded and walked to the far end of the room. When he looked back she was still standing there, on her own, silhouetted in the white entrance chamber filled with pictures of rooms, and she was hugging herself, and shuddering, and crying like a little girl.Richard was still upset about the loss of his bag.The Lord Rat-speaker remained unmoved. He stated baldly that the rat-Master Longtail-had said nothing at all about returning Richard's things. Just that he was to be taken to market. Then he told Anaesthesia that she was taking the Upworlder to the market, and that, yes, it was an order. And to stop snivelling, and to get a move on. He told Richard that if he, Lord Rat-speaker, ever saw him, Richard, again, then he, Richard, would be in a great deal of trouble. He reiterated that Richard did not know how lucky he was, and, ignoring Richard's requests that he return Richard's stuff-or at least the wallet-he led them to a door and locked it behind them.Richard and Anaesthesia walked into the darkness side by side.She carried an improvised lamp made of a candle, a can, some wire, and a wide-mouthed glass lemonade bottle. Richard was surprised at how quickly his eyes became used to the near darkness. They seemed to be walking through a succession of underground vaults and storage cellars. Sometimes he thought he could see movement in far corners of the vaults, but whether human, or rat, or something else altogether, it was always gone by the time they reached the place it had been. When he tried to talk to Anaesthesia about the movements, she hissed him to silence.He felt a cold draught on his face. The rat-girl squatted without warning, put down her candle-lamp, and tugged and pulled hard at a metal grille set in the wall. It opened suddenly, sending her sprawling. She motioned Richard to come through. He crouched, edged through the hole in the wall; after about a foot, the floor stopped completely. ""Excuse me,"" whispered Richard. ""There's a hole here.""""It's not a big drop,"" she told him. ""Go on.""She shut the grille behind her. She was now uncomfortably close to Richard. ""Here,"" she said. She gave him the handle of her little lamp to hold, and she clambered down into the darkness. ""There,"" she said. ""That wasn't that bad, was it?"" Her face was a few feet below Richard's dangling feet. ""Here. Pass me the lamp.""He lowered it down to her. She had to jump to take it from him. ""Now,"" she whispered. ""Come on."" He edged nervously forward, climbed over the edge, hung for a moment, then let go. He landed on his hands and feet in soft, wet mud. He wiped the mud off his hands onto his sweater. A few feet forward, and Anaesthesia was opening another door. They went through it, and she pulled it closed behind them. ""We can talk now,"" she said. ""Not loud. But we can. If you want to.""""Oh. Thanks,"" said Richard. He couldn't think of anything to say. ""So. Um. You're a rat, are you?"" he said.She giggled, like a Japanese girl, covering her hand with her face as she laughed. Then she shook her head, and said, ""I should be so lucky. I wish. No, I'm a rat-speaker. We talk to rats.""""What, just chat to them?""""Oh no. We do stuff for them. I mean,"" and her tone of voice implied that this was something that might never have occurred to Richard unassisted, ""there are some things rats can't do, you know. I mean, not having fingers, and thumbs, an' things. Hang on-"" She pressed him against the wall, suddenly, and clamped a filthy hand over his mouth. Then she blew out the candle.Nothing happened.Then he heard distant voices. They waited, in the darkness and the cold. Richard shivered.People walked past them, talking in low tones. When all sounds had died away, Anaesthesia took her hand from Richard's mouth, relit the candle, and they walked on. ""Who were they?"" asked Richard.She shrugged. ""It dun't matter,"" she said.""Then what makes you think that they wouldn't have been pleased to see us?""She looked at him rather sadly, like a mother trying to explain to an infant that, yes this flame was hot, too. All flames were hot. Trust her, please. ""Come on,"" she said. ""I know a shortcut. We can nip through London Above for a bit."" They went up some stone steps, and the girl pushed open a door. They stepped through, and the door shut behind them.Richard looked around, puzzled. They were standing on the Embankment, the miles-long walkway that the Victorians had built along the north shore of the Thames, covering the drainage system and the newly created District Line of the Underground, and replacing the stinking mudflats that had festered along the banks of the Thames for the previous five hundred years. It was still night-or perhaps it was night once more. He was unsure how long they had been walking through the underplaces and the dark.There was no moon, but the night sky was a riot of crisp and glittering autumn stars. There were streetlights too, and lights on buildings and on bridges, which looked like earthbound stars, and they glimmered, repeated, as they were reflected with the city in the night water of the Thames. It's fairyland, thought Richard.Anaesthesia blew out her candle. And Richard said, ""Are you sure this is the right way?""""Yes,"" she said. ""Pretty sure.""They were approaching a wooden bench, and the moment he set eyes on it, it seemed to Richard that that bench was one of the most desirable objects he had ever seen. ""Can we sit down?"" he asked. ""Just for a minute.""She shrugged. They sat down at opposite ends of the bench. ""On Friday,"" said Richard, ""I was with one of the finest investment analyst firms in London.""""What's a investment an' a thing?""""It was my job.""She nodded, satisfied. ""Right. And . . . ?""""Just reminding myself, really. Yesterday . . . it was like I didn't exist anymore, to anybody up here.""""That's 'cos you don't,"" explained Anaesthesia. A late-night couple, who had been slowly walking along the Embankment toward them, holding hands, sat down in the middle of the bench, between Richard and Anaesthesia, and commenced to kiss each other, passionately. ""Excuse me,"" said Richard to them. The man had his hand inside the woman's sweater and was moving it around enthusiastically, a lone traveler discovering an unexplored continent. ""I want my life back,"" Richard told the couple.""I love you,"" said the man to the woman.""But your wife-"" she said, licking the side of his face.""Fuck her,"" said the man.""Don' wanna fuck her,"" said the woman, and she giggled, drunkenly. ""Wanna fuck you . . . "" She put a hand on his crotch and giggled some more.""Come on,"" said Richard to Anaesthesia, feeling that the bench had started to become a less desirable neighborhood. They got up and walked away. Anaesthesia peered back, curiously, at the couple on the bench, who were gradually becoming more horizontal.Richard said nothing. ""Something wrong?"" asked Anaesthesia.""Only everything,"" said Richard. ""Have you always lived down there?""""Nah. I was born up here,"" she hesitated. ""You don't want to hear about me."" Richard realized, almost surprised, that he really did.""I do. Really.""She fingered the rough quartz beads that hung in a necklace around her neck, and she swallowed. ""There was me and my mother and the twins . . . "" she said, and then she stopped talking. Her mouth clamped shut.""Go on,"" said Richard. ""It's all right. Really it is. Honest.""The girl nodded. She took a deep breath, and then she began to talk, without looking at him as she talked, her eyes fixed on the ground ahead of her. ""Well, my mother had me an' my sisters, but she got a bit funny in the head. One day I got home from school, and she was crying and crying, and she didn't have any clothes on, and she was breaking stuff. Plates and stuff. But she never hurt us. She never did. The lady from the social services came and took the twins away, an' I had to go and stay with my aunt. She was living with this man. I didn't like him. And when she was out of the house . . . "" The girl paused; she was quiet for so long that Richard wondered if she had finished. Then she began once more, ""Anyway. He used to hurt me. Do other stuff. In the end, I told my aunt, an' she started hitting me. Said I was lying. Said she'd have the police on me. But I wasn't lying. So I run away. It was my birthday.""They had reached the Albert Bridge, a kitsch monument spanning the Thames, joining Battersea to the south with the Chelsea end of the Embankment, a bridge hung with thousands of tiny white lights.""I didn't have anywhere to go. And it was so cold,"" said Anaesthesia, and she stopped again. ""I slept on the streets. I'd sleep in the day, when it was a bit warmer, and walk around at night, just to keep moving. I was only eleven. Stealing bread an' milk off people's doorsteps to eat. Hated doing that so I started hanging around the street markets, taking the rotten apples an' oranges an' things people threw away. Then I got really sick. I was living under an overpass in Notting Hill. When I come to, I was in London Below. The rats had found me.""""Have you ever tried to return to all this?"" he asked, gesturing. Quiet, warm, inhabited houses. Late-night cars. The real world . . . she shook her head. All fire burns, little baby. You'll learn. ""You can't. It's one or the other. Nobody ever gets both.""""I'm sorry,"" said Door, hesitantly. Her eyes were red, and she looked as if she had been vigorously blowing her nose and scrubbing her tears from her eyes and cheeks.The marquis had been amusing himself while he waited for her to collect herself by playing a game of knucklebones with some old coins and bones he kept in one of the many pockets of his coat. He looked up at her coldly. ""Indeed?""She bit her lower lip. ""No. Not really. I'm not sorry. I've been running and hiding and running so hard that . . . this was the first chance I've really had to . . . "" she stopped.The marquis swept up the coins and the bones, and returned them to their pocket. ""After you,"" he said. He followed her back to the wall of pictures. She put one hand on the painting of her father's study and took the marquis's large black hand with the other.. . . reality twisted . . .They were in the conservatory, watering the plants. First Portia would water a plant, directing the flow of the water toward the soil at the base of the plant, avoiding the leaves and the blossoms. ""Water the shoes,"" she said to her youngest daughter. ""Not the clothes.""Ingress had her own little watering can. She was so proud of it. It was just like her mother's, made of steel, painted bright green. As her mother finished with each plant, Ingress would water it with her tiny watering can. ""On the shoes,"" she told her mother. She began laughing, then, spontaneous little-girl laughter.And her mother laughed too, until foxy Mr. Croup pulled her hair back, hard and sudden, and cut her white throat from ear to ear.""Hello, Daddy,"" said Door, quietly.She touched the bust of her father with her fingers, stroking the side of his face. A thin, ascetic man, almost bald. Caesar as Prospero, thought the marquis de Carabas. He felt a little sick. That last image had hurt. Still: he was in Lord Portico's study. That was a first.The marquis took in the room, eyes sliding from detail to detail. The stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling; the leather-bound books, an astrolabe, convex and concave mirrors, odd scientific instruments; there were maps on the walls, of lands and cities de Carabas had never heard of; a desk, covered in handwritten correspondence. The white wall behind the desk was marred by a reddish-brown stain. There was a small portrait of Door's family on the desk. The marquis stared at it. ""Your mother and your sister, your father, and your brothers. All dead. How did you escape?"" he asked.She lowered her hand. ""I was lucky. I'd gone off exploring for a few days . . . did you know there are still some Roman soldiers camped out by the Kilburn River?""The marquis had not known this, which irritated him. ""Hmm. How many?""She shrugged. ""A few dozen. They were deserters from the Nineteenth Legion, I think. My Latin's a bit patchy. Anyway, when I got back here . . . "" She paused, swallowed, her opal-colored eyes brimming with tears.""Pull yourself together,"" said the marquis, shortly. ""We need your father's journal. We have to find out who did this.""She frowned at him. ""We know who did this. It was Croup and Vandemar-""He opened a hand, waggled his fingers as he spoke. ""They're arms. Hands. Fingers. There's a head that ordered it, that wants you dead, too. Those two don't come cheap."" He looked around the cluttered office. ""His journal?"" said the marquis.""It's not here,"" she said. ""I told you. I looked.""""I was under the misapprehension that your family was skilled in locating doors, both obvious and otherwise.""She glowered at him. Then she closed her eyes and put her finger and thumb on each side of the bridge of her nose. Meanwhile, the marquis examined the objects on Portico's desk. An inkwell; a chess-piece; a bone die; a gold pocket-watch; several quill-feathers and . . .Interesting.It was a small statue of a boar, or a crouching bear, or perhaps a bull. It was hard to tell. It was the size of a large chess-piece, and it had been roughly carved out of black obsidian. It reminded him of something, but of what he could not say. He picked it up casually, turned it over, curled his fingers around it.Door lowered her hand from her face. She looked puzzled and confused. ""What's the matter?"" he asked.""It is here,"" she said, simply. She began to walk through the study, head turning first to one side and then to the other. The marquis slipped the carving discreetly into an inside pocket.Door stood before a high cabinet. ""There,"" she said. She reached out a hand: there was a click, and a small panel in the side of the cabinet swung open. Door reached into the darkness and removed something roughly the size and shape of a small cannon-ball. She passed it to the marquis. It was a sphere, constructed of old brass and polished wood, inset with polished copper and glass lenses. He took it from her.""This is it?""She nodded.""Well done.""She looked grave. ""I don't know how I could have missed it before.""""You were upset,"" said the marquis. ""I was certain it would be here. And I am so rarely wrong. Now . . . "" he held the little wooden globe up. The light caught the polished glass and glinted from the brass and copper fittings. It galled him to admit ignorance about anything, but he said it anyway. ""How does this work?""Anaesthesia led Richard into a small park on the south side of the bridge, then down some stone steps, set beside a wall. She relit her candle-in-a-bottle, and then she opened a workman's door and closed it behind them. They went down some steps, with the darkness all around them.""There's a girl named Door,"" said Richard. ""She's a bit younger than you. Do you know her?""""The Lady Door. I know who she is.""""So which, um, barony is she part of?""""No barony. She's of the House of the Arch. Her family used to be very important.""""Used to be? Why did they stop?""""Somebody killed them.""Yes, he remembered the marquis saying something about that, now. A rat cut across their path. Anaesthesia stopped on the steps and performed a deep curtsey. The rat paused. ""Sire,"" she said, to the rat. ""Hi,"" said Richard. The rat looked at them for a heartbeat, then it darted off down the steps. ""So,"" said Richard. ""What is a floating market?""""It's very big,"" she said. ""But rat-speakers hardly ever need to go to the market. To tell the truth-"" She hesitated. ""Nah. You'll laugh at me.""""I won't,"" said Richard, honestly.""Well,"" said the thin girl. ""I'm a little scared.""""Scared? Of the market?""They had reached the bottom of the steps. Anaesthesia hesitated and then turned left. ""Oh. No. There's a truce in the market. If anyone hurt anyone there, the whole of London Below would be down on them like a ton of sewage.""""So what are you scared of?""""Getting there. They hold it in a different place every time. It moves around. And to get to the place it'll be tonight . . . "" she fingered the quartz beads around her neck, nervously. ""We'll have to go through a really nasty neighborhood."" She did sound scared.Richard suppressed the urge to put an arm around her. ""And where would that be?"" he asked. She turned to him, pushed the hair from her eyes, and told him.""Knightsbridge,"" repeated Richard, and he began to chuckle, gently.The girl turned away. ""See?"" she said. ""I said you'd laugh.""The deep tunnels had been dug in the 1920s, for a high-speed extension to the Northern Line of London's Underground Railway system. During the Second World War troops had been quartered there in the thousands, their waste pumped up by compressed air to the level of the sewers far above. Both sides of the runnels had been lined with metal bunk beds for the troops to sleep on. When the war ended the bunk beds had stayed, and on their wire bases cardboard boxes were stored, each box filled with letters and files and papers: secrets, of the dullest kind, stored down deep, to be forgotten. The need for economy had closed the deep tunnels completely in the early 1990s. The boxes of secrets were removed, to be scanned and stored on computers, or shredded, or burned.Varney made his home in the deepest of the deep tunnels, far beneath Camden Town Tube. He had piled abandoned metal bunk beds in front of the only entrance. Then he had decorated. Varney liked weapons. He made his own, out of whatever he could find, or take, or steal, parts of cars and rescued bits of machinery, which he turned into hooks and shivs, crossbows and arbalests, small mangonels and trebuchets for breaking walls, cudgels, glaives and knob-kerries. They hung on the wall of the deep runnel, or sat in corners, looking unfriendly. Varney looked like a bull might look, if the bull were to be shaved, dehorned, covered in tattoos, and suffered from complete dental breakdown. Also, he snored. The oil lamp next to his head was turned down low. Varney slept on a pile of rags, snoring and snuffling, with the hilt of a homemade two-bladed sword on the ground beside his hand.A hand turned up the oil lamp.Varney had the two-bladed sword in his hand, and he was on his feet almost before his eyes were open. He blinked, stared around him. There was no one there: nothing had disturbed the pile of bunk beds blocking the door. He began to lower the sword.A voice said, ""Psst.""""Hh?"" said Varney.""Surprise,"" said Mr. Croup, stepping into the light.Varney took a step back: a mistake. There was a knife at his temple, the point of the blade next to his eye. ""Further movements are not recommended,"" said Mr. Croup, helpfully. ""Mister Vandemar might have a little accident with his old toad-sticker. Most accidents do occur in the home. Is that not so, Mister Vandemar?""""I don't trust statistics,"" said Mr. Vandemar's blank voice. A gloved hand reached down from behind Varney, crushed his sword, and dropped the twisted thing to the floor.""How are you, Varney?"" asked Mr. Croup. ""Well, we trust? Yes? In fine form, fetlock and fettle for the market tonight? Do you know who we are?""Varney did the nearest thing he could to a nod that didn't actually involve moving any muscles. He knew who Croup and Vandemar were. His eyes were searching the walls. Yes, there: the morning-star: a spiked wooden ball, studded with nails, on a chain, in the far corner of the room . . .""There is talk that a certain young lady will be auditioning bodyguards this evening. Had you thought of trying out for the task?"" Mr. Croup picked at his tombstone teeth. ""Enunciate clearly."" Varney picked up the morning-star with his mind. It was his Knack. Gentle, now . . . slowly . . . He edged it off the hook and pulled it up toward the top of the tunnel arch . . . With his mouth, he said, ""Varney's the best bravo and guard in the Underside. They say I'm the best since Hunter's day.""Varney mentally positioned the morning-star in the shadows above and behind Mr. Croup's head. He would crush Croup's skull first, then he'd take Vandemar . . .The morning-star plunged toward Mr. Croup's head: Varney flung himself down, away from the knife-blade at his eye. Mr. Croup did not look up. He did not turn. He simply moved his head, obscenely fast, and the morning-star crashed past him, into the floor, where it threw up chips of brick and concrete. Mr. Vandemar picked Varney up with one hand. ""Hurt him?"" he asked his partner.Mr. Croup shook his head: not yet. To Varney, he said, ""Not bad. So, 'best bravo and guard,' we want you to get yourself to the market tonight. We want you to do whatever you have to, to become that certain young lady's personal bodyguard. Then, when you get the job, one thing you don't forget. You may guard her from the rest of the world, but when we want her, we take her. Got it?""Varney ran his tongue over the wreck of his teeth. ""Are you bribing me?"" he asked.Mr. Vandemar had picked up the morning-star. He was pulling the chain apart, with his free hand, link by link, and dropping the bits of twisted metal onto the floor. Chink. ""No,"" said Mr. Vandemar. Chink. ""We're intimidating you."" Chink. ""And if you don't do what Mister Croup says, we're . . . "" chink "" . . . hurting you . . . "" chink "" . . . very badly, before we're . . . "" chink "" . . . killing you.""""Ah,"" said Varney. ""Then I'm working for you, aren't I?""""Yes, you are,"" said Mr. Croup. ""I'm afraid we don't have any redeeming features.""""That doesn't bother me,"" said Varney.""Good,"" said Mr. Croup. ""Welcome aboard.""It was a large but elegant mechanism, built of polished walnut and oak, of brass and glass, copper and mirrors and carved and inlaid ivory, of quartz prisms and brass gears and springs and cogs. The whole thing was rather larger than a wide-screen television, although the actual screen itself was no more than six inches across. A magnifying lens placed across it increased the size of the picture. There was a large brass horn coming out of the side-the kind you could find on an antique gramophone. The whole mechanism looked rather like a combined television and video player might look, if it had been invented and built three hundred years ago by Sir Isaac Newton. Which was, more or less, exactly what it was.""Watch,"" said Door. She placed the wooden ball onto a platform. Lights shone through the machine and into the ball. It began to spin around and around,A patrician face appeared on the small screen, vividly colored. Slightly out of time, a voice came from the horn, crackling in mid-speech. "" . . . that two cities should be so near,"" said the voice, ""and yet in all things so far; the possessors above us, and the dispossessed, we who live below and between, who live in the cracks.""Door stared at the screen, her face unreadable."" . . . still,"" said her father, ""I am of the opinion that what cripples us, who inhabit the Underside, is our petty factionalism. The system of baronies and fiefdoms is both divisive and foolish."" The Lord Portico was wearing a threadbare old smoking jacket and a skullcap. His voice seemed to be coming to them across the centuries, not days or weeks. He coughed. ""I am not alone in this belief. There are those who wish to see things the way they are. There are others who want the situation to worsen. There are those . . . """"Can you speed it up?"" asked the marquis. ""Find the last entry?""Door nodded. She touched an ivory lever at the side: the image ghosted, fragmented, re-formed.Now Portico wore a long coat. His skullcap was gone. There was a scarlet gash down one side of his head. He was no longer sitting at his desk. He was talking urgently, quietly. ""I do not know who will see this, who will find this. But whoever you are, please take this to my daughter, the Lady Door, if she lives . . . "" A static burst wiped across the picture and the sound. Then, ""Door? Girl, this is bad. I don't know how long I've got before they find this room. I think my poor Portia and your brother and sister are dead."" The sound and picture quality began to degrade.The marquis glanced at Door. Her face was wet: tears were brimming from her eyes, glistening down her cheeks. She seemed unaware that she was crying, made no attempt to wipe away the tears. She just stared at her father's image, listened to his words. Crackle. Wipe. Crackle. ""Listen to me, girl,"" said her dead father. ""Go to Islington . . . you can trust Islington . . . You must believe in Islington . . . "" He ghosted. Blood dripped from his forehead into his eyes. He he wiped it off. ""Door? Avenge us. Avenge your family.""A loud bang came from the gramophone horn. Portico turned his head to look offscreen, puzzled and nervous. ""What?"" he said, and he stepped out of frame. For a moment, the picture remained unchanged: the desk, the blank white wall behind it. Then an arc of vivid blood splashed across the wall. Door flicked a lever on the side, blanking the screen, and turned away.""Here."" The marquis passed her a handkerchief.""Thanks."" She wiped her face, blew her nose vigorously. Then she stared into space. Eventually, she said, ""Islington.""""I've never had any dealings with Islington,"" said the marquis.""I thought it was just a legend,"" she said.""Not at all."" He reached across the desk, picked up the gold pocket-watch, thumbed it open. ""Nice workmanship,"" he observed.She nodded. ""It was my father's.""He closed the cover with a click. ""Time to go to market. It starts soon. Mister Time is not our friend.""She blew her nose once more, put her hands deep into the pockets of her leather jacket. Then she turned to him, elfin face frowning, odd-colored eyes bright. ""Do you honestly think we can find a bodyguard who will be able to deal with Croup and Vandemar?""The marquis flashed his white teeth at her. ""There's been no one since Hunter who'd even have a chance. No, I'll settle for someone who could give you the time you might need to get away."" He fastened the fob of the watch chain to his waistcoat, slid the watch into his vest pocket.""What are you doing?"" asked Door. ""That's my father's watch.""""He's not using it anymore, is he?"" He adjusted the golden chain. ""There. That looks rather elegant."" He watched the emotions flicker across her face: quiet anger and, finally, resignation.""We'd better go,"" was all she said.""The Bridge isn't very far now,"" said Anaesthesia. Richard hoped that was true. They were now on their third candle. The walls flickered and oozed, the passageway seemed to stretch on forever. He was astonished that they were still under London: he was half-convinced that they had walked most of the way to Wales.""I'm really scared,"" she continued. ""I've never crossed the bridge before.""""I thought you said you'd been to this market already,"" he asked, mystified.""It's the Floating Market, silly. I told you already. It moves. Different places. Last one I went to was held in that big clock tower. Big . . . someone. And the next was-""""Big Ben?"" he suggested.""Maybe. We were inside where all the big wheels went around, and that was where I got this-"" She held up her necklace. The candlelight glimmered yellow off the shiny quartz. She smiled, like a child. ""Do you like it?"" she asked.""It's great. Was it expensive?""""I swapped some stuff for it. That's how things work down here. We swap stuff."" And then they turned a corner, and saw the bridge. It could have been one of the bridges over the Thames, five hundred years ago, thought Richard; a huge stone bridge spanning out over a vast black chasm, into the night. But there was no sky above it, no water below. It rose into darkness. Richard wondered who had built it, and when. He wondered how something like this could exist, beneath the city of London, without everyone knowing. He felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He was, he realized, deeply, pathetically scared of the bridge itself.""Do we have to go across it?"" he asked. ""Can't we get to the market some other way?"" They paused at the base of the bridge.Anaesthesia shook her head. ""We can get to the place it's in,"" she said. ""But the market wouldn't be there.""""Huh? But that's ridiculous. I mean, something's either there or it's not. Isn't it?""She shook her head. There was a buzz of voices from behind them, and someone pushed Richard to the ground. He looked up: a huge man, crudely tattooed, dressed in improvised rubber and leather clothes that looked like they had been cut out of the inside of cars, stared back down at him, dispassionately. Behind the huge man were a dozen others, male and female: people who looked like they were on their way to a particularly low-rent costume party. ""Somebody,"" said Varney, who was not in a good mood, ""was in my way. Somebody ought to watch where he's going.""Once, as a small boy walking home from school, Richard had encountered a rat in a ditch by the side of the road. When the rat saw Richard it had reared up onto its hind legs and hissed and jumped, terrifying Richard. He backed away marvelling that something so small had been so willing to fight something so much larger than itself. Now Anaesthesia stepped between Richard and Varney. She was less than half his size, but she glared at the big man and bared her teeth, and she hissed like an angry rat at bay. Varney took a step backwards. He spat at Richard's shoes. Then he turned away, and, taking the knot of people with him, he walked across the bridge and into the dark.""Are you all right?"" asked Anaesthesia, helping Richard back to his feet.""I'm fine,"" he said. ""That was really brave of you.""She looked down, shyly. ""I'm not really brave,"" she said. ""I'm still scared of the bridge. Even they were scared. That was why they all went over together. Safety in numbers.""""If you are crossing the bridge, I will go with you,"" said a female voice, rich as cream and honey, coming from behind them. Richard was not able to place her accent. He turned, and standing there was a tall woman, with long, tawny hair, and skin the color of burnt caramel. She wore dappled leather clothes, mottled in shades of gray and brown. She had a battered leather duffel bag over her shoulder. She was carrying a staff, and she had a knife at her belt and an electric flashlight strapped to her wrist. She was also, without question, the most beautiful woman that Richard had ever seen.""Safety in numbers. You're welcome to come with us,"" he said, after a moment's hesitation. ""My name's Richard Mayhew. This is Anaesthesia. She's the one us who knows what she's doing."" The rat-girl preened.The leather woman looked him up and looked him down. ""You're from London Above,"" she told him.""Yes."" As lost as he was in this strange other-world, he was at least learning to play the game. His mind was too numb to make any sense of where he was, or why he was here, but it was capable of following the rules.""Travelling with a rat-speaker. My word.""""I'm his guardian,"" said Anaesthesia, truculently. ""Who are you? Who do you owe fealty to?""The woman smiled. ""I owe no man fealty, rat-girl. Have either of you crossed Night's Bridge before?"" Anaesthesia shook her head. ""Well. Isn't this going to be fun?""They walked toward the bridge. Anaesthesia handed Richard her candle-lamp. ""Here,"" she said.""Thanks."" Richard looked at the woman in leather. ""Is there anything, really, to be scared of?""""Only the night on the bridge,"" she said.""The kind in armor?""""The kind that comes when day is over."" Anaesthesia's hand sought Richard's. He held it tightly, her tiny hand in his. She smiled at him, squeezed his hand. And then they set foot on Night's Bridge and Richard began to understand darkness: darkness as something solid and real, so much more than a simple absence of light. He felt it touch his skin, questing, moving, exploring: gliding through his mind. It slipped into his lungs, behind his eyes, into his mouth . . .With each step they took the light of the candle became dimmer. He realized the same thing was happening to the leather woman's flashlight. It felt not so much as if the lights were being turned down but as if the darkness were being turned up. Richard blinked, and opened his eyes on nothing-nothing but darkness, complete and utter. Sounds. A rustling, a squirming. Richard blinked, blinded by the night. The sounds were nastier, hungrier. Richard imagined he could hear voices: a horde of huge, misshapen trolls, beneath the bridge . . .Something slithered past them in the dark. ""What's that?"" squeaked Anaesthesia. Her hand was shaking in his.""Hush,"" whispered the woman. ""Don't attract its attention.""""What's happening?"" whispered Richard.""Darkness is happening,"" said the leather woman, very quietly. ""Night is happening. All the nightmares that have come out when the sun goes down, since the cave times, when we huddled together in fear for safety and for warmth, are happening. Now,"" she told them, ""now is the time to be afraid of the dark."" Richard knew that something was about to creep over his face. He closed his eyes: it made no difference to what he saw or felt. The night was complete. It was then that the hallucinations started.He saw a figure falling toward him through the night, burning, its wings and hair on fire.He threw up his hands: there was nothing there.Jessica looked at him, with contempt in her eyes. He wanted to shout to her, tell her he was sorry.Place one foot after another.He was a small child, walking home from school, at night, down the one road with no streetlights. No matter how many times he did it, it never got any easier, never got any better.He was deep in the sewers, lost in a labyrinth. The Beast was waiting for him. He could hear a slow drip of water. He knew the Beast was waiting. He gripped his spear . . . Then a rumbling bellow, deep in its throat, from behind him. He turned. Slowly, agonizingly slowly, it charged at him, through the dark.And it charged.He died.And kept walking.Slowly, agonizingly slowly, it charged at him, over and over, through the dark.There was a sputter, and a flare so bright it hurt, making Richard squint and stagger. It was the candle flame, in its lemonade-bottle holder. He had never known how brightly a single candle could burn. He held it up, gasping and gulping and shaking with relief. His heart was pounding and shuddering in his chest.""We would appear to have crossed successfully,"" said the leather woman.Richard's heart was pounding in his chest so hard that, for a few moments, he was unable to talk. He forced himself to breathe slowly, to calm down. They were in a large anteroom, exactly like the one on the other side. In fact, Richard had the strange feeling that it was the same room they had just left. Yet the shadows were deeper, and there were after-images floating before Richard's eyes, like those one saw after a camera flash. ""I suppose,"" Richard said, haltingly, ""we weren't in any real danger . . . It was like a haunted house. A few noises in the dark . . . and your imagination does the rest. There wasn't really anything to be scared of, was there?""The woman looked at him, almost pityingly; and Richard realized that there was nobody holding his hand. ""Anaesthesia?""From the darkness at the crown of the bridge came a gentle noise, like a rustle or a sigh. A handful of irregular quartz beads pattered down the curve of the bridge toward them. Richard picked one up. It was from the rat-girls necklace. His mouth opened, but no sound came out. Then he found his voice. ""We'd better. We have to go back. She's . . . ""The woman raised her flashlight, shone it across the bridge. Richard could see all the way across the bridge. It was deserted. ""Where is she?"" he asked.""Gone,"" said the woman, flatly. ""The darkness took her.""""We've got to do something,"" said Richard urgently.""Such as?""Once again, he opened his mouth. This time, he found no words. He closed it again. He fingered the lump of quartz, looked at the others on the ground.""She's gone,"" said the woman. ""The bridge takes its toll. Be grateful it didn't take you too. Now if you're going to the market, it's through here, up this way."" She gestured toward a narrow passageway that rose up into the dimness in front of them, barely illuminated by the beam of her flashlight.Richard did not move. He felt numb. He found it hard to believe that the rat girl was gone-lost, or stolen, or strayed, or . . . -and harder to believe that the leather woman was able to carry on as if nothing at all out of the ordinary had happened-as if this were utterly usual. Anaesthesia could not be deadHe completed the thought. She could not be dead, because if she were, then it was his fault. She had not asked to go with him. He held the quartz bead so tightly it hurt his hand, thinking of the pride with which Anaesthesia had shown it to him, of how fond he had become of her in the handful of hours that he had known her.""Are you coming?""Richard stood there in the darkness for a few pounding heartbeats, then he placed the quartz bead gently into the pocket of his jeans. He followed the woman, who was still some paces ahead of him. As he followed her, he realized that he still did not know her name.
NW_ch5	NW	Neverwhere	5	7383	42684	NeverwhereFIVEPeople slipped and slid through the darkness about them, holding lamps, torches, flashlights, and candles. It made Richard think of documentary films he had seen of schools of fish, glittering and darting through the ocean . . . Deep water, inhabited by things that had lost the use of their eyes.Richard followed the leather woman up some steps. Stone steps, edged with metal. They were in an Underground station. They joined a line of people waiting to slip through a grille, which had been opened a foot or so to uncover the door, which led out onto the pavement.Immediately in front of them were a couple of young boys, each with a string tied around his wrist. The strings were held by a pallid, bald man, who smelled of formaldehyde. Immediately behind them in the line waited a gray-bearded man with a black-and-white kitten sitting on his shoulder. It washed itself, intently licked the man's ear, then curled up on his shoulder and went to sleep. The line moved slowly, as, one by one, the figures at the end slipped through the space between the grille and the wall and edged into the night. ""Why are you going to the market, Richard Mayhew?"" asked the leather woman, in a low voice. Richard still could not place her accent: he was beginning to suspect that she was African or Australian-or perhaps she came from somewhere even more exotic and obscure.""I have friends I'm hoping to meet there. Well, just one friend. I don't actually know many people from this world. I was sort of getting to know Anaesthesia, but . . . "" he trailed off. Asked the question he had not dared to voice until this moment. ""Is she dead?""The woman shrugged. ""Yes. Or as good as. I trust your visit to the market will make her loss worthwhile.""Richard shivered. ""I don't think it could,"" he said. He felt empty, and utterly alone. They were approaching the front of the line. ""What do you do?"" he asked.She smiled. ""I sell personal physical services.""""Oh,"" he said. ""What kind of personal physical services?"" he asked.""I rent my body."" She did not elaborate.""Ah."" He was too weary to pursue it, to press her to explain just what she meant; he had an idea, though. And then they stepped out into the night. Richard looked back. The sign on the station said KNIGHTSBRIDGE. He didn't know whether to smile or to mourn. It felt like the small hours of the morning. Richard looked down at his watch and was not surprised to notice that the digital face was now completely blank. Perhaps the batteries had died, or, he thought, more likely, time in London Below had only a passing acquaintance with the kind of time he was used to. He did not care. He unstrapped the watch and dropped it into the nearest garbage can.The odd people were crossing the road in a stream, walking through the double doors facing them. ""There?"" he said, appalled.The woman nodded. ""There.""The building was large, and it was covered with many thousands of burning lights. Conspicuous coats of arms on the wall facing them proudly proclaimed that it sold all sorts of things by appointment to various members of the British Royal Family. Richard, who had spent many a footsore weekend hour trailing behind Jessica through every prominent shop in London, recognized it immediately, even without the huge sign, proclaiming it to be, ""Harrods?""The woman nodded. ""Only for tonight,"" she said. ""The next market could be anywhere.""""But I mean,"" said Richard. ""Harrods."" It seemed almost sacrilegious to be sneaking into this place at night.They walked in through the side door. The room was dark. They passed the bureau de change and the gift-wrapping section, through another darkened room selling sunglasses and figurines, and then they stepped into the Egyptian Room. Color and light broke over Richard like a wave hitting the shore. His companion turned to him: she yawned, catlike, shading the vivid pinkness of her mouth with the back of her caramel hand. And then she smiled, and said, ""Well. You're here. Safe and, more or less, sound. I have business to attend to. Fare you well."" She nodded curtly and slipped away into the crowd.Richard stood there, alone in the throng, drinking it in. It was pure madness-of that there was no doubt at all. It was loud, and brash, and insane, and it was, in many ways, quite wonderful. People argued, haggled, shouted, sang. They hawked and touted their wares, and loudly declaimed the superiority of their merchandise. Music was playing-a dozen different kinds of music, being played a dozen different ways on a score of different instruments, most of them improvised, improved, improbable. Richard could smell food. All kinds of food-the smells of curries and spices seemed to predominate, with, beneath them, the smells of grilling meats and mushrooms. Stalls had been set up all throughout the shop, next to, or even on, counters that, during the day, had sold perfume, or watches, or amber, or silk scarves. Everybody was buying. Everybody was selling. Richard listened to the market cries as he began to wander through the crowds.""Lovely fresh dreams. First-class nightmares. We got 'em. Get yer lovely nightmares here.""""Weapons! Arm yourself! Defend your cellar, cave, or hole! You want to hit 'em? We got 'em. Come on darling, come on over here . . . """"Rubbish!"" screamed a fat, elderly woman, in Richard's ear, as he passed her malodorous stall. ""Junk!"" she continued. ""Garbage! Trash! Offal! Debris! Come and get it! Nothing whole or undamaged! Crap, tripe, and useless piles of shit. You know you want it.""A man in armor beat a small drum and chanted, ""Lost Property. Roll up, roll up, and see for yourself. Lost property. None of your found things here. Everything guaranteed properly lost.""Richard wandered through the huge rooms of the store, like a man in a trance. He was unable to even guess how many people there were at the night market. A thousand? Two thousand? Five thousand?One stall was piled high with bottles, full bottles and empty bottles of every shape and every size, from bottles of booze to one huge glimmering bottle that could have contained nothing but a captive djinn; another sold lamps with candles, made of many kinds of wax and tallow; a man thrust what appeared to be a child's severed hand clutching a candle toward him as he passed, muttering, ""Hand of Glory, sir? Send 'em up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire. Guaranteed to work."" Richard hurried past, not wishing to find out what a Hand of Glory was, nor how it worked; he passed a stall selling glittering gold and silver jewelry, another selling jewelry made from what looked like the valves and wires of antique radios; there were stalls that sold every manner of book and magazine; others that sold clothes-old clothes patched, and mended, and made strange; several tattooists; something that he was almost certain was a small slave market (he kept well clear of this); a dentist's chair, with a hand-operated manual drill, with a line of miserable people standing beside it, waiting to have their teeth pulled or filled by a young man who seemed to be having altogether too good a time; a bent old man selling unlikely things that might have been hats and might have been modern art; something that looked very much like a portable shower facility; even a blacksmith's . . .And every few stalls there would be somebody selling food. Some of them had food cooking over open fires: curries, and potatoes, and chestnuts, and huge mushrooms, and exotic breads. Richard found himself wondering why the smoke from the fires didn't set off the building's sprinkler system. Then he found himself wondering why no one was looting the store: why set up their own little stalls? Why not just take things from the shop itself? He knew better, at this point, than to risk asking anyone . . . He seemed marked as a man from London Above, and thus worthy of great suspicion.There was something deeply tribal about the people, Richard decided. He tried to pick out distinct groups: there were the ones who looked like they had escaped from a historical reenactment society; the ones who reminded him of hippies; the albino people in gray clothes and dark glasses; the polished, dangerous ones in smart suits and black gloves; the huge, almost identical women who walked together in twos and threes, and nodded when they saw each other; the tangle-haired ones who looked like they probably lived in sewers and who smelled like hell; and a hundred other types and kinds . . .He wondered how normal London-his London-would look to an alien, and that made him bold. He began to ask them, as he went, ""Excuse me? I'm looking for a man named de Carabas and a girl called Door. Do you know where I'd find them?"" People shook their heads, apologized, averted their eyes, moved away.Richard took a step back and stepped on someone's foot. Someone was well over seven feet tall, and was covered in tufty ginger-colored hair. Someone's teeth had been sharpened to points. Someone picked Richard up with a hand the size of a sheep's head, and put Richard's head so close to someone's mouth that Richard almost gagged. ""I'm really sorry,"" said Richard. ""I-I'm looking for a girl named Door. Do you know-"" But someone dropped him onto the floor and moved on.Another whiff of cooking food wafted across the floor, and Richard, who had managed to forget how hungry he was ever since he had declined the prime cut of tomcat-he could not think how many hours before-now found his mouth watering, and his thinking processes beginning to grind to a halt.The iron-haired woman running the next food stall he approached did not reach to Richard's waist. When Richard tried to talk to her, she shook her head, drew a finger across her lips. She could not talk, or did not talk, or did not want to talk. Richard found himself conducting the negotiations for a cottage cheese and lettuce sandwich and a cup of what looked and smelled like home-brewed lemonade, in sign language. His food cost him a ballpoint pen, and a book of matches he had forgotten he had. The little woman must have felt that she had got by far the better of the deal, for, as he took his food, she threw in a couple of small, nutty cookies.Richard stood in the middle of the throng, listening to the music-someone was, for no reason that Richard could easily discern, singing the lyrics of ""Greensleeves"" to the tune of ""Yakkety-Yak""-watching the bizarre bazaar unfold around him, and eating his sandwiches.As he finished the last of the sandwiches, he realized that he had no idea how anything he had just eaten had tasted; and he resolved to slow down, and chew the cookies more slowly. He sipped the lemonade, making it last. ""You need a bird, sir?"" asked a cheery voice, close at hand. ""I got rooks and ravens, crows and starlings. Fine, wise birds. Tasty and wise. Brilliant.""Richard said, ""No, thank you"" and turned around.The hand-painted sign above the stall said:OLD BAILEY'S BIRDS AND INFORMATIONThere were other, smaller, signs scattered about:YOU WANTS IT, WE KNOWS IT, and YOU WON'T FIND A PLUMPER STARLING!!!! and WHEN IT'S TIME FOR A ROOK, IT'S TIME FOR OLD BAILEY!! Richard found himself thinking of the man he had seen when he had first come to London, who used to stand outside Leicester Square Tube station with a huge hand-painted sandwich board that exhorted the world to ""Less Lust Through Less Protein, Eggs, Meat, Beans, Cheese and Sitting.""Birds hopped and fluttered about small cages that looked as if they had been woven out of TV antennae. ""Information, then?"" continued Old Bailey, warming to his own sales-pitch. ""Roof-maps? History? Secret and mysterious knowledge? If I don't knows it, it's probably better forgot. That's what I says."" The old man still wore his feathered coat, was still wrapped about with ropes and cords. He blinked at Richard, then pulled on the pair of spectacles tied about his neck with string. He inspected Richard carefully through them. ""Hang on-I knows you. You was with the marquis de Carabas. On the rooftops. Remember? Eh? I'm Old Bailey. Remember me?"" He thrust out his hand, pumped Richard's hand furiously.""Actually,"" said Richard, ""I'm looking for the marquis. And for a young lady named Door. I think they're probably together.""The old man did a little jig, causing several feathers to detach themselves from his coat; this provoked a chorus of raucous disapproval from the various birds around them. ""Information! Information!"" he announced to the crowded room. ""See? I told 'em. Diversify, I said. Diversify! You can't sell rooks for the stewpot forever-anyway, they taste like boiled slipper. And they're so stupid. Thick as custard. You ever eaten rook?"" Richard shook his head. That was something he could be certain of, at any rate. ""What'll you give me?"" asked Old Bailey.""Sorry?"" said Richard, awkwardly leaping from ice floe to ice floe in the stream of the old man's consciousness.""If'n I give ye your information. What'll I get?""""I don't have any money,"" said Richard. ""And I just gave my pen away.""He began to pull out the contents of Richard's pockets. ""There,"" said Old Bailey. ""That!""""My hankie?"" asked Richard. It was not a particularly clean handkerchief; it had been a present from his Aunt Maude, on his last birthday. Old Bailey seized it and waved it above his head, happily.""Never you fear, laddie,"" he sang, triumphantly. ""Your quest is at an end. Go down there, through that door. You can't miss them. They're auditioning."" He was pointing towards Harrods' extensive network of Food Halls. A rook cawed maliciously. ""None of your beak,"" said Old Bailey, to the rook. And, to Richard, he said, ""Thank'ee for the little flag."" He jigged around his stall, delighted, waving Richard's handkerchief to and fro.Auditioning? thought Richard. And then he smiled. It didn't matter. His quest, as the mad old roof-man had put it, was at an end. He walked toward the Food Halls.Fashion, in bodyguards, seemed to be everything. They all had a Knack of one kind or another, and each of them was desperate to demonstrate it to the world. At the moment, Ruislip was facing off against the Fop With No Name.The Fop With No Name looked somewhat like an early eighteenth-century rake, one who hadn't been able to find real rake clothes and had had to make do with what he could find at the Salvation Army store. His face was powdered to white, his lips painted red. Ruislip, the Fop's opponent, resembled a bad dream one might have if one fell asleep watching sumo wrestling on the television with a Bob Marley record playing in the background. He was a huge Rastafarian who looked like nothing so much as an obese and enormous baby.They were standing face to face, in the middle of a cleared circle of spectators and other bodyguards and sightseers. Neither man moved a muscle. The Fop was a good head taller than Ruislip. On the other hand, Ruislip looked as if he weighed as much as four fops, each of them carrying a large leather suitcase entirely filled with lard. They stared at each other, without breaking eye contact.The marquis de Carabas tapped Door on the shoulder and pointed. Something was about to happen.One moment there were two men standing impassively, just looking at each other, then the Fop's head rocked back, as if he'd just been hit in the face. A small, reddish purple bruise appeared on his cheek. He pursed his lips and fluttered his eyelashes. ""La,"" he said, then stretched his rouged lips wide, in a ghastly parody of a smile.The Fop gestured. Ruislip staggered, and clutched his stomach.The Fop With No Name smirked outrageously, waggled his fingers, and blew kisses to several spectators. Ruislip stared angrily at the Fop, redoubling his mental assault. Blood began to drip from the Fop's lips. His left eye started to swell. He staggered. The audience muttered appreciatively.""It's not as impressive as it looks,"" whispered the marquis to Door.The Fop With No Name stumbled, suddenly, going onto his knees, as if someone were forcing him down, and fell, awkwardly, to the floor. Then he jerked, as if someone had just kicked him, hard, in the stomach. Ruislip looked triumphant. The spectators clapped, politely. The Fop writhed and spat blood onto the sawdust on the floor of Harrods' Fish and Meat Hall. He was dragged off into the corner by some friends, and was violently sick.""Next,"" said the marquis.The next would-be bodyguard was again thinner than Ruislip (being about the size of two and a half fops, carrying but a single suitcase filled with lard between them). He was covered in tattoos and dressed in clothes that looked like they had been stitched together from old car seats and rubber mats. He was shaven-headed, and he sneered at the world through rotten teeth. ""I'm Varney,"" he said, and he hawked, and spat green on the sawdust. He walked into the ring.""When you're ready, gentlemen,"" said the marquis.Ruislip stamped his bare feet on the floor, sumo-like, one-two, one-two, and commenced to stare hard at Varney. A small cut opened on Varney's forehead, and blood began to drip from it into one eye. Varney ignored it; and instead appeared to be concentrating on his right arm. He pulled his arm up slowly, like a man fighting a great deal of pressure. Then he slammed his fist into Ruislip's nose, which began to spurt blood. Ruislip drew one long, horrible breath, and hit the ground with the sound of half a ton of wet liver being dropped into a bathtub. Varney giggled.Ruislip slowly pulled himself back to his feet blood from his nose soaking his mouth and chest, dripping onto the sawdust. Varney wiped the blood from his forehead and bared his ruined mouth at the world in an appalling grin. ""Come on,"" he said. ""Fat bastard. Hit me again.""""That one's promising,"" muttered the marquis.Door raised an eyebrow. ""He doesn't look very nice.""""Nice in a bodyguard,"" lectured the marquis, ""is about as useful as the ability to regurgitate whole lobsters. He looks dangerous."" There was a murmur of appreciation, then, as Varney did something rather fast and painful to Ruislip, something that involved the sudden connection of Varney's leather-bound foot and Ruislip's testicles. The murmur was the kind of restrained and deeply unenthusiastic applause one normally only hears in England on sleepy sunny Sunday afternoons, at village cricket matches. The marquis clapped politely with the rest of them. ""Very good, sir,"" he said.Varney looked at Door, and he winked at her, almost proprietarily, before he returned his attention to Ruislip. Door shivered.Richard heard the clapping and walked toward it.Five almost identically dressed, pale young women walked past him. They wore long dresses made of velvet, each dress as dark as night, one each of dark green, dark chocolate, royal blue, dark blood, and pure black. Each woman had black hair and wore silver jewelry; each was perfectly coifed, perfectly made up. They moved silently: Richard was aware only of a swish of heavy velvet as they went past, a swish that sounded almost like a sigh. The last of the women, the one dressed in utter black, the palest and the most beautiful, smiled at Richard. He smiled back at her, warily. Then he walked on toward the audition.It was being held in the Fish and Meat Hall, on the open area of floor beneath Harrods' fish sculpture. The audience had their back to him, were standing two or three people deep. Richard wondered if he would easily be able to find Door and the marquis: and then the crowd parted, and he saw them both, sitting on the glass top of the smoked-salmon counter. He opened his mouth to shout out Door's name; and as he did so, he realized why the crowd had parted, as an enormous dreadlocked man, naked but for a green, yellow, and red cloth wrapped like a diaper around his middle, came catapulting through the crowd, as if tossed by a giant, landing squarely on top of him.""Richard?"" she said.He opened his eyes. The face swam in and out of focus. Fire opal-colored eyes, peering into his, from a pale, elfin face.""Door?"" he said.She looked furious; she looked beyond fury. ""Temple and Arch, Richard. I don't believe it. What are you doing here?""""It's nice to see you, too,"" said Richard, weakly. He sat up and wondered if he was suffering from a concussion. He wondered how he'd know if he was, and he wondered why he had ever thought that Door would have been pleased to see him. She stared intently at her nails, nostrils flaring, as if she did not trust herself to say anything else.The big man with the very bad teeth, the man who had knocked Richard over on the bridge, was fighting with a dwarf. They were fighting with crowbars, and the fight was not as unequal as one might have imagined. The dwarf was preternaturally fast: he rolled, he struck, he bounced, he dove; his every movement made Varney appear lumbering and awkward by comparison.Richard turned to the marquis, who was watching the fight intently. ""What is happening?"" he asked.The marquis spared him a glance, and then returned his gaze to the action in front of them. ""You,"" he said, ""are out of your league, in deep shit, and, I would imagine, a few hours away from an untimely and undoubtedly messy end. We, on the other hand, are auditioning bodyguards."" Varney connected his crowbar with the dwarf, who instantly stopped bouncing and darting, and instantly began lying insensible. ""I think we've seen enough,"" said the marquis, loudly. ""Thank you all. Mister Varney, if you could wait behind?""""Why did you have to come here?"" Door said to Richard, frostily.""I didn't really have much choice,"" said Richard.She sighed. The marquis was walking around the perimeter, dismissing the various bodyguards who had already auditioned, distributing a few words of praise here, of advice there. Varney waited patiently, off to one side. Richard essayed a smile at Door. It was ignored. ""How did you get to the market?"" she asked.""There are these rat people-"" Richard began.""Rat-speakers,"" she said.""And you see, the rat who brought us the marquis's message-""""Master Longtail,"" she said.""Well, he told them they had to get me here.""She raised an eyebrow, cocked her head slightly on one side. ""A rat-speaker brought you here?""He nodded. ""Most of the way. Her name was Anaesthesia. She . . . well, something happened to her. On the bridge. This other lady brought me the rest of the way here. I think she was a . . . you know."" He hesitated, then said it. ""Hooker.""The marquis had returned. He stood in front of Varney, who looked obscenely pleased with himself. ""Weapons expertise?"" asked the marquis.""Whew,"" said Varney. ""Put it like this. If you can cut someone with it, blow someone's head off with it, break a bone with it, or make a nasty hole in someone with it, then Varney's the master of it.""""Previous satisfied employers include?""""Olympia, the Shepherd Queen, the Crouch Enders. I done security for the May Fair for a bit, as well.""""Well,"" said the marquis de Carabas. ""We're all very impressed with your skill.""""I had heard,"" said a female voice, ""that you had put out a call for bodyguards. Not for enthusiastic amateurs."" Her skin was the color of burnt caramel, and her smile would have stopped a revolution. She was dressed entirely in soft mottled gray and brown leathers. Richard recognized her immediately.""That's her,"" Richard whispered to Door. ""The hooker.""""Varney,"" said Varney, affronted, ""is the best guard and bravo in the Underside. Everyone knows that.""The woman looked at the marquis. ""You've finished the trials?"" she asked.""Yes,"" said Varney.""Not necessarily,"" said the marquis.""Then,"" she told him. ""I would like to audition."" There was a beat before the marquis de Carabas said, ""Very well,"" and stepped backward.Varney was undoubtedly dangerous, not to mention a bully, a sadist, and actively harmful to the physical health of those around him. What he was not, though, was particularly quick on the uptake. He stared at the marquis as the penny dropped, and dropped, and kept on dropping. Finally, in disbelief, he asked, ""I have to fight her?""""Yes,"" said the leather woman. ""Unless you'd like a little nap, first."" Varney began to laugh: a manic giggle. He stopped laughing a moment later, when the woman kicked him, hard, in the solar plexus, and he toppled like a tree.Near his hand, on the floor, was the crowbar he had used in the fight with the dwarf. He grabbed it, slammed it into the woman's face-or would have, had she not ducked out of the way. She clapped her open hands onto his ears, very fast. The crowbar went flying across the room. Still reeling from the pain in his ears, Varney pulled a knife from his boot. He was not entirely sure what happened after that: only that the world swung out from under him, and then he was lying, face down, on the ground, with blood coming from his ears, and his own knife at his throat, while the marquis de Carabas was saying, ""Enough!""The woman looked up, still holding Varney's knife to his throat. ""Well?"" she said.""Very impressive,"" said the marquis. Door nodded.Richard was thunderstruck: it had been like watching Emma Peel, Bruce Lee, and a particularly vicious tornado, all rolled into one and sprinkled with a generous helping of a mongoose killing a king cobra. That was how she had moved. That was how she had fought.Richard normally found displays of real violence unnerving. But he found watching this woman in action exhilarating, as if she were finding a part of him he had not known existed. It seemed utterly right, in this unreal mirror of the London he had known, that she should be here and that she should be fighting so dangerously and so well.She was part of London Below. He understood that now. And as he thought that, he thought about London Above, and a world in which no one fought like this-no one needed to fight like this-a world of safety and of sanity and, for a moment, the homesickness engulfed him like a fever.The woman looked down at Varney. ""Thank you, Mister Varney,"" she said, politely. ""I'm afraid we won't be needing your services after all."" She got off him, and put his knife away in her belt.""And you are called?"" asked the marquis.""I'm called Hunter,"" she said.Nobody said anything. Then Door spoke, hesitantly, ""The Hunter?""""That's right,"" said Hunter, and she brushed the dust of the floor from her leather leggings. ""I'm back.""From somewhere a bell sounded, twice, a deep bonging noise that made Richard's teeth vibrate. ""Five minutes,"" muttered the marquis. Then he said, to the remains of the crowd, ""I think we've found our bodyguard. Thank you all very much. Nothing more to see.""Hunter walked over to Door, and looked her up and down. ""Can you stop people from killing me?"" asked Door. Hunter inclined her head toward Richard. ""I saved his life three times today, crossing the bridge, coming to the market.""Varney, who had stumbled to his feet, picked up the crowbar with his mind. The marquis watched him do it; he said nothing.The ghost of a smile hovered about Door's lips. ""That's funny,"" she said. ""Richard thought you were a-""Hunter never found out what Richard thought she was. The bar came hurtling toward her head. She simply reached out a hand and caught it: it thwapped, satisfyingly, into the palm of her hand.She walked over to Varney. ""Is this yours?"" she asked. He bared his teeth at her, yellow and black and brown. ""Right now,"" said Hunter, ""we're under Market Truce. But if you try something like that again, I'll waive the truce, and I'll break off both your arms and make you carry them home in your teeth. Now,"" she continued, bending his wrist behind his back, ""say sorry, nicely.""""Ow,"" said Varney.""Yes?"" she said, encouragingly.He spat it out as if it were choking him. ""I'm sorry."" She let him go. Varney backed away to a safe distance, plainly scared and furious, watching Hunter. When he reached the door to the Food Halls, he hesitated, and shouted, ""You're dead. You're fucking dead, you are!"" in a voice that hovered on the edge of tears, and then he turned, and he ran from the room.""Amateurs,"" sighed Hunter.They walked back through the store the way that Richard had come. The bell he had heard was now tolling deeply and continually. When they came upon it, he saw that it was a huge brass bell, suspended on a wooden frame, with a rope suspended from the clapper. It was being tolled by a large black man, wearing the black robes of a Dominican monk, and it had been set up next to Harrods' gourmet jelly bean stand.Impressive as the market had been to watch, Richard found the speed at which it was being dismantled, broken down, and put away even more impressive. All evidence that it had ever been there was vanishing: stalls were being taken apart, loaded onto people's backs, hauled off into the streets. Richard noticed Old Bailey, his arms filled with his crude signs and with bird cages, stumbling out of the store. The old man waved happily at Richard and vanished off into the night.The crowds thinned, the market vanished, and almost instantly the ground floor of Harrods looked as usual, as sedate, elegant, and clean as any time he had walked around it in Jessica's wake on a Saturday afternoon. It was as if the market had never existed.""Hunter,"" said the marquis. ""I've heard of you, of course. Where have you been, all this time?""""Hunting,"" she said, simply. Then, to Door. ""Can you take orders?""Door nodded. ""If I have to.""""Good. Then maybe I can keep you alive,"" said Hunter. ""If I take the job.""The marquis stopped. His eyes flickered over her, distrustfully. ""You said, if you take the job . . . ?""Hunter opened the door, and they stepped out onto the pavement of London at night. It had rained while they had been at the market, and the streetlights now glimmered on the wet tarmac. ""I've taken it,"" said Hunter.Richard stared at the glistening street. It all seemed so normal, so quiet, so sane. For a moment, he felt that all he needed to get his life back would be to hail a taxi and tell it to take him home. And then he would sleep the night through in his own bed. But a taxi would not see him or stop for him, and he had nowhere to go, even if one did.""I'm tired,"" he said.No one said anything. Door would not meet his eyes, the marquis was cheerfully ignoring him, and Hunter was treating him as an irrelevance. He felt like a small child, unwanted, following the bigger children around, and that made him irritated. ""Look,"" he said, clearing his throat, ""I know you are all very busy people. But what about me?""The marquis turned and stared at him, eyes huge and white in his dark face. ""You?"" he said. ""What about you?""""Well,"" said Richard. ""How do I get back to normal again? It's like I've walked into a nightmare. Last week everything made sense, and now nothing makes sense . . . "" He trailed off. Swallowed. ""I want to know how to get my life back,"" he explained.""You won't get it back traveling with us, Richard,"" said Door. ""It's going to be hard enough for you anyway. I . . . I really am sorry.""Hunter, in the lead, knelt down on the pavement. She took a small metal rod from her belt and used it to unlock the cover to a sewer. She pulled up the sewer cover, looked into it warily, climbed down, then ushered Door into the sewer. Door did not look at Richard as she went down. The marquis scratched the side of his nose. ""Young man,"" he said, ""understand this: there are two Londons. There's London Above-that's where you lived-and then there's London Below-the Underside-inhabited by the people who fell through the cracks in the world. Now you're one of them. Good night.""He began to climb down the sewer ladder. Richard said, ""Wait,"" and caught the sewer cover before it could close. He followed the marquis down. It smelled like drains at the top of the sewer-a dead, soapy, cabbagey smell. He expected it to get worse as he went down, but instead the smell quickly dissipated as he approached the floor of the sewer. Gray water ran, shallow but fast, along the bottom of the brick tunnel. Richard stepped into it. He could see the lights of the others up ahead, and he ran and splashed down the tunnel until he caught up with them.""Go away,"" said the marquis.""No,"" he said.Door glanced up at him. ""I am really sorry, Richard,"" she said.The marquis stepped between Richard and Door. ""You can't go back to your old home or your old job or your old life,"" he said to Richard, almost gently. ""None of those things exist. Up there, you don't exist."" They had reached a junction: a place where three tunnels came together. Door and Hunter set off along one of them, the one that was empty of water, and they did not look back. The marquis lingered.""You'll just have to make the best of it down here,"" he said to Richard, ""in the sewers and the magic and the dark."" And then he smiled, hugely, whitely: a gleaming grin, monumental in its insincerity. ""Well-delightful to see you again. Best of luck. If you can survive for the next day or two,"" he confided, ""you might even make it through a whole month."" And with that he turned and strode off through the sewer, after Door and Hunter.Richard leaned against a wall and listened to their footsteps, echoing away, and to the rush of the water running past on its way to the pumping stations of East London, and the sewage works. ""Shit,"" he said. And then, to his surprise, for the first time since his father died, alone in the dark, Richard Mayhew began to cry.The Underground station was quite empty, and quite dark. Varney walked through it, keeping close to walls, darting nervous looks behind him, and in front of him, and from side to side. He had picked the station at random, had headed for it over the rooftops and through the shadows, making certain that he was not being followed. He was not heading back to his lair in the Camden Town deep tunnels. Too risky. There were other places where Varney had cached weapons and food. He would go to ground for a little while, until this all blew over.He stopped beside a ticket machine and listened, in the darkness: absolute silence. Reassured that he was alone, he allowed himself to relax. He stopped at the top of the spiral staircase and drew a deep breath.An oily voice from beside him said conversationally, ""Varney's the finest bravo and guard in the Underside. Everyone knows that. Mister Varney told us so himself."" A voice from the other side of him responded, dully, ""It's not nice to lie, Mister Croup.""In the pitch darkness, Mr. Croup expanded on his theme. ""It isn't, Mister Vandemar. I have to say, I regard it as a personal betrayal, and I was deeply wounded by it. And disappointed. When you don't have any redeeming features, you don't take particularly kindly to disappointment, do you, Mister Vandemar?""""Not kindly at all, Mister Croup.""Varney threw himself forward, and ran, headlong, in the dark, down the spiral staircase. A voice from the top of the stairs, Mr. Croup's: ""Really,"" it said, ""we ought to look upon it as a mercy killing.""The sound of Varney's feet clattered off the metal railings, echoed throughout the stairwell. He puffed, and he panted, his shoulders glancing off the walls, tumbling blindly downwards in the dark. He reached the bottom of the steps, next to the sign warning travelers that there were 259 steps up to the top, and only healthy people should even think about attempting it. Everyone else, suggested the sign, should use the elevator.The elevator?Something clanked, and the elevator doors opened, magnificently slowly, flooding the passageway with light. Varney fumbled for his knife: cursed, when he realized the Hunter-bitch still had it. He reached for the machete in his shoulder sheath. It was gone.He heard a polite cough behind him, and he turned.Mr. Vandemar was sitting on the steps, at the bottom of the spiral staircase. He was picking his fingernails with Varney's machete.And then Mr, Croup fell upon him, all teeth and talons and little blades; and Varney never had a chance to scream. ""Bye,"" said Mr. Vandemar, impassively, and he continued paring his nails. After that the blood began to flow. Wet, red blood in enormous quantities, for Varney was a big man, and he had been keeping it all inside. When Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were finished, however, one would have been hard put even to notice the slight stain on the floor at the bottom of the spiral staircase.The next time the floors were washed, it was gone forever.Hunter was in the lead. Door walked in the middle. The marquis de Carabas took up the rear. None of them had said a word since leaving Richard half an hour earlier.Door stopped, suddenly. ""We can't do this,"" she said, flatly. ""We can't leave him back there.""""Of course we can,"" said the marquis. ""We did.""She shook her head. She had felt guilty and stupid ever since she saw Richard, lying on his back beneath Ruislip, at the audition. She was tired of it.""Don't be foolish,"" said the marquis.""He saved my life,"" she told him. ""He could have left me on the sidewalk. He didn't.""It was her fault. She knew that was true. She had opened a door to someone who could help her, and help her he had. He had taken her somewhere warm, and he had cared for her, and he had brought her help. The action of helping her had tumbled him from his world into hers.It was foolish to even think about bringing him with them. They could not afford to bring someone with them: she was unsure that the three of them would be able to take care of themselves on the journey that confronted them.She wondered, briefly, if it were simply the door that she had opened, that had taken her to him, which had allowed him to notice her, or if there were, somehow, more to it than that.The marquis raised an eyebrow: he was detached, removed, a creature of pure irony. ""My dear young lady,"" he said. ""We are not bringing a guest along on this expedition.""""Don't patronize me, de Carabas,"" said Door. She was so tired. ""And I think I can decide who comes with us. You are working for me, aren't you? Or is it the other way around?"" Her sorrow and exhaustion had drained her of her patience. She needed de Carabas-she couldn't afford to drive him away- but she had reached her limit.De Carabas stared at her, coldly angry. ""He is not coming with us,"" he stated, flatly. ""Anyway, he's probably dead by now.""Richard was not dead. He was sitting in the dark, on a ledge, on the side of a storm drain, wondering what to do, wondering how much further out of his league he could possibly get. His life so far, he decided, had prepared him perfectly for a job in Securities, for shopping at the supermarket, for watching soccer on the television on the weekends, for turning up the thermostat if he got cold. It had magnificently failed to prepare him for a life as an un-person on the roofs and in the sewers of London, for a life in the cold and the wet and the dark.A light glimmered. Footsteps came toward him. If, he decided, it was a bunch of murderers, cannibals, or monsters, he would not even put up a fight. Let them end it all for him; he'd had enough. He stared down into the dark, to the place where his feet should be. The footsteps came closer.""Richard?"" The voice was Door's. He jumped. Then he studiously ignored her. If it weren't for you, he thought . . . ""Richard?""He didn't look up. ""What?"" he said.""Look,"" she said. ""You really wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for me,"" You can say that again, he thought. ""And I don't think you'll be any safer with us. But. Well."" She stopped. A deep breath. ""I'm sorry. I really am. Are you coining?""He looked at her then: a small creature with huge eyes staring at him urgently from a heart-shaped, pale face. Okay, he said to himself. I guess I'm not quite ready to just give up and die. ""Well, I don't have anywhere else to be right now,"" he said, with a studied unconcern that bordered on hysteria. ""Why not?""Her face changed. She threw her arms around his chest and hugged him, tightly. ""And we will try to get you back home again,"" she said. ""Promise. Once we've found what I'm looking for."" He wondered if she meant it, suspected, for the first time, that what she was offering might be impossible. But he pushed that thought out of his head. They began to walk down the tunnel. Richard could see Hunter and the marquis waiting for them at the tunnel's mouth. The marquis looked as if he had been forced to swallow a pulped lemon.""What are you looking for, anyway?"", asked Richard, cheering up a little.Door took a deep breath, and answered after a long pause. ""It's a long story,"" she said, solemnly. ""Right now we're looking for an angel named Islington."" It was then that Richard began to laugh; he couldn't help himself. There was hysteria in there, certainly, but there was also the exhaustion of someone who had managed, somehow, to believe several dozen impossible things in the last twenty-four hours, without ever getting a proper breakfast. His laughter echoed down the tunnels.""An angel?"" he said, giggling helplessly. ""Called Islington?""""We've got a long way to go,"" said Door.And Richard shook his head, and felt wrung out, and emptied, and flayed. ""An angel,"" he whispered, hysterically, to the tunnels and the dark. ""An angel.""There were candles all over the Great Hall: candles stood by the iron pillars that held the roof up; candles waited by the waterfall that ran down one wall and into the small rock-pool below; candles clustered on the sides of the rock wall; candles huddled on the floor; candles were set into candlesticks by the huge door that stood between two dark iron pillars. The door was built of polished black flint set into a silver base that had tarnished, over the centuries, almost to black. The candles were unlit; but as the tall form walked past, they flickered into flame. No hand touched them; no fires touched their wicks.The figure's robe was simple, and white; or more than white. A color, or an absence of all colors, so bright as to be startling. Its feet were bare on the cold rock floor of the Great Hall. Its face was pale and wise, and gentle; and, perhaps, a little lonely.It was very beautiful.Soon every candle in the Hall was burning. It paused by the rock-pool; knelt beside the water, cupped its hands, lowered them into the clear water, raised them, and drank. The water was cold, but very pure. When it had finished drinking the water it closed its eyes for a moment, as if in benediction. Then it stood up, and walked away, back through the Hall, the way it had come; and the candles went out as it passed, as they had done for tens of thousands of years. It had no wings; but still, it was, unmistakably, an angel.Islington left the Great Hall; and the last of the candles went out, and the darkness returned.
NW_ch6	NW	Neverwhere	6	3832	22166	NeverwhereSIXRichard wrote a diary entry in his head.Dear Diary, he began. On Friday I had a job, a fiancee, a home, and a life that made sense. (Well, as much as any life makes sense.) Then I found an injured girl bleeding on the pavement, and I tried to be a Good Samaritan. Now I've got no fiancee, no home, no job, and I'm walking around a couple of hundred feet under the streets of London with the projected life expectancy of a suicidal fruit fly. ""This way,"" said the marquis, gesturing elegantly, his filthy lace cuff flowing.""Don't all these tunnels look the same?"" asked Richard, tabling his diary entry for the moment. ""How can you tell which is which?""""You can't,"" said the marquis, sadly. ""We're hopelessly lost. We'll never be seen again. In a couple of days we'll be killing each other for food.""""Really?"" He hated himself for rising to the bait, even as he said it.""No."" The marquis's expression said that torturing this poor fool was too easy to even be amusing. Richard found that he cared less and less what these people thought of him, however. Except, perhaps, for Door.He went back to writing his mental diary. There are hundreds of people in this other London. Thousands maybe. People who come from here, or people who have fallen through the cracks. I'm wandering around with a girl called Door, her bodyguard, and her psychotic grand vizier. We slept last night in a small tunnel that Door said was once a section of Regency sewer. The bodyguard was awake when I went to sleep, and awake when they woke me up. I don't think she ever sleeps. We had some fruitcake for breakfast; the marquis had a large lump of it in his pocket. Why would anyone have a large lump of fruitcake in his pocket? My shoes dried out mostly while I slept.I want to go home. Then he mentally underlined the last sentence three times, rewrote it in huge letters in red ink, and circled it before putting a number of exclamation marks next to it in his mental margin.At least the tunnel they were now walking down was dry. It was a high-tech tunnel: all silvery pipes and white walls. The marquis and Door walked together, in front. Richard tended to stay a couple of paces behind them. Hunter moved about: sometimes she was behind them, sometimes to one side of them or to the other, often a little way in front, merging with the shadows. She made no sound when she moved, which Richard found rather disconcerting.There was a crack of light ahead of them. ""There we go,"" said the marquis. ""Bank Station. Good place to start looking.""""You're out of your mind,"" said Richard. He did not mean it to be heard, but the most sotto of voces carried and echoed in the darkness.""Indeed?"" said the marquis. The ground began to rumble: an Underground train was somewhere close at hand.""Richard, just leave it,"" said Door.But it was coming out of his mouth: ""Well,"" he said. ""You're both being silly. There are no such things as angels.""The marquis nodded, said, ""Ah. Yes. I understand you now. There are no such things as angels. Just as there is no London Below, no rat-speakers, no shepherds in Shepherd's Bush.""""There are no shepherds in Shepherd's Bush. I've been there. It's just houses and stores and roads and the BBC. That's all,"" pointed out Richard, flatly.""There are shepherds,"" said Hunter, from the darkness just next to Richard's ear. ""Pray you never meet them."" She sounded perfectly serious.""Well,"" said Richard, ""I still don't believe that there are flocks of angels wandering about down here.""""There aren't,"" said the marquis. ""Just one."" They had reached the end of the tunnel. There was a locked door in front of them. The marquis stood back. ""My lady?"" he said, to Door. She rested a hand on it, for a moment. The door opened, silently.""Maybe,"" Richard said, persisting, ""we're thinking of different things. The angels I have in mind are all wings, haloes, trumpets, peace-on-earth-goodwill-unto-men.""""That's right,"" said Door. ""You got it. Angels."" They went through the door. Richard shut his eyes, involuntarily, at the sudden flood of light: it stabbed into his head like a migraine. As his eyes became used to the light, Richard found, to his surprise, that he knew where he was: they were in the long pedestrian tunnel that links Monument and Bank Tube stations. There were commuters wandering through the tunnels, none of whom gave the four of them even a first look. The perky wail of a saxophone echoed along the tunnel: Burt Bacharach and Hal David's ""I'll Never Fall In Love Again,"" being played more or less competently. They walked toward Bank Station.""Who are we looking for again, then?"" he asked, more or less innocently. ""The Angel Gabriel? Raphael? Michael?""They were passing a Tube map. The marquis tapped Angel Station with one long dark finger: Islington.Richard had passed through Angel Station hundreds of times. It was in trendy Islington, a district filled with antique shops and places to eat. He knew very little about angels, but he was almost certain that Islington's tube stop was named after a pub, or a landmark. He changed the subject. ""You know, when I tried to get on a Tube train a couple of days ago, it wouldn't let me.""""You just have to let them know who's boss, that's all,"" said Hunter, softly, from behind him.Door chewed her lower lip. ""This train we're looking for will let us on,"" she said. ""If we can find it."" Her words were almost drowned out by music coming from somewhere nearby. They went down a handful of steps and turned a corner.The saxophone player had his coat in front of him, on the floor of the tunnel. On the coat were a few coins, which looked as if the man had placed them there himself to persuade passersby that everyone was doing it. Nobody was fooled.The saxophone player was extremely tall; he had shoulder-length dark hair and a long, forked dark beard, which framed deep-set eyes and a serious nose. He wore a ragged T-shirt and oil-stained blue jeans. As the travelers reached him, he stopped playing, shook the spit from the saxophone mouthpiece, replaced it, and sounded the first notes the old Julie London song, ""Cry Me A River.""Now, you say you're sorry . . .Richard realized, with surprise, that the man could see them-and also that he was doing his best to pretend that he couldn't. The marquis stopped in front of him. The wail of the saxophone trailed off in a nervous squeak. The marquis flashed a cold grin. ""It's Lear, isn't it?"" he asked.The man nodded, warily. His fingers stroked the keys of his saxophone. ""We're looking for Earl's Court,"" continued the marquis. ""Would you happen to have such a thing as a train schedule about your person?""Richard was beginning to catch on. He assumed that the Earl's Court he referred to wasn't the familiar Tube station he had waited in innumerable times, reading a paper, or just daydreaming. The man named Lear moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue. "" 'S not impossible. What'd be in it for me, if I did?""The marquis thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his coat. Then he smiled, like a cat who had just been entrusted with the keys to a home for wayward but plump canaries. ""They say,"" he said, idly, as if he were simply passing the time, ""that Merlin's master Blaise once wrote a reel so beguiling that it would charm the coins from the pockets of anyone who heard it.""Lear's eyes narrowed. ""That'd be worth more than just a train schedule,"" he said. ""If you actually had it.""The marquis did a perfectly good impression of someone realizing, my, it would, wouldn't it? ""Well, then,"" he said, magnanimously, ""I suppose you would have to owe me, wouldn't you?""Lear nodded, reluctantly. He fumbled in his back pocket, pulled out a much-folded scrap of paper, and held it up. The marquis reached for it. Lear moved his hand away. ""Let me hear the reel first, you old trickster,"" he said. ""And it had better work.""The marquis raised an eyebrow. He darted a hand into, one of the inside pockets of his coat; when he pulled it out again it was holding a pennywhistle and a small crystal ball. He looked at the crystal ball, made the kind of ""hmmm"" noise that means, ""ah, so that's where that went,"" and he put it away again. Then he flexed his fingers, put the pennywhistle to his lips, and began to play an odd, rollicking tune that leapt and twisted and sang. It made Richard feel as if he were thirteen years old again, listening to the Top Twenty on his best friend's transistor radio at school during lunch hour, back when pop music had mattered as it only can in your early teenage years: the marquis's reel was everything he had ever wanted to hear in a song . . .A handful of coins chinked onto Lear's coat, thrown by passers-by, who walked on with a smile on their faces and a spring in their step. The marquis lowered his pennywhistle. ""I owe you, then, you old rascal,"" said Lear, nodding.""Yes. You do."" The marquis took the paper-the train schedule-from Lear, and scanned it, and nodded. ""But a word to the wise. Don't overuse it. A little goes a very long way.""And the four of them walked away, down the long corridor, surrounded by posters advertising films and underwear, and the occasional official-looking notices warning musicians playing for coins to move away from the station, listening to the sob of the saxophone, and to the sound of money landing on a coat.The marquis led them to a Central Line platform. Richard walked over to the edge of the platform and looked down. He wondered, as he always did, which one the live rail was; and decided, as he always did, that it was the one farthest from the platform, with the large whitish porcelain insulators, between it and the ground; and then he found himself smiling, involuntarily, at a tiny dark gray mouse who was bravely prowling the tracks, three feet below him, in a mousy, quest for abandoned sandwiches and dropped potato chips.A voice came over the loudspeaker, that formal, disembodied male voice that warned ""Mind the Gap."" It was intended to keep unwary passengers from stepping into the space between the train and the platform. Richard, like most Londoners, barely heard it anymore-it was like aural wallpaper. But suddenly, Hunter's hand was on his arm. ""Mind the Gap,"" she said urgently, to Richard. ""Stand back over there. By the wall.""""What?"" said Richard.""I said,"" said Hunter, ""mind the-""And then it erupted over the side of the platform. It was diaphanous, dreamlike, a ghost-thing, the color of black smoke, and it welled up like silk under water, and, moving astonishingly fast while still seeming to drift almost in slow motion, it wrapped itself tightly around Richard's ankle. It stung, even through the fabric of his Levi's. The thing pulled him toward the edge of the platform, and he staggered.He realized, as if from a distance, that Hunter had pulled out her staff and was smacking the tentacle of smoke with it, hard, repeatedly.There was a faraway screaming noise, thin and mindless, like an idiot child deprived of its toy. The smoke-tentacle let go of Richard's ankle and slid back over the edge of the platform, and it was gone. Hunter took Richard by the scruff of the neck and pulled him toward the back wall, where Richard slumped against it. He was trembling, and the world seemed suddenly utterly unreal. The color had been sucked from his jeans wherever the thing had touched him, making them look as if they'd been ineptly bleached. He pulled up the trouser leg: tiny purple welts were coming up on the skin of his ankle and calf. ""What . . . "" he tried to say, but nothing came out. He swallowed, and tried again. ""What was that?""Hunter looked down at him impassively. Her face could have been carved from brown wood. ""I don't think it has a name,"" she said. ""They live in the gaps. I did warn you.""""I've . . . never seen one before.""""You weren't part of the Underside before,"" said Hunter. ""Just wait by the wall. It's safer.""The marquis was checking the time on a large gold pocket-watch. He returned it to his waistcoat pocket, consulted the paper Lear had given him, and nodded, satisfied. ""We're in luck,"" he pronounced. ""The Earl's Court train should be coming through here in about half an hour.""""Earl's Court Station isn't on the Central Line,"" pointed out Richard.The marquis stared at Richard, openly amused. ""What a refreshing mind you have, young man,"" he said. ""There really is nothing quite like total ignorance, is there?""The warm wind began to blow. An Underground train pulled up at the station. People got off and other people got on, going about the business of their lives, and Richard watched them with envy. ""Mind the Gap,"" intoned the recorded voice. ""Stand clear of the doors. Mind the Gap."" Door took one look at Richard. Then, apparently worried about what she was seeing, she walked over to him, and she took his hand. He was very pale, and his breath was coming shallow and fast. ""Mind the Gap,"" boomed the recorded voice again. ""I'm fine,"" lied Richard bravely, to no one in particular.The central courtyard of Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar's hospital was a dank and cheerless place. Ragged grass grew up through the abandoned desks, rubber tires, and bits of office furniture. The overall impression given by the area was that a decade before (perhaps out of boredom, perhaps out of frustration, perhaps even as a statement, or as performance art) a number of people had thrown the contents of their offices out of their windows, high above, and had left them there on the ground to rot.There was broken glass there, as well, broken glass in abundance. There were also several mattresses, some of which looked like they had at some point been set on fire. Grass grew up through the springs. An entire ecology had evolved around the ornamental fountain in the center of the well, which had for a long time been neither particularly ornamental nor a fountain. A cracked and leaking water pipe nearby had, with the aid of some rainwater, transformed it into a breeding ground for a number of little frogs who plopped about cheerfully, rejoicing in their freedom from any non-airborne natural predators. Crows and blackbirds and even occasional seagulls, however, regarded the place as a cat-free delicatessen, specializing in frogs.Slugs sprawled indolently under the springs of the burnt mattresses; snails left slime trails across the broken glass; large black beetles scuttled industriously over smashed gray plastic telephones and mysteriously mutilated Barbie dolls.Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar had come up for a change of air. They were walking slowly around the perimeter of the central yard, broken glass crunching beneath their feet; they looked like shadows in their frayed black suits. Mr. Croup was in a cold fury. He was walking twice as fast as Mr. Vandemar, circling him, and almost dancing in his anger. At times, as if unable to contain the rage inside, Mr. Croup would fling himself at the hospital wall, physically attack it with his fists and feet, as if it were a poor substitute for a real person. Mr. Vandemar, on the other hand, simply walked. It was too consistent, too steady and inexorable a walk to be described as a stroll: Death walked like Mr. Vandemar. Mr. Vandemar watched Mr. Croup, impassively, as Mr. Croup kicked a sheet of glass that had been leaning against a wall. It shattered with a satisfying crash.""I, Mister Vandemar,"" said Mr. Croup, surveying the wreckage, ""I, for one, have had almost as much as I'm willing to take. Almost. Pussyfooting, trifling, lollygagging, shilly-shallying . . . whey-faced toad-I could pop out his eyes with my thumbs . . . ""Mr. Vandemar shook his head. ""Not yet,"" he said. ""He's our boss. For this job. After we've been paid, maybe we could have some fun on our own time."" Mr. Croup spat on the ground. ""He's a worthless, conniving dunderhead . . . We should butcher the bitch. Annul, cancel, inhume, and amortize her.""A telephone began to ring, loudly. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar looked around, puzzled. Eventually Mr. Vandemar found the telephone, halfway down a pile of rubble on top of a scree of water-stained medical records. Broken wires trailed from the back of it. He picked it up and passed it to Mr. Croup. ""For you,"" he said. Mr. Vandemar did not like telephones.""Mister Croup here,"" said Croup. Then, obsequiously, ""Oh. It's you, sir . . . "" A pause. ""At present, as you requested, she is walking around, free as a daisy. I'm afraid your bodyguard idea went down like a dead baboon . . . Varney? Yes, he's quite dead."" Another pause.""Sir, I am commencing to have certain conceptual problems with the role of myself and my partner in these shenanigans."" There was a third pause, and Mr. Croup went paler than pale. ""Unprofessional?"" he asked, mildly. ""Us?"" He curled his hand into a fist, which he slammed, hard, into the side of a brick wall. There was no change, however, in his tone of voice as he said, ""Sir. Might I with due respect remind you that Mister Vandemar and myself burned down the City of Troy? We brought the Black Plague to Flanders. We have assassinated a dozen kings, five popes, half a hundred heroes and two accredited gods. Our last commission before this was the torturing to death of an entire monastery in sixteenth-century Tuscany. We are utterly professional.""Mr. Vandemar, who had been amusing himself by catching little frogs and seeing how many he could stuff into his mouth at a time, said, with his mouth full, ""I liked doing that . . . """"My point?"" asked Mr. Croup, and he flicked some imaginary dust from his threadbare black suit, ignoring the real dust as he did so. ""My point is that we are assassins. We are cutthroats. We kill."" He listened to something, then said, ""Well, what about the Upworlder? Why can't we kill him?"" Mr. Croup twitched, spat once more, and kicked the wall, as he stood there holding the rust-stained, half-broken telephone.""Scare her? We're cutthroats, not scarecrows."" A pause. He took a deep breath. ""Yes, I understand, but I don't like it."" The person at the other end of the phone had hung up. Mr. Croup looked down at the telephone. Then he hefted it in one hand and proceeded methodically to smash it into shards of plastic and metal by banging it against the wall.Mr. Vandemar walked over. He had found a large black slug with a bright orange underbelly, and he was chewing it, like a fat cigar. The slug was trying to crawl away down Mr. Vandemar's chin. ""Who was that?"" asked Mr. Vandemar.""Who the hell do you think it was?""Mr. Vandemar chewed, thoughtfully, then sucked the slug into his mouth. ""A scarecrow man?"" he ventured.""Our employer.""""That was going to be my next guess.""""Scarecrows,"" spat Mr. Croup, disgusted. He was moving from a red rage to an oily gray sulk.Mr. Vandemar swallowed the contents of his mouth and wiped his lips on his sleeve. ""Best way to scare crows,"" said Mr. Vandemar, ""you just creep up behind them and put your hand round their little crow necks and squeeze until they don't move anymore. That scares the stuffing out of them.""And then he was silent; and from far above they heard the sound of crows flying, cawing angrily.""Crows. Family Corvidae. Collective noun,"" intoned Mr. Croup, relishing the sound of the word, ""a murder.""Richard waited against the wall, next to Door. She said very little; she chewed her fingernails, ran her hands through her reddish hair until it was sticking up in all directions, then tried to push it back down again. She was certainly unlike anyone he had ever known. When she noticed him looking at her, she shrugged and shimmied down further into her layers of clothes, deeper into her leather jacket. Her face looked out at the world from inside the jacket. The expression on her face made Richard think of a beautiful homeless child he had seen, the previous winter, behind Covent Garden: he had not been certain whether it was a girl or a boy. Its mother was begging, pleading with the passers-by for coins to feed the child and the infant that she carried in her arms. But the child stared out at the world and said nothing, although it must have been cold and hungry. It just stared.Hunter stood by Door, looking back and forth down the platform. The marquis had told them where to wait, and then he had slipped away. From somewhere, Richard heard a baby begin to cry. The marquis slipped out of an exit-only door and walked toward them. He was chewing on a piece of candy.""Having fun?"" asked Richard. A train was coming toward them, its approach heralded by a gust of warm wind.""Just taking care of business,"" said the marquis. He consulted the piece of paper and his watch. He pointed to a place on the platform. ""This should be the Earl's Court train. Stand behind me here, you three."" Then, as the Underground train-a rather boring-looking, normal train, Richard was disappointed to observe-rumbled and rattled its way into the station, the marquis leaned across Richard and said to Door, ""My lady? There is something that perhaps I should have mentioned earlier.""She turned her odd-colored eyes on him. ""Yes?""""Well,"" he said, ""the earl might not be entirely pleased to see me.""The train slowed down and stopped. The car that had pulled up in front of Richard was quite empty: its lights were turned off, it was bleak and empty and dark. From time to time Richard had noticed cars like this one, locked and shadowy, on Tube trains, and he had wondered what purpose they served. The other doors on the train hissed open, and passengers got on and got off. The doors of the darkened car remained closed. The marquis drummed on the door with his fist, an intricate rhythmic rap. Nothing happened. Richard was just wondering if the train would now pull out without them on it, when the door of the dark car was pushed open from the inside. It opened about six inches, and an elderly, bespectacled face peered out at them.""Who knocks?"" he said.Through the opening, Richard could see flames burning, and people, and smoke inside the car. Through the glass in the doors, however, he still saw a dark and empty carriage. ""The Lady Door,"" announced the marquis, smoothly, ""and her companions.""The door slid open all the way, and they were inside Earl's Court.
NW_ch7	NW	Neverwhere	7	4053	23363	NeverwhereSEVENThere was straw scattered on the floor, over a layer of rushes. There was an open log fire, sputtering and blazing in a large fireplace. There were a few chickens, strutting and pecking on the floor. There were seats with hand-embroidered cushions on them, and there were tapestries covering the windows and the doors.Richard stumbled forward as the train lurched out of the station. He reached out, grabbed hold of the nearest person, and regained his balance. The nearest person happened to be a short, gray, elderly man-at-arms, who would have looked, Richard decided, exactly like a recently retired minor official were it not for the tin hat, the surcoat, the rather clumsily knitted chain mail, and the spear; instead he looked like a recently retired minor official who had, somewhat against his will, been dragooned into his local amateur dramatic society, where he had been forced to play a man-at-arms.The little gray man blinked shortsightedly at Richard as Richard grabbed him, and then he said, lugubriously, ""Sorry about that.""""My fault,"" said Richard.""I know,"" said the man.An enormous Irish wolfhound padded down the aisle and stopped beside a lute player, who sat on the floor picking at a melody in a desultory fashion. The wolfhound glared at Richard, snorted with disdain, then lay down and went to sleep. At the far end of the carriage an elderly falconer, with a hooded falcon on his wrist, was exchanging pleasantries with a small knot of damsels of a certain age. Some passengers obviously stared at the four travelers; others, just as obviously, ignored them. It was, Richard realized, as if someone had taken a small medieval court and put it, as best they could, in one car of an Underground train.A herald raised his bugle to his lips and played a tuneless blast, as an immense, elderly man, in a huge fur-lined dressing gown and carpet slippers, staggered through the connecting door from the next compartment, his arm resting on the shoulder of a jester in shabby motley. The old man was larger than life in every way: he wore an eye-patch over his left eye, which had the effect of making him look slightly helpless, and unbalanced, like a one-eyed hawk. There were fragments of food in his red-gray beard, and what appeared to be pajama pants were visible at the bottom of his shabby fur gown. That, thought Richard, correctly, must be the earl. The earl's jester was an elderly man with a pinched, humorless mouth and a painted face. He led the earl to a thronelike carved wooden seat in which, a trifle unsteadily, the earl sat down. The wolfhound got up, padded down the length of the carriage, and settled itself at the earl's slippered feet. Earl's Court, thought Richard. Of course. And then he began to wonder whether there was a baron in Barons Court Tube station, or a Raven in Ravenscourt or, . . .The little old man-at-arms coughed asthmatically and said, ""Right then, you lot. State your business."" Door stepped forward. She held her head up high, suddenly seeming taller and more at ease than Richard had previously seen her, and she said, ""We seek an audience with His Grace the Earl.""The earl called down the carriage. ""What did the little girl say, Halvard?"" he asked. Richard wondered if he was deaf.Halvard, the elderly man-at-arms, shuffled around and cupped his hand to his mouth. ""They seek an audience, Your Grace,"" he shouted, over the rattle of the train.The earl pushed aside his thick fur cap and scratched his head, meditatively. He was balding underneath his cap. ""They do? An audience? How splendid. Who are they, Halvard?""Halvard turned back to them. ""He wants to know who you all are. Keep it short, though. Don't go on."" ""I am the Lady Door,"" announced Door. ""The Lord Portico was my father.""The earl brightened at this, leaned forward, peered through the smoke with his one good eye. ""Did she say she was Portico's oldest girl?"" he asked the jester.""Yus, your grace.""The earl beckoned to Door. ""Come here,"" he said. ""Come-come-come. Let me look at you."" She walked down the swaying carriage, grabbing the thick rope straps that hung from the ceiling as she went, to keep her balance. When she stood before the earl's wooden chair, she curtseyed. He scratched at his beard and stared at her. ""We were all quite devastated to hear of your father's unfortunate-"" said the earl, and then he interrupted himself, and said, ""Well, all your family, it was a-"" and he trailed off, and said, ""You know I had warmest regards for him, did a bit of business together . . . good old Portico . . . full of ideas . . . "" He stopped. Then he tapped the jester on the shoulder and whispered, in a querulous boom, loud enough that it could be heard easily over the noise of the train, ""Go and make jokes at them, Tooley. Earn your keep.""The earl's fool staggered up the aisle with an arthritic step. He stopped in front of Richard. ""And who might you be?"" he asked.""Me?"" said Richard. ""Um. Me? My name? It's Richard. Richard Mayhew.""""Me?"" squeaked the fool, in an elderly, rather theatrical imitation of Richard's Scottish accent. ""Me? Um. Me? La, nuncle. Tis not a man, but a mooncalf."" The courtiers sniggered, dustily.""And I,"" de Carabas told the jester, with a blinding smile, ""call myself the marquis de Carabas."" The fool blinked.""De Carabas the thief?"" asked the jester. ""De Carabas the bodysnatcher? De Carabas the traitor?"" He turned to the courtiers around them. ""But this cannot be de Carabas. For why? Because de Carabas has long since been banished from the earl's presence. Perhaps it is instead a strange new species of stoat, who grew particularly large."" The courtiers tittered uneasily, and a low buzz of troubled conversation began. The earl said nothing, but his lips were pressed together tightly, and he had begun to tremble.""I am called Hunter,"" said Hunter to the jester. The courtiers were silent then. The jester opened his mouth, as if he were going to say something, and then he looked at her, and he closed his mouth again. A hint of a smile played at the corner of Hunter's perfect lips. ""Go on,"" she said. ""Say something funny.""The jester stared at the trailing toes of his shoes. Then he muttered, ""My hound hath no nose.""The earl, who had been staring at the marquis de Carabas with eyes like a slow-burning fuse, now exploded to his feet, a gray-bearded volcano, an elderly berserker. His head brushed the roof of the carriage. He pointed at the marquis and shouted, spittle flying, ""I will not stand for it, I will not. Make him come forward.""Halvard waggled a gloomy spear at the marquis, who sauntered to the front of the train, until he stood beside Door in front of the earl's throne. The wolfhound growled in the back of its throat.""You,"" said the earl, stabbing the air with a huge, knotted finger. ""I know you, de Carabas. I haven't forgotten. I may be old, but I haven't forgotten.""The marquis bowed. ""Might I remind Your Grace,"" he said urbanely, ""that we had a deal? I negotiated the peace treaty between your people and the Raven's Court. And in return you agreed to provide a little favor."" So there is a raven's court, thought Richard. He wondered what it was like.""A little favor?"" said the earl. He turned a deep beet red color. ""Is that what you call it? I lost a dozen men to your foolishness in the retreat from White City. I lost an eye.""""And if you don't mind my saying so, Your Grace,"" said the marquis, graciously, ""that is a very fetching patch. It sets off your face perfectly.""""I swore . . . "" fulminated the earl, beard bristling, ""I swore . . . that if you ever set foot in my domain I would . . . "" he trailed off. Shook his head, confused and forgetful. Then he continued. ""It'll come back to me. I do not forget.""""He might not be entirely pleased to see you?"" whispered Door to de Carabas.""Well, he's not,"" he muttered back.Door stepped forward once more. ""Your Grace,"" she said, loudly, clearly, ""de Carabas is here with me as my guest and my companion. For the fellowship there has ever been between your family and mine, for the friendship between my father and-""""He abused my hospitality,"" boomed the earl. ""I swore that . . . if he ever again entered my domain I would have him gutted and dried . . . like, like something that had been gutted, first . . . like . . . """"Perchance-then dried a kipper, my lord?"" suggested the jester.The earl shrugged. ""It is of no matter. Guards, seize him."" And they did. While neither of the guards would ever see sixty again, each of them was holding a crossbow, pointed at the marquis, and their hands did not tremble, neither with age nor with fear. Richard looked at Hunter. She seemed untroubled by this: she was watching it almost with amusement, like someone attending the theater.Door folded her arms and stood taller, putting her head back, raising her pointed chin. She looked less like a ragged street pixie; more like someone used to getting her own way. The opal eyes flashed. ""Your Grace, the marquis is with me as my companion, on my quest. Our families have been friends for a long time now-""""Yes. They have,"" interrupted the earl, helpfully. ""Hundreds of years. Hundreds and hundreds. Knew your grandfather, too. Funny old fellow. Bit vague,"" he confided.""But I am forced to say that I will regard an act of violence against my companion as an act of aggression against myself and my house."" The girl stared up at the old man. He towered over her. They stood for some moments, frozen. He tugged on his red-and-gray beard, agitatedly, then he thrust out his lower lip like a small child. ""I will not have him here,"" he said.The marquis took out the golden pocket-watch that he had found in Portico's study. He examined it, carelessly. Then he turned to Door and said, as if none of the events around them had occurred. ""My lady, I will obviously be of more use to you off this train than on. And I have other avenues to explore.""""No,"" she said. ""If you go, we all go.""""I don't think so,"" said the marquis. ""Hunter will look after you as long as you stay in London Below. I'll meet you at the next market. Don't do anything too stupid in the meantime."" The train was coming into a station,Door fixed the earl with her look: there was something more ancient and powerful in that glance than her young years would have seemed to allow. Richard noticed that the room fell quiet whenever she spoke. ""Will you let him go in peace, Your Grace?"" she asked.The earl ran his hands over his face, rubbed his good eye and his eye-patch, then looked back at her. ""Just make him go,"" said the earl. He looked at the marquis. ""Next time . . . "" he ran a thick old finger across his Adam's apple "" . . . kipper.""The marquis bowed low. ""I'll see myself out,"" he said to the guards, and stepped toward the open door. Halvard raised his crossbow and pointed it toward the marquis's back. Hunter reached out her hand and pushed the end of the crossbow back down toward the floor. The marquis stepped onto the platform, turned and waved with an elaborate flourish. The door hissed closed behind him.The earl sat down on his huge chair at the end of the car. He said nothing. The train rattled and lurched through the dark tunnel. ""Where are my manners?"" muttered the earl to himself. He looked at them with one staring eye. Then he said it again, in a desperate boom that Richard could feel in his stomach, like a bass drumbeat. ""Where are my manners?"" He motioned one of the elderly men-at-arms to him. ""They will be hungry after their journey, Dagvard. Thirsty, too, I shouldn't wonder.""""Yes, Your Grace.""""Stop the train!"" called the earl. The doors hissed open, and Dagvard scuttled off onto a platform. Richard watched the people on the platform. No one came into their car. No one seemed to notice that anything was at all unusual.Dagvard walked over to a vending machine on the side of the platform. He took off his metal helmet. Then he rapped, with one mailed glove, on the side of the machine. ""Orders from the earl,"" he said. ""Choc'lits."" A ratcheting whirr came from deep in the guts of the machine, and it began to spit out dozens of Cadbury's Fruit and Nut chocolate bars, one after another. Dagvard held his helmet below the opening to catch them. The doors began to close. Halvard put the handle of his pike between the doors, and they opened again and began bumping open and shut on the pike handle. ""Please stand clear of the doors,"" said a loudspeaker voice. ""The train cannot leave until the doors are all closed.""The earl was staring at Door lopsidedly, with his one good eye. ""So. What brings you here to me?"" he asked.She licked her lips. ""Well, indirectly, Your Grace, my father's death.""He nodded, slowly. ""Yes. You seek vengeance. Quite right, too."" He coughed, then recited, in a basso profundo, ""Brave the battling blade, flashes the furious fire, steel sword sheathed in hated heart, crimsons the . . . the . . . something. Yes.""""Vengeance?"" Door thought for a moment. ""Yes. That was what my father said. But I mostly just want to understand what happened, and to protect myself. My family had no enemies."" Dagvard staggered back onto the train then, his helmet filled with chocolate bars and cans of Coke; the doors were permitted to close, and the train moved off once more.Lear's coat, still on the floor of the tunnel, was covered in coins and bills, now, but it was also covered with shoes-kicking the coins, smearing and tearing the bills, ripping the fabric of the coat. Lear had begun to cry. ""Please. Why won't you leave me alone?"" he begged. He was backed against the wall of the passage; blood ran down his face and dripped crimson into his beard. His saxophone hung limply, awkwardly, on his chest, dented and scraped.He was surrounded by a small crowd of people-more than twenty, less than fifty-every one of them shoving and pushing, in a mindless mob, their eyes blank and staring, each man and woman desperately fighting and clawing in order to give Lear their money. There was blood on the tiled wall, where Lear had knocked his head. Lear flailed out at one middle-aged woman, her purse wide open, a fistful of five-pound notes thrust out at him. She clawed at his face in her eagerness to give him her money. He twisted to avoid her fingernails and fell to the tunnel floor.Someone stepped on his hand. His face was pushed into a slurry of coins. He began to sob, and to curse. ""I told you not to overuse that tune,"" said an elegant voice, nearby. ""Naughty.""""Help me,"" gasped Lear.""Well, there is a counter-charm,"" admitted the voice, almost reluctantly.The crowd was pressing closer now. A flung fifty-pence coin opened Lear's cheek. He curled into a fetal ball, hugging himself, burying his face in his knees. ""Play it, damn you,"" sobbed Lear. ""Whatever you want . . . just make them stop . . . ""A pennywhistle piping began softly, and echoed down the passage. A simple phrase, repeated over and over, slightly different every time: the de Carabas variations. The footsteps were moving away. Shuffling, at first, then picking up pace: moving away from him. Lear opened his eyes. The marquis de Carabas was leaning against the wall, playing the pennywhistle. When he saw Lear looking at him he took the whistle from his lips and replaced it in an inside pocket of his coat. He tossed Lear a lace-edged handkerchief of patched linen. Lear wiped the blood from his forehead and face. ""They would have killed me,"" he said, accusingly.""I did warn you,"" said de Carabas. ""Just count yourself lucky that I was coming back this way."" He helped Lear into a sitting position. ""Now,"" he said. ""I think you owe me another favor.""Lear picked up his coat-torn and muddy and imprinted with the marks of many feet-from the passage floor. He suddenly felt very cold, and he wrapped the shredded coat around his shoulders. Coins fell, and bills fluttered to the floor. He let them lie. ""Was I really lucky? Or did you set me up?""The marquis looked almost offended. ""I don't know how you could even bring yourself to think such a thing.""'""Cos I know you. That's how. So what is it that you want me to do this time? Theft? Arson?"" Lear sounded resigned, and a little sad. And then, ""Murder?""De Carabas reached down and took back his handkerchief. ""Theft, I'm afraid. You were right the first time,"" he said, with a smile. ""I find myself in rather urgent need of a piece of T'ang dynasty sculpture."" Lear shivered. Then, slowly, he nodded.Richard was handed a bar of Cadbury's Fruit and Nut chocolate and a large silver goblet, ornamented around the rim with what appeared to Richard to be sapphires. The goblet was filled with Coca-Cola. The jester, whose name seemed to be Tooley, cleared his throat loudly. ""I would like to propose a toast to our guests,"" he said. ""A child, a bravo, a fool. May they each get what they deserve.""""Which one am I?"" whispered Richard to Hunter.""The fool, of course,"" she said.""In the old days,"" said Halvard dismally, after sipping his Coke, ""we had wine. I prefer wine. It's not as sticky.""""Do all the machines just give you things like that?"" asked Richard.""Oh yes,"" said the old man. ""They listen to the earl, y'see. He rules the Underground. The bit with the trains. He's lord of the Central, the Circle, the Jubilee, the Victorious, the Bakerloo-well, all of them except the Underside Line.""""What's the Underside Line?"" asked Richard. Halvard shook his head and pursed his lips. Hunter brushed Richard's shoulder with her fingers. ""Remember what I told you about the shepherds of Shepherd's Bush?""""You said I didn't want to meet them, and there were some things I was probably better off not knowing.""""Good,"" she said, ""So now you can add the Underside Line to the list of those things.""Door came back down the carriage toward them. She was smiling. ""The earl's agreed to help us,"" she said. ""Come on. He's meeting us in the library."" Richard began to follow, as he realized that the question What library? had not risen to his lips. The longer he was here, the more he took at face value. Instead, he followed Door toward the earl's empty throne, and round the back of it, and through the connecting door behind it, and into the library. It was a huge stone room, with a high wooden ceiling. Each wall was covered with shelves. Each shelf was laden with objects: there were books, yes. But the shelves were filled with a host of other things: tennis rackets, hockey sticks, umbrellas, a spade, a notebook computer, a wooden leg, several mugs, dozens of shoes, pairs of binoculars, a small log, six glove puppets, a lava lamp, various CDs, records (LPs, 45s, and 78s), cassette tapes and eight-tracks, dice, toy cars, assorted pairs of dentures, watches, flashlights, four garden gnomes of assorted sizes (two fishing, one of them mooning, the last smoking a cigar), piles of newspapers, magazines, grimoires, three-legged stools, a box of cigars, a plastic nodding-head Alsatian, socks . . . the room was a tiny empire of lost property.""This is his real domain,"" muttered Hunter. ""Things lost. Things forgotten.""There were windows set in the stone wall. Through them, Richard could see the rattling darkness and the passing lights of the Underground tunnels. The earl was sitting on the floor with his legs splayed, patting the wolfhound and scratching it underneath the chin. The jester stood beside him, looking embarrassed. The earl clambered to his feet when he saw them. His forehead creased. ""Ah. There you are. Now, there was a reason I asked you here, it'll come to me . . . "" He tugged at his red-gray beard, a tiny gesture from such a huge man.""The Angel Islington, Your Grace,"" said Door politely.""Oh yes. Your father had a lot of ideas for changes, you know. Asked me about them. I don't trust change. I sent him to Islington."" He stopped. Blinked his one eye. ""Did I tell you this already?""""Yes, Your Grace. And how can we get to Islington?""The earl nodded as if Door had said something profound. ""Only once by the quick way. After that you have to go the long way down. Dangerous.""Door said, patiently, ""And the quick way is . . . ?""""No, no. Need to be an opener to use it. Only good for Portico's family."" He rested a huge hand on her shoulder. Then his hand slid up to her cheek. ""Better off staying here with me. Keep an old man warm at night, eh?"" He leered at her and touched her tangle of hair with his old fingers. Hunter took a step toward Door. Door gestured with her hand: No. Not yet.Door looked up at the earl, and said, ""Your Grace, I am Portico's oldest daughter. How do I get to the Angel Islington?"" Richard found himself amazed that Door was able to keep her temper in the face of the earl's losing battle with temporal drift.The earl winked his single eye in a solemn blink: an old hawk, his head tipped on one side. Then he took his hand from her hair. ""So you are. So you are. Portico's daughter. How is your dear father? Keeping well, I hope? Fine man. Good man.""""How do we get to the Angel Islington?"" said Door, but now there was a tremble in her voice.""Hmm? Use the Angelus, of course.""Richard found himself imagining the earl sixty, eighty, five hundred years ago: a mighty warrior, a cunning strategist, a great lover of women, a fine friend, a terrifying foe. There was still the wreckage of that man in there somewhere. That was what made him so terrible, and so sad. The earl fumbled on the shelves, moving pens and pipes and peashooters, little gargoyles and dead leaves. Then, like an aged cat stumbling on a mouse, he seized a small, rolled-up scroll, and handed it to the girl. ""Here y'go, lassie,"" said the earl. ""All in here. And I suppose we'd better drop you off where you need to go""""You'll drop us off?"" asked Richard. ""In a train?""The earl looked around for the source of the sound, focused on Richard, and smiled enormously. ""Oh, think nothing of it,"" he boomed. ""Anything for Portico's daughter."" Door clutched the scroll tightly, triumphantly.Richard could feel the train beginning to slow, and he, and Door, and Hunter were led out of the stone room and back into the car. Richard peered out at the platform, as they slowed down.""Excuse me. What station is this?"" he asked. The train had stopped, facing one of the station signs: BRITISH MUSEUM, it said. Somehow, this was one oddity too many. He could accept ""Mind the Gap"" and the Earl's Court, and even the strange library. But damn it, like all Londoners, he knew his Tube map, and this was going too far. ""There isn't a British Museum Station,"" said Richard, firmly.""There isn't?"" boomed the earl. ""Then, mm, then you must be very careful as you get off the train."" And he guffawed, delightedly, and tapped his jester on the shoulder. ""Hear that, Tooley? I am as funny as you are.""The jester smiled as bleak a smile as ever was seen. ""My sides are splitting, my ribs are cracking, and my mirth is positively uncontainable, Your Grace,"" he said.The doors hissed open. Door smiled up at the earl. ""Thank you,"" she said. ""Off, off,"" said the vast old man, shooing Door and Richard and Hunter out of the warm, smoky carriage onto the empty platform. And then the doors closed, and the train moved away, and Richard found himself staring at a sign which, no matter how many times he blinked-nor even if he looked away from it and looked back suddenly to take it by surprise-still obstinately persisted in saying:BRITISH MUSEUM
NW_ch8	NW	Neverwhere	8	4506	25819	NeverwhereEIGHTIt was early evening, and the cloudless sky was transmuting from royal blue to a deep violet, with a smudge of fire orange and lime green over Paddington, four miles to the west, where, from Old Bailey's perspective anyway, the sun had recently set.Skies, thought Old Bailey, in a satisfied sort of a way. Never a two of them alike. Not by day nor not by night, neither. He was a bit of a connoisseur of skies, was Old Bailey, and this was a good 'un. The old man had pitched his tent for the night on a roof opposite St. Paul's Cathedral, in the center of the City of London.He was fond of St. Paul's, and it, at least, had changed little in the last three hundred years. It had been built in white Portland stone, which had, before it was even completed, begun to turn black from the soot and the filth in the smoky London air and now, following the cleaning of London in the 1970s, was more or less white again; but it was still St. Paul's. He was not sure that the same could be said for the rest of the City of London: he peered over the roof, stared away from his beloved Sky, down to the sodium-lit pavement below. He could see security cameras affixed to a wall, and a few cars, and one late office worker, locking a door and then walking toward the Tube. Brrr. Even the thought of going underground made Old Bailey shudder. He was a roof-man and proud of it; had fled the world at ground level so long ago . . .Old Bailey remembered when people had actually lived here in the City, not just worked; when they had lived and lusted and laughed, built ramshackle houses one leaning against the next, each house filled with noisy people. Why, the noise and the mess and the stinks and the songs from the alley across the way (then known, at least colloquially, as Shitten Alley) had been legendary in their time, but no one lived in the City now. It was a cold and cheerless place of offices, of people who worked in the day and went home to somewhere else at night. It was not a place for living anymore. He even missed the stinks.The last smudge of orange sun faded into nocturnal purple. The old man covered the cages, so the birds could get their beauty sleep. They grumbled, then slept. Old Bailey scratched his nose, after which he went into his tent and fetched a blackened stew-pot, some water, some carrots and potatoes, salt, and a well-hanged pair of dead, plucked starlings. He walked out onto the roof, lit a small fire in a soot-blackened coffee can, and was putting his stew on to cook when he became aware that someone was watching him from the shadows by a chimney stack.He picked up his toasting fork and waved it threateningly at the chimney stack. ""Who's there?""The marquis de Carabas stepped out of the shadows, bowed perfunctorily, and smiled gloriously. Old Bailey lowered his toasting fork. ""Oh,"" he said. ""It's you. Well, what do you want? Knowledge? Or birds?""The marquis walked over, picked a slice of raw carrot from Old Bailey's stew, and munched it. ""Information, actually,"" he said.Old Bailey chortled. ""Hah,"" he said. ""There's a first. Ehh?"" Then he leaned toward the marquis. ""What'll you trade for it?""""What do you need?""""Maybe I should do what you do. I should ask for another favor. An investment for one day down the road."" Old Bailey grinned.""Much too expensive, in the long run,"" said the marquis, without humor.Old Bailey nodded. Now the sun had gone down, it was getting very cold, very fast. ""Shoes, then,"" he said. ""And a balaclava hat."" He inspected his fingerless gloves: they were more hole than glove. ""And new gloveses. It's going to be a bastard winter.""""Very well. I'll bring them to you."" The marquis de Carabas put his hand into an inside pocket and produced, like a magician producing a rose from thin air, the black animal figure he had taken from Portico's study. ""Now. What can you tell me about this?""Old Bailey pulled on his glasses. He took the object from de Carabas. It was cold to the touch. He sat down on an air-conditioning unit, then, turning the black obsidian statue over and over in his hand, he announced: ""It's the Great Beast of London."" The marquis said nothing. His eyes flickered from the statue to Old Bailey, impatiently. Old Bailey, enjoying the marquis's minor discomfort, continued at his own pace. ""Now, they say that back in first King Charlie's day-him 'as got his head all chopped off, silly bugger-before the fire and the plague, this was, there was a butcher lived down by the Fleet Ditch, had some poor creature he was going to fatten up for Christmas. Some says it was a piglet, and some says it wusn't, and there's some-and I list meself as one of them-that wusn't never properly certain. One night in December the beast runned away, ran into the Fleet Ditch, and vanished into the sewers. And it fed on the sewage, and it grew, and it grew. And it got meaner, and nastier. They'd send in hunting parties after it, from time to time.""The marquis pursed his lips. ""It must have died three hundred years ago.""Old Bailey shook his head. ""Things like that, they're too vicious to die. Too old and big and nasty.""The marquis sighed. ""I thought it was just a legend,"" he said. ""Like the alligators in the sewers of New York City.""Old Bailey nodded, sagely. ""What, the big white buggers? They're down there. I had a friend lost a head to one of them."" A moment of silence. Old Bailey handed the statue back to the marquis. Then he raised his hand and snapped it, like a crocodile head, at de Carabas. ""It was okay,"" gurned Old Bailey with a grin that was most terrible to behold. ""He had another.""The marquis sniffed, uncertain whether or not Old Bailey was pulling his leg. He made the statue of the Beast vanish inside his coat once more.""Hang on,"" said Old Bailey. He went back inside his brown tent and returned holding the ornate silver box the marquis had given him on their previous meeting. He held it out to the marquis. ""How about this then?"" he asked. ""Are you ready to take it back? It fair gives me the creepy shivers, having it around.""The marquis walked to the edge of the roof, dropped the eight feet to the next building. ""I'll take it back, when all this is over,"" he called. ""Let us hope that you don't have to use it.""Old Bailey leaned over. ""How will I know if I do?""""You'll know,"" called the marquis. ""And the rats will tell you what to do with it."" And with that he was over the side of the building, slipping down, using drainpipes and ledges as handholds.""Hope I never finds out, that's all I can say,"" said Old Bailey to himself. Then a thought struck him. ""Hoy,"" he called out to the night and the City. ""Don't forget the shoeses and the gloveses!""The advertisements on the walls were for refreshing and health-giving malted drinks, for two-shilling day excursions by train to the seaside, for kippered herrings, moustache wax and bootblack. They were smoke-blackened relics of the late twenties or the early thirties. Richard stared at them in disbelief. It seemed completely abandoned: a forgotten place. ""It is British Museum Station,"" admitted Richard. ""But . . . but there never was a British Museum Station. This is all wrong.""""It was closed down in about 1933, and sealed off,"" said Door.""How bizarre,"" said Richard. It was like walking through history. He could hear trains echoing through tunnels nearby, felt the push of air as they passed. ""Are there many stations like this?""""About fifty,"" said Hunter. ""They aren't all accessible, though. Not even to us.""There was a movement in the shadows at the edge of the platform. ""Hello,"" said Door. ""How are you?"" She went down into a crouch. A brown rat stepped out into the light. It sniffed at Door's hand.""Thank you!"" said Door, cheerfully. ""I'm glad you aren't dead, too.""Richard edged over. ""Um, Door. Could you tell the rat something for me?""The rat turned its head toward him. ""Miss Whiskers says that if there's anything you've got to say to her, you can tell it to her yourself,"" said Door.""Miss Whiskers?""Door shrugged. ""It's a literal translation,"" she said. ""It sounds better in rat.""Richard did not doubt it. ""Um. Hello . . . Miss Whiskers . . . Look, there was one of your rat-speaker people, a girl named Anaesthesia. She was taking me to the market. We were crossing this bridge in the dark, and she just never made it across.""The rat interrupted him, with a sharp squee. Door began to talk, hesitantly, like a simultaneous translator. ""She says . . . that the rats do not blame you for the loss. Your guide was . . . mm . . . taken by the night . . . as tribute.""""But-""The rat squeaked again. ""Sometimes they come back . . . "" said Door. ""She has taken note of your concern . . . and thanks you for it."" The rat nodded to Richard, blinked her bead-black eyes, then leapt to the floor and scurried back into the dark. ""Nice rat,"" said Door. Her disposition seemed to have improved remarkably, now that she had the scroll. ""Up there,"" she said, indicating an archway effectively blocked by an iron door.They walked over to it. Richard pushed against the metal, but it was locked from the other side. ""Looks like it's been sealed up,"" said Richard. ""We'll need special tools.""Door smiled, suddenly; her face seemed to be illuminated. For a moment, her elfin face became beautiful. ""Richard,"" she said. ""My family. We're openers. It's, our Talent. Look . . . "" She reached out a grubby hand, touched the door. For a long moment nothing happened, then there was a loud crash from the other side of the door, and a chunk from their side. Door pushed against the door and, with a fierce squeal from the rusted hinges, it opened. Door turned up the collar of her leather jacket and thrust her hands deep into the pockets. Hunter shone her flashlight into the blackness beyond the doorway: a flight of stone steps, going up, into the dark. ""Hunter. Can you take the rear?"" asked Door. ""I'll go on in front. Richard can take the middle.""She walked up a couple of steps. Hunter stayed where she was. ""Lady?"" said Hunter. ""You are going to London Above?""""That's right,"" said Door. ""We're going to the British Museum.""Hunter bit her lower lip. Then she shook her head. ""I must stay in London Below,"" she said. There was a tremble in her voice. Richard realized that this was the first time he had ever seen Hunter display any emotion other than effortless competence or, occasionally, tolerant amusement.""Hunter,"" said Door, bewildered. ""You're my bodyguard.""Hunter looked ill at ease. ""I am your bodyguard in London Below,"" she said. ""I cannot go with you to London Above.""""But you have to.""""My lady. I cannot. I thought you understood. The marquis knows."" Hunter will look after you as long as you stay in London Below, thought Richard. Yes.""No,"" said Door, her pointed chin pushed out and up, her odd-colored eyes narrowed. ""I don't understand. What is it?"" she added, scornfully. ""Some kind of curse or something?"" Hunter hesitated, licked her lips, then nodded. It was as if she were admitting to having some socially embarrassing disease.""Look, Hunter,"" Richard heard his own voice saying, ""don't be silly."" For a moment he thought she was about to hit him, which would have been bad, or even to start crying, which would have been much, much worse. Then she took a deep breath, and said, in measured tones, ""I will walk by your side when you are in London Below, my lady, and I shall guard your body from all harm that might befall you. But do not ask me to follow you to London Above. I cannot."" She folded her arms beneath her breasts, planted her legs a little apart, and looked for all the underworld like a statue of a woman not going anywhere, cast in brass and in bronze and in burnt caramel.""Right,"" said Door. ""Come on, Richard."" And she set off up the steps.""Look,"" said Richard. ""Why don't we stay down here? We can find the marquis, and then all set off together, and-"" Door was disappearing into the darkness above him. Hunter was planted at the foot of the stairs.""I shall wait here until she returns,"" Hunter told him. ""You may go, or stay, as you will.""Richard chased up the steps, as fast as he could, in the dark. Soon he saw Door's lamp-light above him. ""Wait,"" he panted. ""Please."" She stopped, and waited for him to catch up. And then, when he had caught up, and was standing next to her on a claustrophobically small landing, she waited for him to catch his breath. ""You can't just go running off like that,"" said Richard. Door said nothing; the line of her lips became slightly more compressed; the angle of her chin was ever-so-slightly raised. ""She's your bodyguard,"" he pointed out.Door began to walk up the next flight of steps. Richard followed her. ""Well, we'll be back soon enough,"" said Door. ""She can start guarding me again then.""The air was close, dank and oppressive. Richard wondered how you could tell if the air was bad, in the absence of a canary, and he contented himself with hoping that it wasn't. ""I think the marquis probably did know. About her curse, or whatever it is,"" he said.""Yes,"" she said. ""I expect he did.""""He . . . "" Richard began. ""The marquis. Well, you know, to be honest, he seems a little bit dodgy to me.""Door stopped. The steps dead-ended in a rough brick wall. ""Mm,"" she agreed. ""He's a little bit dodgy in the same way that rats are a little bit covered in fur.""""Then why go to him for help? Wasn't there someone else who could have helped you?""""We'll talk about it later."" She opened the scroll the earl had given her, glanced over the spidery handwriting, then rolled it back up. ""We'll be fine,"" she said, decisively. ""It's all in here. We've just got to get into the British Museum. We find the Angelus, we get out. Easy. Nothing to it. Close your eyes.""Richard closed his eyes, obediently. ""Nothing to it,"" he repeated. ""When people say that on films, it always means that something awful is going to happen.""He felt a breeze against his face. Something in the quality of the darkness beyond his closed eyelids changed. ""So what's your point?"" asked Door. The acoustics had altered as well: they were in a bigger room. ""You can open your eyes now.""He opened his eyes. They were on the other side of the wall, he assumed, in what appeared to be a junk room. Not just any old junk room, though: there was something rather strange and special about the quality of this junk. It was the kind of magnificent, rare, strange, and expensive junk one would only expect to see somewhere like . . . ""Are we in the British Museum?"" he asked. She frowned, and seemed to be thinking, or listening. ""Not exactly. We're very near. I think this must be some kind of storage space or something."" She reached up to touch the fabric of a suit of antique clothing, displayed on a wax dummy.""I wish we'd stayed back with the bodyguard"" said Richard.Door tipped her head on one side and looked at him gravely. ""And what do you need guarding from, Richard Mayhew?""""Nothing,"" he admitted. And then they turned the corner, and he said, ""Well . . . maybe them,"" and, at the same time, Door said, ""Shit."" Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were standing on plinths on each side of the aisle down which they walked.They reminded Richard horridly of an exhibition of contemporary art Jessica had once taken him to: an exciting young artist had announced that he would break down all the Taboos of Art, and to this end, had embarked on a campaign of systematic grave robbery, displaying the thirty most interesting results of his depredations in glass cases. The exhibit was closed after the artist sold Stolen Cadaver Number 25 to an advertising agency for a six-figure sum, and the relatives of Stolen Cadaver Number 25, seeing a photo of the sculpture in the Sun, had sued both for a share of the proceeds and to change the name of the art piece to Edgar Fospring, 1919-1987 Loving Husband, Father and Uncle. Rest in Peace, Daddy. Richard had stared at the glass-bound corpses in their stained suits and damaged dresses with horror: he hated himself for looking, but he had not been able to turn away.Mr. Croup smiled like a snake with a crescent moon stuck in its mouth, and his resemblance to Stolen Cadavers Numbers 1 to 30 was, if anything, increased by this. ""What?"" said the smiling Mr. Croup. ""No Mister 'I'm So Clever and Know Everything' Marquis? No 'Oh, didn't I tell you? Whoops! I can't go upstairs?' Hunter?"" He paused, for dramatic effect. ""So paint me gray and call me a dire wolf if it isn't two little lost lambs, out on their own, after dark.""""You could call me a wolf, too, Mister Croup,"" said Mr. Vandemar, helpfully.Mr. Croup clambered down from his plinth. ""A gentle word in your woolly ears, little lambkins,"" he said. Richard looked around them. There had to be somewhere they could run. He reached down, clasped Door's hand, and looked around, desperately.""No, please. Stay just where you are,"" said Mr. Croup. ""We like you like that. And we don't want to have to hurt you.""""We do,"" said Mr. Vandemar.""Well, yes, Mister Vandemar, once you put it like that. We want to hurt you both. We want to hurt you a lot. But that's not why we're here right now. We're here to make things more interesting. You see, when things get dull, my partner and I become restive and, hard as you may find this to believe, we lose our sunny and delightful dispositions.""Mr. Vandemar showed them his teeth, demonstrating his sunny and delightful disposition. It was unquestionably the most horrible thing that Richard had ever seen.""Leave us alone,"" said Door. Her voice was clear and steady. Richard squeezed her hand. If she could be brave, so could he. ""If you want to hurt her,"" he said, ""you'll have to kill me first.""Mr. Vandemar seemed genuinely pleased by this. ""All right,"" he said. ""Thanks.""""And we'll hurt you, too,"" said Mr. Croup.""Not yet, though,"" said Mr. Vandemar.""You see,"" explained Mr. Croup, in a voice like rancid butter, ""right now, we're just here to worry you.""Mr. Vandemar's voice was a night wind blowing over a desert of bones. ""Make you suffer,"" he said. ""Spoil your day.""Mr. Croup sat down at the base of Mr. Vandemar's plinth. ""You visited Earl's Court today,"" he said, in what Richard suspected he fondly imagined were light and conversational tones.""So?"" said Door. She was edging away from them, now.Mr. Croup smiled. ""How did we know that? How did we know where to find you now?""""Can get to you any time at all,"" said Mr. Vandemar, almost in a whisper.""You've been sold out, little ladybird,"" said Mr. Croup to Door-and, Richard realized, to Door alone. ""There's a traitor in your nest. A cuckoo.""""Come on,"" she said, and she ran. Richard ran with her, through the hall filled with junk, toward a door. At Door's touch, it opened.""Bid them farewell, Mister Vandemar,"" said Mr. Croup's voice, from behind them.""Bye bye,"" said Mr. Vandemar.""No-no,"" corrected Mr. Croup. ""Au revoir."" He made a noise then-the cuck-koo cuck-koo that a cuckoo might make, if it were five and a half feet high and had a weakness for human flesh-while Mr. Vandemar, truer to his nature, threw back his bullet head and howled like a wolf, ghostly and feral and mad.They were outside, in the open air, at night, running down a pavement in Bloomsbury's Russell Street. Richard thought his heart would pound its way through his chest. A large black car went by. The British Museum was on the other side of some high, black-painted railings. Discreet concealed lights illuminated the outside of the high white Victorian building, the huge pillars of the facade, the steps up to the front door. This was the repository of so many of the world's treasures, looted and found and rescued and donated over hundreds of years.They reached a gate in the railings. Door grabbed it with both hands and pushed against it. Nothing happened. ""Can't you make it open?"" asked Richard.""What does it look like I'm trying to do?"" she snapped back, an unfamiliar edge to her voice. A few hundred feet down the pavement, at the main gate, large cars were drawing up, couples in smart clothes were climbing out, walking along the drive toward the museum.""Down there,"" said Richard. ""The main gate.""Door nodded. She looked behind them. ""Those two don't seem to be following us,"" she said. They hurried toward the main gate.""Are you all right?"" asked Richard. ""What happened just then?""Door hunched deep into her leather jacket. She was looking paler than usual, which was extremely pale indeed, and there were dark semicircles beneath her eyes. ""I'm tired,"" she said, flatly. ""Opened too many doors today. Takes a lot out of me, each time. I need a little time to recover. Something to eat, and I'll be fine.""There was a guard on the gate, minutely examining the engraved invitations that each of the well-shaven men in dinner jackets and the fragrant women in evening dresses needed to present, then ticking their names off on a list, before allowing them through. A uniformed policeman beside him surveyed the guests implacably. Richard and Door walked through the gate, and no one glanced at them twice. There was a line of people standing on the stone steps that led up to the museum doors, and Richard and Door joined the line. A white-haired man, accompanied by a woman bravely wearing a mink coat, joined the line immediately and neatly behind them. A thought struck Richard. ""Can they see us?"" he asked.Door turned to the gentleman behind them in the line. She stared up at him. ""Hello,"" she said.The man looked around, a puzzled expression on his face, as if he was unsure what had attracted his attention. Then he caught sight of Door, standing just in front of him. ""Hello . . . ?"" he said.""I'm Door,"" she told him. ""This is Richard.""""Oh . . . "" said the man. Then he fumbled in an inner pocket, pulled out a cigar case, and forgot all about them. ""There. See?"" said Door.""I think so,"" he replied. They said nothing for some time, as the line moved slowly toward the single open glass door at the museum's main entrance. Door looked at the writing on her scroll, as if she needed to reassure herself of something. Then Richard said, ""A traitor?""""They were just winding us up,"" said Door. ""Trying to upset us.""""Doing a bloody good job of it, too,"" said Richard. And they walked through the open door, and then they were in the British Museum.Mr. Vandemar was hungry, so they walked back through Trafalgar Square.""Scare her,"" muttered Mr. Croup, disgustedly. ""Scare her. That we should be brought to this.""Mr. Vandemar had found half a shrimp and lettuce sandwich in a garbage can, and was gently tearing it into small pieces, which he was tossing down onto the flagstones in front of him, attracting a small flock of hungry late-night pigeons. ""Should have followed my idea,"" said Mr. Vandemar. ""Would have scared her lots more if I'd pulled his head off while she wasn't looking, then put my hand up through his throat and wiggled my fingers about. They always scream,"" he confided, ""when the eyeballs fall out."" He demonstrated with his right hand.Mr. Croup was having none of it. ""Why get so squeamish at this stage in the game?"" he asked.""I'm not squeamish, Mister Croup,"" said Mr. Vandemar. ""I like it when the eyeballs fall out. Peepers and tarriwags."" More gray pigeons strutted over to peck at the fragments of bread and shrimp, and to disregard the lettuce.""Not you,"" said Mr. Croup. ""The boss. Kill her, kidnap her, scare her. Why doesn't he make up his mind?""Mr. Vandemar ran out of the sandwich he had been using as bait, and now he made a dash into the crowd of pigeons, who took to the wing with some clacking noises and the occasional grumbling coo. ""Well caught, Mister Vandemar,"" said Mr. Croup, approvingly. Mr. Vandemar was holding a surprised and upset pigeon, which grumbled and fidgeted in his grasp and pecked ineffectively at his fingers.Mr. Croup sighed, dramatically. ""Well, anyway. We've certainly put the cat amongst the pigeons now,"" he said, with relish. Mr. Vandemar held the pigeon up to his face. There was a crunching noise, as he bit off its head and commenced to chew.The security guards were directing the museum's guests to a hallway that seemed to be functioning as some kind of holding area. Door ignored the guards entirely and set off into the museum halls with Richard trailing along behind her. They went through the Egyptian rooms, up several flights of back stairs, and into a room marked Early English.""According to this scroll,"" she said, ""the Angelus is in this room somewhere."" Then Door looked down at her scroll some more and looked around the hall, more carefully. She made a face. ""Tch,"" she explained, and took off back down the stairs, the way they had come. Richard had an intense feeling of déjà vu, before realizing that, yes, of course this felt familiar: it was how he had spent his weekends in the Jessica days. Which were starting to seem, already, like things that had happened to someone else a long, long time ago.""The Angelus wasn't in that room, then?"" asked Richard.""No, it wasn't there,"" said Door, a little more fiercely than Richard felt the question had actually warranted.""Oh,"" he said. ""I only wondered."" They went into another room. Richard wondered if he were starting to hallucinate. ""I can hear music,"" he said. It sounded like a string quartet.""The party,"" said Door.Right. The people in the dinner jackets they had lined up with. No, the Angelus didn't seem to be here either. Door walked into the next hall, and Richard trailed in her wake. He wished he could be of more use. ""This Angelus,"" he said. ""What does it look like?""For a moment he thought she was going to reprimand him simply for asking. But she stopped, rubbed her forehead. ""This just says it's got a picture of an angel on it. But it can't be that hard to find. After all,"" she added, hopefully, ""how many things with angels on them are there here?""
NW_ch9	NW	Neverwhere	9	4226	25303	NeverwhereNINEJessica was under a little pressure. She was worried, and nervous, and jittery. She had catalogued the collection, arranged with the British Museum to host the exhibition, organized the restoration of the prime exhibit, assisted in hanging and exhibiting the collection, and put together the list of invitees to the fabulous launch. It was just as well she didn't have a boyfriend, she would tell her friends. There'd be no time for one even if she had one. Still, it would be nice, she thought, when she got a moment: someone to go to galleries with on the weekends. Someone to . . .No. She did not go to that place in her head. She could no more pin it down than she could put her finger on a bead of mercury, and she refocused on the exhibition. Even now, at the last minute, there were so many things that could go wrong. Many a horse had fallen at the final hurdle. Many an overconfident general had seen certain victory turn to defeat in the closing minutes of a battle. Jessica was simply going to ensure that nothing went wrong. She was wearing a green silk dress, an off-the-shoulder general marshalling her troops and stoically pretending that Mr. Stockton was not half an hour late.Her troops consisted of a head waiter, a dozen serving staff, three women from the caterers, a string quartet, and her assistant, a young man named Clarence.She inspected the drinks table. ""We're fine for champagne? Yes?"" The head waiter pointed to the crate of champagne beneath the table. ""And sparkling mineral water?"" Another nod. Another crate. Jessica pursed her lips. ""What about plain mineral water? Bubbles aren't everybody's cup of tea, you know."" They had plenty of plain mineral water. Good.The string quartet was warming up. They were not quite loud enough to drown the noise coming from the hallway outside. It was the noise of a small but affluent crowd: the grumbling of ladies in mink coats, and men, who, were it not for the NO SMOKING signs on the walls-and perhaps the advice of their doctors-would be smoking cigars; the grumbling of journalists and celebrities who could smell the canapes, vol-au-vents, sundry nibbles, and free champagne.Clarence was talking to someone on his portable phone, a slimline piece of fold-out engineering that made the Star Trek communicators look bulky and old-fashioned. He turned it off, pushed down the antenna, put it into the Armani pocket of his Armani suit, where it did not even make a bulge. He smiled, reassuringly. ""Jessica, Mister Stockton's driver's phoned from the car. They're still running a couple of minutes late. Nothing to worry about.""""Nothing to worry about,"" echoed Jessica. Doomed. Doomed. The whole thing was going to be a disaster. Her disaster. She picked up a glass of champagne from the table, emptied it, and handed the empty glass to the wine waiter.Clarence tipped his head on one side, listening to the grumbling reverberation from the hallway outside. The crowd wanted in. He looked at his watch, then looked at Jessica questioningly, a captain querying his general. Into the Valley of Death, then, boss? ""Mister Stockton is on his way, Clarence,"" Jessica said, calmly. ""He has requested a private viewing before the event begins.""""Shall I go out and see how they're doing?""""No,"" she said, decisively. Then, just as decisively, ""Yes."" Food and drink dealt with, Jessica turned to the string quartet and asked them, for the third time that evening, exactly what they planned to play.Clarence opened the double doors to check on the crowd. It was worse than he had thought: there had to be more than a hundred people in the hall. And they weren't just people. They were People. Some of them were even Personalities.""Excuse me,"" said the chairman of the Arts Council. ""The invitations said eight o'clock sharp. It's twenty past eight already.""""We'll just be a few more minutes,"" reassured Clarence, smoothly. ""Security arrangements.""A woman in a hat bore down on him. Her voice was stentorian, bullying, and decidedly parliamentary. ""Young man,"" she announced. ""Do you know who I am?""""Not really, no,"" lied Clarence, who knew exactly who all of them were. ""Hold on-I'll see if anyone in here does."" He shut the door behind him. ""Jessica? They're going to riot.""""Don't exaggerate, Clarence."" She was moving around the room like a green silk whirlwind, positioning her serving staff, with their trays of canapes or drinks, in strategic corners of the hall; checking the public-address system, the podium, the curtain, and the pull-rope. ""I can see the headlines now,"" said Clarence, unfolding an imaginary newspaper. "" 'Geritol Billionaires Crush Marketing Babe in Museum Canape Dash Horror.' ""Somebody began knocking at the door. The volume in the hallway began to increase. Somebody was saying, very loudly, ""Excuse me. Um. Excuse me."" Someone else was informing the crowd that it was a disgrace, quite simply a disgrace, no other word for it. ""Executive decision,"" said Clarence, suddenly. ""I'm letting them in.""Jessica shouted, ""No! If you-""But it was too late. The doors were open, and the horde was pushing its way into the hall. The expression on Jessica's face morphed from one of horror to one of charmed delight. She shimmered toward the door. ""Baroness,"" she said, with a happy smile. ""I can't tell you how delighted we are that you were able to come to our little exhibition this evening. Mister Stockton's been unavoidably delayed, but he'll be here momentarily. Please, have some canapes . . . "" Over the baroness's mink-draped shoulder, Clarence winked at her, cheerfully. Jessica ran through all the bad words she knew in her head. As soon as the baroness had headed for the vol-au-vents, Jessica walked over to Clarence and, in a whisper, and still smiling, called him several of them.Richard froze. A security guard was coming straight toward them, the beam of his flashlight flashing from side to side. Richard looked around for somewhere to hide.Too late. Another guard was walking their way, past the huge statues of dead Greek gods, flashlight beam swinging. ""All right?"" called the first guard. The other guard kept coming, and stopped just beside Richard and Door.""I suppose,"" she said. ""I've already had to stop a couple of idiots in suits from carving their initials on the Rosetta stone. I hate these functions.""The first guard shone his flashlight straight into Richard's eyes, then let the beam slide off, skittering over shadows. ""I keep telling you,"" he said, with the satisfied relish of any true prophet, ""it's The Masque of the Red Death all over again. A decadent elite party, while civilization crumbles about their ears."" He picked his nose, wiped it on the leather sole of his well-polished black boot.The second guard sighed. ""Thank you, Gerald. Right, back on patrol.""The guards walked out of the hall together. ""Last one of these events we found someone had puked in a sarcophagus,"" said one of the guards, and then the door closed behind them.""If you're part of London Below,"" said Door to Richard, in a conversational voice, as they walked, side by side, into the next hall, ""they normally don't even notice you exist unless you stop and talk to them. And even then, they forget you pretty quickly.""""But I saw you,"" said Richard. It had been bothering him for a while.""I know,"" said Door. ""Isn't that odd?""""Everything's odd,"" said Richard, with feeling. The string music was getting louder. The surges of anxiety were somehow worse up here in London Above, where he was forced to reconcile these two universes. At least below, he could just proceed dreamlike, putting one foot in front of the other like a sleepwalker.""The Angelus is through there,"" announced Door, interrupting his reverie, pointing to the direction from which the music was coming.""How do you know?""""I know,"" she said, with utter certainty. ""Come on."" They stepped out of the darkness into a lighted corridor. There was a huge sign hanging across the corridor. It said:ANGELS OVER ENGLAND AN EXHIBITION AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM Sponsored by Stocktons PLCThey crossed the corridor and walked through an open door, into a large room in which a party was going on.There was a string quartet playing, and a number of serving staff were providing a roomful of well-dressed people with food and drink. There was a small stage in one corner of the room, with a podium on it, beside a high curtain.The room was completely filled with angels.There were statues of angels on tiny plinths. There were paintings of angels on the walls. There were angel frescoes. There were huge angels and tiny angels, stiff angels and amiable angels, angels with wings and haloes and angels with neither, warlike angels and peaceable angels. There were modern angels and classical angels. Hundreds upon hundreds of angels of every size and shape. Western angels, Middle Eastern angels, Eastern angels. Michelangelo angels. Joel Peter Witkin angels, Picasso angels, War-hoi angels. Mr. Stockton's angel collection was ""indiscriminate to the point of trashiness, but certainly impressive in its eclecticism"" (Time Out).""Would you think,"" Richard asked, ""that I was being picky if I pointed out that trying to find something with an angel on it in here is going to be like trying to find a needle in an oh my God it's Jessica."" Richard felt the blood drain from his face. Until now he had thought that that was simply a figure of speech. He hadn't thought it actually happened in real life.""Someone you knew?"" asked Door. Richard nodded. ""She was my. Well. We were going to be married. We've been together for a couple of years. She was with me when I found you. She was the one on the. She left that message. On the answering machine."" He pointed across the room: Jessica was making animated conversation with Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, Bob Geldof, and a bespectacled gentleman who looked suspiciously like a Saatchi. Every few minutes she checked her watch and glanced toward the door.""Her?"" said Door, recognizing the woman. Then, obviously feeling that she should say something nice about someone Richard had cared for, she said, ""Well, she's very . . . "" and she paused, and thought, and then said, "" . . . clean.""Richard stared across the room. ""Will she . . . is she going to be upset that we're here?""""I doubt it,"" said Door. ""Frankly, unless you do something stupid, like talk to her, she probably won't even notice you."" And then, with more enthusiasm, she said, ""Food!"" She descended on the canapes like a small, smut-nosed girl in a too-large leather jacket who had not eaten properly for sometime. Enormous quantities of food were immediately crammed into her mouth, masticated and swallowed, while, at the same time, the more substantial sandwiches were wrapped in paper napkins and placed into her pockets. Then, with a paper plate heaped high with chicken legs, melon slices, mushroom vol-au-vents, caviar puffs, and small venison sausages, she began to circle the room, staring intently at each and every angelic artefact.Richard trailed along behind her, with a Brie and fennel sandwich and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.Jessica was deeply puzzled. She had noticed Richard, and having noticed him, she had noticed Door. There was something familiar about them both: it was like a tickle at the back of her throat, impossible to get rid of, utterly irritating.It reminded Jessica of something her mother had once told her about, of how Jessica's mother had, one evening, encountered a woman she had known all her life-had been to school with, had served on the parish council with-and how her mother, encountering the woman at a party, had suddenly realized that she was unable to recall the woman's name, although she knew the woman had a husband in publishing named Eric and a golden retriever named Major. It had left Jessica's mother quite disgruntled.It was driving Jessica to distraction. ""Who are those people?"" she asked Clarence.""Them? Well, he's the new editor of Vogue, she's the arts correspondent of the New York Times. The one between them is Kate Moss, I think . . . """"No, not them,"" said Jessica. ""Them. There.""Clarence looked in the place that she was pointing. Hm? Oh. Them. He couldn't understand how he had failed to see them before. Old age, he thought; he would soon be twenty-three. ""Journalists?"" he said, without much conviction. ""They do look rather trendoid. Grunge chic? Please. I know I invited The Face . . . """"I know him,"" said Jessica, frustrated. Then Mr. Stockton's chauffeur phoned from Holborn to say that he was almost at the British Museum, and Richard slid out of her head, like mercury trickling through her fingers.""See anything?"" asked Richard. Door shook her head and swallowed a mouthful of hastily chewed chicken leg. ""It's like playing 'Spot the Pigeon' in Trafalgar Square,"" she said. ""There's nothing that feels like the Angelus. The paper said I'd know it if I saw it."" And she wandered off, inspecting angels, pushing her way past a Captain of Industry, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the Highest-Paid Call Girl in the South of England. Richard turned away and found himself face-to-face with Jessica. Her hair was piled on her head, and it framed her face perfectly in corkscrews of chestnut curls. She was very beautiful. She was smiling at him; it was the smile that did it. ""Hello Jessica,"" he said. ""How are you?""""Hello. You won't believe this,"" she said, ""but my assistant failed to make a note of your newspaper, Mister uh.""""Paper?"" said Richard.""Did I say newspaper?"" said Jessica, with a tinkling, sweet, and self-deprecating laugh. ""Magazine . . . television station. You are with the media?""""You're looking very fine, Jessica,"" said Richard.""You have the advantage of me,"" she said, smiling roguishly.""You're Jessica Bartram. You're a marketing executive at Stocktons. You're twenty-six. Your birthday is April the twenty-third, and in the throes of extreme passion you have a tendency to hum the Monkees song 'I'm a Believer' . . . ""Jessica was no longer smiling. ""Is this some kind of joke?"" she asked, coldly.""Oh, and we've been engaged for the last eighteen months,"" said Richard.Jessica smiled nervously. Perhaps this really was some kind of joke: one of those jokes that everyone else seemed to get and she never did. ""I rather think I'd know if I'd been engaged to someone for eighteen months, Mister um,"" said Jessica.""Mayhew,"" said Richard helpfully. ""Richard Mayhew. You dumped me, and I don't exist anymore.""Jessica waved, urgently, at no one in particular all the way across the room. ""Be right there,"" she called, desperately, and she began to back away.""I'm a believer,"" sang Richard, cheerfully, ""I couldn't leave her if I tried . . . ""Jessica snatched a glass of champagne from a passing tray, downed it in a gulp. At the far end of the room she could see Mr. Stockton's chauffeur, and where Mr. Stockton's chauffeur was . . .She headed toward the doors. ""So who was he?"" asked Clarence, edging alongside her.""Who?""""Your mystery man.""""I don't know"" she admitted. Then she said, ""Look, maybe you ought to call security.""""Okay. Why?""""Just . . . just get me security,"" and then Mr. Arnold Stockton entered the hall, and everything else went out of her head.Expansive, he was, and expensive, a Hogarth cartoon of a man, enormous of girth, many-chinned and broad-stomached. He was over sixty; his hair was gray and silver, and it was cut too long in the back, because it made people uncomfortable that his hair was too long, and Mr. Stockton liked making people uncomfortable. Compared to Arnold Stockton, Rupert Murdoch was a shady little pipsqueak, and the late Robert Maxwell was a beached whale. Arnold Stockton was a pit bull, which was how caricaturists often chose to draw him. Stocktons owned a little bit of everything: satellites, newspapers, record companies, amusement parks, books, magazines, comics, television stations, film companies.""I'll make the speech now,"" said Mr. Stockton, to Jessica, by way of introduction. ""Then I'll bugger off. Come back some other time, when there aren't all these stuffed shirts about.""""Right,"" said Jessica. ""Yes. The speech now. Of course.""And she led him up onto the little stage, up to the podium. She tinked her fingernail against a glass, for silence. Nobody heard her, so she said, ""Excuse me,"" into the microphone. This time the conversation quieted. ""Ladies and gentlemen. Honored guests. I'd like to welcome all of you to the British Museum,"" she said, ""to the Stockton-sponsored exhibition 'Angels over England,' and to the man behind it all, our chief executive and chairman of the board, Mister Arnold Stockton."" The guests applauded, none of them in any doubt as to who had assembled the collection of angels, or, for that matter, paid for their champagne.Mr. Stockton cleared his throat. ""Okay,"" he said. ""This won't take long. When I was a small boy, I used to come to the British Museum on Saturdays, because it was free, and we didn't have much money. But I'd come up the big steps to the museum, and I'd come down to this room round the back and look up at this angel. It was like it knew what I was thinking.""Just at that moment, Clarence came back in, a couple of security guards beside him. He pointed to Richard, who had stopped to listen to Mr. Stockton's speech. Door was still examining exhibits. ""No, him,"" Clarence kept saying to the guards, in an undertone. ""No, look, there. Yes? Him.""""Anyway. Like anything that's not cared for,"" continued Mr. Stockton, ""it decayed, fell apart under the stresses and strains of modern times. Went rotten. Went bad. Well, it's taken a shitload of money,"" he paused, to let it sink in-if he, Arnold Stockton, thought it was a shitload, then a shitload it certainly was-""and a dozen craftsmen have spent a great deal of time restoring it and fixing it up. After this the exhibition'll be going to America, and then around the world, so it maybe can inspire some other little penniless brat to start his own communications empire.""He looked around. Turning to Jessica, he muttered, ""What do I do now?"" She pointed to the pull-rope, at the side of the curtain. Mr. Stockton pulled the rope. The curtain billowed and opened, revealing an old door behind it.Again, there was a small flurry of activity in Clarence's corner of the room. ""No. Him,"" said Clarence. ""For heaven's sake. Are you blind?""It looked like it had once been the door to a cathedral. It was the height of two men, and wide enough for a pony to walk through. Carved into the wood of the door, and painted with red and white and gold leaf, was an extraordinary angel. It stared out at the world with blank medieval eyes. There was an impressed gasp from the guests, then they began to applaud.""The Angelus."" Door tugged at Richard's sleeve. ""That's it! Richard, come on."" She ran for the stage.""Excuse me, sir,"" said a guard to Richard. ""Might we see your invitation?"" said another, taking Richard firmly but discreetly by the arm. ""And do you have any identification?""""No,"" said Richard.Door was up on the stage. Richard tried to yank free and follow her, hoping that the guards would forget about him. They didn't: now that he had been brought to their attention they were going to proceed to treat him as they might any other shabby, unwashed, somewhat unshaven gate-crasher. The guard who was holding Richard increased his grip on his arm, muttering, ""None of that.""Door paused on the stage, wondering how to make the guards let Richard go. Then she did the only thing she could think of. She went over to the microphone, went up on tiptoes, and she screamed, as loudly as she possibly could, into the public-address system. She had a remarkable scream: it could, with no artificial assistance, go through your head like a new power drill with a bone-saw attachment. And amplified . . . It was simply unearthly.A waitress dropped her tray of drinks. Heads turned. Hands covered ears. All conversation stopped. People stared at the stage in puzzlement and horror. And Richard made a break for it. ""Sorry,"" he said to the stunned guard, as he yanked his arm out of the man's grip, and fled. ""Wrong London."" He reached the stage, grabbed Door's outstretched left hand. Her right hand touched the Angelus, the enormous cathedral door. Touched it, and opened it.This time no one dropped any drinks. They were frozen, staring, utterly overwhelmed-and, momentarily, blinded. The Angelus had opened, and light, from behind the door, had flooded the room with radiance. People covered their eyes then, hesitantly, opened them again, and simply stared. It was as if fireworks had been let off in the room. Not indoor fireworks, strange crawling things that sputter and smell bad; nor even the kind of fireworks that you set off in your back yard; but the kind of industrial-strength fireworks that get fired up high enough to cause a potential menace to the airways: the kind of fireworks that end a day at Disney World, or that give the fire marshals headaches at Pink Floyd concerts. It was a moment of pure magic.The audience stared, entranced and amazed. The only noise to be heard was the gentle, gasping almost-groan of wonderment that people make when they watch fireworks: the sound of awe. Then a grubby young man and a dirty-faced girl in a huge leather jacket walked into the light show and vanished. The door closed, behind them. The light show was over.And everything was normal again. The guests, and guards, and serving staff, blinked, shook their respective heads, and, having dealt with something entirely outside of their experience, agreed, somehow, without a word, that it had simply never happened. The string quartet began to play once more.Mr. Stockton walked off, nodding brusquely to various acquaintances as he did so. Jessica walked over, to Clarence. ""What,"" she asked, quietly, ""are those security guards doing in here?""The guards in question were standing among the guests, looking around as if they were themselves unsure what they were doing there. Clarence began to explain just what the guards were doing there; and then he realized he had absolutely no idea. ""I'll deal with it,"" said Clarence, efficiently.Jessica nodded. She looked out over her party and smiled benignly. It was all going rather well.Richard and Door walked into the light. And then it was dark, and chill, and Richard was blinking at the retinal afterimage of the light, which left him almost blinded: a ghostly series of orange-green splotches that slowly faded, as his eyes accustomed themselves to the darkness that surrounded them.They were in a huge hall, carved from rock. Iron pillars, black and rust-dusted, held up the roof, went off into the distant dark, perhaps for miles. From somewhere he could hear the gentle splash of water: a fountain, perhaps, or a spring. Door was still holding his hand, tightly. In the distance, a tiny flame flickered and flared. And another, and then another: it was a host of candles, flickering into flame, Richard realized. And walking toward them, through the candles, was a tall figure, dressed in a simple white robe.The figure seemed to be moving slowly, but it must have been walking very fast, as it was only seconds before it was standing beside them. It had golden hair and a pale face. It was not much taller than Richard, but it made him feel like a little child. It was not a man; it was not a woman. It was very beautiful. Its voice was quiet. It said, ""The Lady Door, yes?""Door said, ""Yes.""A gentle smile. It nodded its head to her, almost humbly. ""It is an honor finally to meet you and your companion. I am the Angel Islington."" Its eyes were clear and wide. Its robes were not white, as Richard had initially thought: they seemed to have been woven from light.Richard did not believe in angels, he never had. He was damned if he was going to start now. Still, it was much easier not to believe in something when it was not actually looking directly at you and saying your name. ""Richard Mayhew,"" it said. ""You, too, are welcome here, in my halls."" It turned away. ""Please,"" it said. ""Follow me.""Richard and Door followed the angel through the caverns. The candles extinguished themselves behind them.The marquis de Carabas strode through the empty hospital, broken glass and old syringes crunching beneath his square-toed black motorcycle boots. He stepped through a double door that led into a back staircase. He went down the stair's, to the cellars beneath the hospital.He walked through the rooms beneath the building, stepping fastidiously around the heaps of moldering rubbish. He walked through the showers and the toilets, down an old iron staircase, through a wet, swampy place; and then pulled open a half-rotted wooden door, and went inside. He looked around the room in which he found himself; he inspected, with magnificent disdain, the half-eaten kitten and the heap of razor blades. Then he cleared the debris off a chair, sat down, comfortably, luxuriantly, in the dankness of the cellar, and closed his eyes.Eventually the door to the cellar was opened and people came in.The marquis de Carabas opened his eyes and yawned. Then he flashed Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar a huge smile. ""Hello boys,"" said de Carabas. ""I thought it high time I came down here to talk to you in person.""
NW_ch10	NW	Neverwhere	10	7162	41188	NeverwhereTEN""Do you drink wine?"" it asked.Richard nodded.""I had a little wine once,"" said Door, hesitantly. ""My father. He. At dinner. Would let us taste it.""The Angel Islington lifted the bottle: it looked like some kind of decanter. Richard wondered if the bottle was made of glass; it refracted and reflected the candlelight so strangely. Perhaps it was some kind of crystal, or one huge diamond. It even made it seem that the wine inside was glowing, as if it were made of light.The angel took the top off the crystal and poured an inch of the liquid inside it into a wine glass. It was a white wine, but a wine unlike any Richard had ever seen. It threw light around the caverns, like sunlight on a swimming pool.Door and Richard sat around an age-blackened wooden table, on huge wooden chairs, and said nothing. ""This wine,"" said Islington, ""is the last bottle of its kind. I was given a dozen bottles by one of your ancestors.""It handed the glass to Door, and began to pour another inch of the glowing wine from the decanter into another glass. It did this reverently, almost lovingly, like a priest performing a ritual. ""It was a welcome gift. This was, oh, thirty, forty thousand years ago. Quite a while ago, at any rate."" It passed the wine glass to Richard. ""I suppose that you could accuse me of squandering something I should treasure,"" it told them. ""But I receive guests so rarely. And the way here is hard.""""The Angelus . . . "" murmured Door.""You traveled here using the Angelus, yes. But that way works only once for each traveler."" The angel raised its glass high, staring at the light. ""Drink it carefully,"" it advised them. ""It is most potent."" It sat down at the table, between Richard and Door. ""When one tastes it,"" it said, wistfully, ""I like to imagine that one is actually tasting the sunlight of bygone days."" It held up its glass. ""A toast: to former glories.""""Former glories,"" chorused Richard and Door. And then, a little warily, they tasted the wine, sipping it, not drinking.""It's amazing,"" said Door.""It really is,"" said Richard. ""I thought old wines turned to vinegar when they were exposed to air.""The angel shook its head. ""Not this one. It is all a matter of the type of grape and the place it was grown. This kind of grape, alas, perished when the vineyard vanished beneath the waves.""""It's magical,"" said Door, sipping the liquid light. ""I've never tasted anything like it.""""And you never will again,"" said Islington. ""There is no more wine from Atlantis.""Somewhere inside Richard a small, reasonable voice pointed out that there never was an Atlantis, and, thus emboldened, went on to state that there were no such things as angels, and that furthermore, most of his experiences of the last few days had been impossible. Richard ignored it. He was learning, awkwardly, to trust his instincts, and to realize that the simplest and most likely explanations for what he had seen and experienced recently were the ones that had been offered to him-no matter how unlikely they might seem. He opened his mouth and tasted the wine once more. It made him feel happy. It made him think of skies bigger and bluer than any he had ever seen, a golden sun hanging huge in the sky; everything simpler, everything younger than the world he knew.There was a waterfall to the left of them; clear water ran down the rock and collected in the rock-pool. To the right of them was a door, set between two iron pillars: the door was made of polished flint set in a metal that was almost black.""You really claim to be an angel?"" Richard asked. ""I mean, you've actually met God and everything?""Islington smiled. ""I claim nothing, Richard,"" it said. ""But I am an angel.""""You honor us,"" said Door.""No. You do me much honor by coming here. Your father was a good man, Door, and a friend to me. I was deeply saddened by his death.""""He said . . . in his journal . . . he said I should come to you. He said I could trust you.""""I only hope that I can be worthy of that trust."" The angel sipped its wine. ""London Below is the second city that I have cared for. The first sank beneath the waves, and there was nothing I could do to prevent it. I know what pain is, and loss. You have my sympathies. What would you like to know?""Door paused. ""My family . . . they were killed by Croup and Vandemar. But-who ordered it? I want . . . I want to know why.""The angel nodded. ""Many secrets find their way down to me,"" it said. ""Many rumors, and half-truths, and echoes."" Then it turned to Richard. ""And you? What do you want, Richard Mayhew?""Richard shrugged. ""I want my life back. And my apartment. And my job.""""That can happen,"" said the angel.""Yeah. Right,"" said Richard flatly.""Do you doubt me, Richard Mayhew?"" asked the Angel Islington.Richard looked into its eyes. They were a luminescent gray, eyes as old as the universe, eyes that had seen galaxies congeal from stardust ten million, million years ago; Richard shook his head. Islington smiled at him, kindly. ""It will not be easy, and you and your companions will face some very real difficulties, both in the task, and in the return. But there could be a way that we can learn: a key to all of our problems.""It got up, and walked over to a small rock shelf, where it picked up a figurine, one of several on the shelf. It was a small black statuette depicting some kind of animal, made of volcanic glass. The angel handed it to Door. ""This will bring you safely through the last stage of your journey back to me,"" it said. ""The rest is up to you.""""What do you want us to do?"" asked Richard.""The Black Friars are custodians of a key,"" it said. ""Bring it to me.""""And you can use it to find out who killed my family?"" asked Door.""I hope so,"" said the angel. Richard finished his glass of wine. He felt it warming him, running through him. He had the strange feeling that if he looked down at his fingers he would be able to see the wine glowing through them. As if he were made of light . . .""Good luck,"" whispered the Angel Islington. There was a rushing sound, like a wind soughing across a lost forest, or the beating of mighty wings.Richard and Door were sitting on the floor in a room in the British Museum, staring up at a carved painting of an angel on a cathedral door. The room was dark and empty. The party had been over for a long time. The sky outside was beginning to lighten. Richard stood up, then leaned down, and helped Door up.""Black Friars?"" he asked. Door nodded.He had crossed Blackfriars Bridge, in the City of London, many times, and he had often passed through Blackfriars station, but he had learned by now not to assume anything. ""People.""Richard walked over to the Angelus. He ran a finger down its painted robe. ""Do you think he can really do it? Get me my life back?""""I've never heard of such a thing. But I don't think he would have lied to us. He is an angel.""Door opened her hand, looked at the statue of the Beast. ""My father had one of these,"" she said, sadly. She put it deep in one of the pockets of her brown leather jacket.""Well,"" said Richard. ""We're not going to get the key back by lollygagging around here, are we?"" They walked through the empty museum corridors.""So what do you know about this key then?"" asked Richard.""Nothing,"" said Door. They had reached the main doors of the museum. ""I've heard of the Black Friars, but I've never actually had anything to do with them."" She pressed her fingers against a seriously locked glass door, which swung open at her touch.""A bunch of monks . . . "" said Richard, thoughtfully. ""I bet if we just tell them it's for an angel, a real one, they'll give us the sacred key, and-and throw in the magic can-opener and the amazing whistling corkscrew, as a surprise bonus."" He began to laugh. He wondered if the wine was still affecting him.""You're in good spirits,"" said Door.He nodded, enthusiastically. ""I'm going to go home. Everything is going to be normal again. Boring again. Wonderful again."" Richard looked at the stone steps that lead up the British Museum, and decided that they were made to be danced down by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. And seeing that neither of them happened to be available, he began to dance down the steps, doing a Fred Astaire impersonation, while humming something approximately halfway between ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" and ""Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails."" ""Ya-ta-ta-da-da-ta-ta-ya,"" he sang, soft-shoeing down the steps and up again.Door stood at the top of the steps, staring at him in horror. Then she began to giggle, helplessly. He looked up at her and doffed his imaginary white silk top hat to her, mimed tossing it high in the air, catching it, and putting it back on his head.""Twit,"" said Door, and smiled at him. In response, Richard grabbed her hand and continued dancing up and down the steps. Door hesitated for a moment, then she, too, began to dance. She danced much better than Richard did. At the bottom of the steps they tumbled, breathless and exhausted and giggling, into each other's arms.Richard felt his world spin.He felt her heart beating against his chest. The moment began to transmute, and he wondered if there was something he should do. He wondered if he should kiss her. He wondered if he wanted to kiss her, and he realized that he truly did not know. He looked into her amazing eyes. Door put her head on one side, and pulled free. She pulled up the collar on her brown leather jacket, pulled it around her: armor and protection.""Let's go and find our bodyguard,"" said Door. And they walked away together, down the sidewalk, toward British Museum Station, stumbling only a little from time to time.""What,"" asked Mr. Croup, ""do you want?""""What,"" asked the marquis de Carabas, a little more rhetorically, ""does anyone want?""""Dead things,"" suggested Mr. Vandemar. ""Extra teeth.""""I thought perhaps we could make a deal,"" said the marquis.Mr. Croup began to laugh. It sounded like a piece of blackboard being dragged over the nails of a wall of severed fingers. ""Oh, Messire Marquis. I think I can confidently state, with no risk of contradiction from any parties here present, that you have taken leave of whatever senses you are reputed to have had. You are,"" he confided, ""if you will permit the vulgarism, completely off your head.""""Say the word,"" said Mr. Vandemar, who was now standing behind the marquis's chair, ""and it'll be off his neck before you can say Jack Ketch.""The marquis breathed heavily on his fingernails and polished them on the lapel of his coat. ""I have always felt,"" he said, ""that violence was the last refuge of the incompetent, and empty threats the final sanctuary of the terminally inept.""Mr. Croup glared. ""What are you doing here?"" he hissed.The marquis de Carabas stretched, like a big cat: a lynx, perhaps, or a huge black panther; and at the end of the stretch he was standing up, with his hands thrust deep in the pockets of his magnificent coat. ""You are,"" he said, idly and conversationally, ""I understand, Mister Croup, a collector of T'ang dynasty figurines.""""How did you know that?""""People tell me things. I'm approachable."" The marquis's smile was pure, untroubled, guileless: the smile of a man selling you a used Bible.""Even if I were . . . "" began Mr. Croup.""If you were,"" said the marquis de Carabas, ""you might be interested in this."" He took one hand out of his pocket and displayed it to Mr. Croup. Until earlier that evening it had sat in a glass case in the vaults of one of London's leading merchant banks. It was listed in certain catalogues as The Spirit of Autumn (Grave Figure). It was roughly eight inches high: a piece of glazed pottery that had been shaped and painted and fired while Europe was in the Dark Ages, six hundred years before Columbus's first voyage.Mr. Croup hissed, involuntarily, and reached for it. The marquis pulled it out of reach, cradled it to his chest. ""No no,"" said the marquis. ""It's not as simple as that.""""No?"" asked Mr. Croup. ""But what's to stop us taking it, and leaving pieces of you all over the Underside? We've never dismembered a marquis before.""""Have,"" said Mr. Vandemar. ""In York. In the fourteenth century. In the rain.""""He wasn't a marquis,"" said Mr. Croup. ""He was the earl of Exeter.""""And marquis of Westmorland."" Mr. Vandemar looked rather pleased with himself.Mr. Croup sniffed. ""What's to stop us hacking you into as many pieces as we hacked the marquis of Westmorland?"" he asked.De Carabas took his other hand out of his pocket. It held a small hammer. He tossed the hammer in the air and caught it by the handle, ending with the hammer poised over the china figurine. ""Oh, please,"" he said. ""No more silly threats. I think I'd feel better if you were both standing back over there.""Mr. Vandemar shot a look at Mr. Croup, who nodded, almost imperceptibly. There was a tremble in the air, and Mr. Vandemar was standing beside Mr. Croup, who smiled like a skull. ""I have indeed been known to purchase the occasional T'ang piece,"" he admitted. ""Is that for sale?""""We don't go in so much for buying and selling here in the Underside, Mister Croup. Barter. Exchange. That's what we look for. But yes, indeed, this desirable little piece is certainly up for grabs.""Mr. Croup pursed his lips. He folded his arms. He unfolded them. He ran one hand through his greasy hair. Then, ""Name your price,"" said Mr. Croup. The marquis let himself breathe a deep, relieved, and almost audible sigh. It was possible that he was going to be able to pull this whole grandiose ruse off, after all. ""First, three answers to three questions,"" he said.Croup nodded. ""Each way. We get three answers too.""""Fair enough,"" said the marquis. ""Secondly, I get safe conduct out of here. And you agree to give me at least an hour's head start.""Croup nodded violently. ""Agreed. Ask your first question."" His gaze was fixed on the statue.""First question. Who are you working for?""""Oh, that's an easy one,"" said Mr. Croup. ""That's a simple answer. We are working for our employer, who wishes to remain nameless.""""Hmph. Why did you kill Door's family?""""Orders from our employer,"" said Mr. Croup, his smile becoming more foxy by the moment.""Why didn't you kill Door, when you had a chance?""Before Mr. Croup could answer, Mr. Vandemar said, ""Got to keep her alive. She's the only one that can open the door.""Mr. Croup glared up at his associate. ""That's it,"" he said. ""Tell him everything, why don't you?""""I wanted a turn,"" muttered Mr. Vandemar.""Right,"" said Mr. Croup. ""So you've got three answers, for all the good that will do you. My first question: why are you protecting her?""""Her father saved my life,"" said the marquis, honestly. ""I never paid off my debt to him. I prefer debts to be in my favor.""""I've got a question,"" said Mr. Vandemar.""As have I, Mr. Vandemar. The Upworlder, Richard Mayhew. Why is he traveling with her? Why does she permit it?""""Sentimentality on her part,"" said the marquis de Carabas. He wondered, as he said it, if that was the whole truth. He had begun to wonder whether there might, perhaps, be more to the upworlder than met the eye.""Now me,"" said Mr. Vandemar. ""What number am I thinking of?""""I beg your pardon?""""What number am I thinking of?"" repeated Mr. Vandemar. ""It's between one and a lot,"" he added, helpfully.""Seven,"" said the marquis. Mr. Vandemar nodded, impressed. Mr. Croup began, ""Where is the-"" but the marquis shook his head. ""Uh-uh,"" he said. ""Now we're getting greedy.""There was a moment of utter silence, in that dank cellar. Then once more water dripped, and maggots rustled; and the marquis said, ""An hour's head start, remember.""""Of course,"" said Mr. Croup. The marquis de Carabas tossed the figurine to Mr. Croup, who caught it eagerly, like an addict catching a plastic baggie filled with white powder of dubious legality. And then, without a backward glance, the marquis left the cellar.Mr. Croup examined the figurine minutely, turning it over and over in his hands, a Dickensian curator of the Museum of the Damned contemplating a prize exhibit. His tongue flicked out, from time to time, like a snake's. A perceptible flush appeared on his pallid cheeks. ""Oh, fine, fine',"" he whispered. ""T'ang dynasty indeed. Twelve hundred years old, the finest pottery figurines ever made on this earth. This was created by Kai Lung, finest of potters: there is not a twin to it in existence. Examine the color of the glaze; the sense of proportion; the life . . . "" He was smiling now, like a baby; the innocent smile looked lost and confused on the shady terrain of Mr. Croup's face. ""It adds a little wonder and beauty to the world.""And then he grinned, too widely, and lowered his face to the figurine, and crushed its head in his teeth, chomping and chewing wildly, swallowing in lumps. His teeth ground the china to a fine powder, which dusted the lower part of his face.He gloried in its destruction, throwing himself into it with the strange madness and uncontrolled blood lust of a fox in a henhouse. And then, when the statue was nothing but dust, he turned to Mr. Vandemar. He seemed strangely mellow, almost languid. ""How long did we say we'd give him?""""An hour.""""Mmm. And how long has it been?""""Six minutes.""Mr. Croup lowered his head. He ran a finger across his chin, licked the powdered clay from his fingertip. ""You follow him, Mister Vandemar,"" said Mr. Croup. ""I need a little more time in which to savor the occasion.""Hunter could hear them walking down the steps. She was standing in the shadows, with her arms folded, in the same position she had been in when they left her. Richard was humming loudly. Door was giggling helplessly; then she would stop, and tell Richard to be quiet. Then she would start giggling again. They walked past Hunter without noticing her. She stepped out of the shadows, and said, ""You have been gone for eight hours."" It was a statement of fact, without reproach or curiosity.Door blinked at her. ""It didn't seem that long."" Hunter said nothing.Richard grinned wearily at her. ""Don't you want to know what happened? Well, we got ambushed by Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar. Unfortunately we didn't have a bodyguard around. Still, I gave them a good run for their money.""Hunter raised a perfect eyebrow. ""I am in awe of your pugilistic talents,"" she said coolly.Door giggled. ""He's kidding. Actually-they killed us.""""As an expert in the termination of bodily functions,"" Hunter said, ""I must beg to differ. You are neither of you dead. At a guess, you are both very drunk.""Door stuck her tongue out at her bodyguard. ""Nonsense. Touched hardly a drop. That much."" She held out two fingers to show how tiny an amount ""that much"" was.""Just went to a party,"" said Richard, ""and saw Jessica and saw a real angel and got a little black pig and came back here.""""Just a little drink,"" continued Door, intently. ""Old, old drink. Tiiiiny little drink. Very small. Almost not there."" She began to hiccup. Then she giggled again. A hiccup interrupted her, and she sat down suddenly on the platform. ""I think maybe we are a bit smashed,"" she said, soberly. Then she closed her eyes, and began, solemnly, to snore.The marquis de Carabas was running through the underways as if all the hounds of Hell had his scent and were on his trail. He was splashing through six gray inches of the Tyburn, the hangman's river, kept safe in the darkness in a brick sewer beneath Park Lane on its way south to Buckingham Palace. He had been running for seventeen minutes.Thirty feet below Marble Arch, he paused. The sewer divided into two branches. The marquis de Carabas ran down the left-hand branch.Several minutes later, Mr. Vandemar walked through the sewer. And when he reached the junction he, too, paused for a few moments, sniffing the air. And then he, too, walked down the left-hand branch.Hunter dropped Richard Mayhew's unconscious body into a pile of straw, with a grunt. He rolled in the straw, said something that sounded like ""Forth-ril bjugly mobble wug,"" and went back to sleep. She put Door down in the straw next to him, more gently. Then she stood beside Door, in the dark stables under the ground, on guard still.The marquis de Carabas was exhausted. He leaned against the tunnel wall and stared at the steps that went up ahead of him. Then he pulled out the golden pocket-watch and looked at the time. Thirty-five minutes had passed since he had fled the hospital cellar.""Is it an hour yet?"" asked Mr. Vandemar. He was sitting on the steps ahead of the marquis, picking his nails with a knife.""Not even close,"" gasped the marquis.""Felt like an hour,"" said Mr. Vandemar, helpfully.There was a shiver in the world, and Mr. Croup stood behind the marquis de Carabas. He still had powder on his chin. De Carabas stared at Mr. Croup. He turned back to look at Mr. Vandemar. And then, spontaneously, the marquis de Carabas began to laugh. Mr. Croup smiled. ""You find us funny, Messire Marquis, do you not? A source of amusement. Is that not so? With our pretty clothes, and our convoluted circumlocutions-""Mr. Vandemar murmured, ""I haven't got a circumlo . . . """"-and our little sillinesses of manner and behavior. And perhaps we are funny.""Mr. Croup raised one finger then, and waggled it at de Carabas. ""But you must never imagine,"" he continued, ""that just because something is funny, Messire Marquis, it is not also dangerous.""And Mr. Vandemar threw his knife at the marquis, hard and accurately. It hit him, hilt first, on the temple. His eyes rolled up in his head, and his knees buckled. ""Circumlocution,"" said Mr. Croup to Mr. Vandemar. ""It's a way of speaking around something. A digression. Verbosity.""Mr. Vandemar picked up the marquis de Carabas by his waistband and dragged him up the stairs, his head bump-bump-bumping on each step as they went, and Mr. Vandemar nodded. ""I wondered,"" he said.Watching their dreams, now, as they sleep.Hunter sleeps standing up.In her dream, Hunter is in the undercity beneath Bangkok. It is partly a maze, and partly a forest, for the wilderness of Thailand has retreated deep beneath the ground, under the airport and the hotels and the streets. The world smells of spice and dried mango, and it also smells, not unpleasantly, of sex. It is humid, and she is sweating. It is dark, broken by phosphorescent patches on the wall, greenish grey fungi that give light enough to fool the eye, light enough to walk by.In her dream Hunter moves silent as a ghost through the wet tunnels, pushing her way through vegetation. She holds a weighted throwing stick in her right hand; a leather shield covers her left forearm.She smells it, in her dream, acrid and animal, and she pauses beside a wall of ruined masonry, and she waits, part of the shadows, one with the darkness. Hunting, like life, Hunter believes, consists chiefly of waiting. In Hunter's dream, however, she does not wait. Upon her arrival, it comes through the underbrush, a fury of brown and of white, undulating gently, like a wet-furred snake, its red eyes bright and peering through the darkness, its teeth like needles, a carnivore and a killer. The creature is extinct in the world above. It weighs almost three hundred pounds, and is a little over fifteen feet long, from the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail.As it passes her, she hisses like a snake, and, momentarily, old instincts kicking in, it freezes. And then it leaps at her, nothing but hate and sharp teeth. She remembers, then, in her dream, that this had happened before, and that when it had happened, that time in the past, she had pushed the leather arm-shield into its mouth and crushed its skull with the leaden throwing stick taking care not to damage the pelt. She had given the Great Weasel's pelt to a girl who had caught her eye, and the girl had been appropriately grateful.But now, in her dream, that is not happening. Instead, the weasel is reaching out a forepaw toward her, and she is dropping her throwing stick and taking its paw. And then and there, in the undercity beneath Bangkok, they are dancing together, in one intricate unending dance: and Hunter is watching them from outside herself, and she is admiring the elaborate movements they make as they move, tail and legs and arms and fingers and eyes and hair all tumbling and twisting powerfully and strangely into the underneath and out across forever.There is a tiny noise in the waking world, a dreaming whimper from the child Door, and Hunter moves from sleeping to waking fluidly and instantly; she is alert once more, and on guard. She forgets her dream entirely upon waking.Door is dreaming of her father.In her dream, he is showing her how to open things. He picks up an orange, and gestures: in one smooth movement it inverts, and twists: the orange flesh is on the outside, now, and the skin is in the center, on the inside. One must always maintain parity, her father tells her, peeling off an inside-out orange segment for her. Parity, symmetry, topology: these will be our subjects for the months to come, Door. But the most important thing for you to understand is this: all things want to open. You must feel that need, and use it. Her father's hair is brown and thick, as it was a decade before his death, and he has an easy smile, which she remembers but which time had diminished as the years went on.In her dream, he passes her a padlock. She takes it from him. Her hands are the size and shape of her hands today, although she knows that, in truth, this occurred when she was a tiny child, that she is taking moments and conversations and lessons from over a dozen years and is compressing them into one lesson. Open it, he tells her.She holds it in her hand, feeling the cold metal, feeling the weight of the lock in her hands. Something is bothering her. There is something she has to know. Door learned to open some time after she learned to walk. She remembers her mother holding her tightly, opening a door from Door's bedroom to the playroom, remembers watching her brother Arch separating linked silver rings, joining them back together.She tries to open the padlock. She fumbles at it with her fingers, and with her mind. Nothing happens. She throws the padlock down onto the floor and begins to cry. Her father reaches down and picks up the padlock, puts it back into her hand. His long finger brushes away a tear from her cheek.Remember, he tells her, the padlock wants to open. All you have to do is let it do what it wants.It sits there in her hand, cold and inert and heavy. And then, suddenly, she understands, and, somewhere in her heart, she lets it be what it wants to be. There is a loud click, and the padlock opens. Her father is smiling. There, she says.Good girl, says her father. That's all there is to opening. Everything else is just technique.She realizes what it is that is bothering her. Father? she asks. Your journal. Who put it away? Who could have hidden it? But he is receding from her, and already she is forgetting. She calls to him, but he cannot hear her, and although she can hear his voice in the distance, she can no longer make out what he is saying.In the waking world, Door whimpers softly. Then she rolls over, cradles her arm around her face, snorts once, twice, then sleeps once more, sleeps without dreaming.Richard knows it waits for them. Each tunnel he goes down, each turning, each branch he walks, the feeling grows in urgency and weight. He knows it is there, waiting, and the sense of impending catastrophe increases with every step. He knows that it should have been a relief when he turns the final corner, and sees it standing there, framed in the tunnel, waiting for him. Instead he feels only dread. In his dream it is the size of the world: there is nothing left in the world but the Beast, its flanks steaming, broken spars and juts of old weapons prickling from its hide. There is dried blood on its horns and on its tusks. It is gross, and vast, and evil. And then it charges.He raises his hand (but it isn't his hand) and he throws the spear at the creature.He sees its eyes, wet and vicious and gloating, as they float toward him, all in a fraction of a second that becomes a tiny forever. And then it is upon him . . .The water was cold, and it hit Richard's face like a slap. His eyes jerked open, and he caught his breath. Hunter was looking down at him. She was holding a large wooden bucket. It was empty. He reached up one hand. His hair was soaked, and his face was wet. He wiped the water from his eyes and shivered with cold.""You didn't have to do that,"" said Richard. His mouth tasted like several small animals had been using it as a rest room. He tried to stand, and then he sat down again, suddenly. ""Ooh,"" he explained. ""How's your head?"" asked Hunter, professionally.""It's been better,"" said Richard.Hunter picked up another wooden bucket, this one filled with water, and hauled it across the stable floor. ""I don't know what you drank,"" she said. ""But it must have been potent."" Hunter dipped her hand into the bucket and flicked it at Door's face, spraying her with water. Door's eyes flickered.""No wonder Atlantis sank,"" muttered Richard. ""If they all felt like this in the morning it was probably a relief. Where are we?""Hunter flicked another handful of water at Door's face. ""In the stables of a friend,"" she said. Richard looked around. The place did look a little like a stable. He wondered if it were for horses-and if so, what kind of horses would live beneath the ground? There was a device painted on the wall: the letter S (or was it a snake? Richard could not tell) circled by seven stars.Door reached a tentative hand up to her head and touched it, experimentally, as if she were unsure just what she might find. ""Ooh,"" she said, in a near-whisper. ""Temple and Arch. Am I dead?""""No,"" said Hunter.""Pity.""Hunter helped her to a standing position. ""Well,"" said Door, sleepily, ""he did warn us it was strong."" And then Door woke up completely, very hard, very fast. She grabbed Richard's shoulder, pointed to the device on the wall, the snaky S with the stars surrounding it. She gasped. ""Serpentine,"" she said to Richard, to Hunter. ""That's Serpentine's crest. Richard, get up! We have to run-before she finds out we're here . . . """"And do you think,"" asked a dry voice from the doorway, ""that you could enter Serpentine's house without Serpentine knowing, child?""Door pushed herself back against the wood of the stable wall. She was trembling. Richard realized, through the pounding in his head, that he had never seen Door so actually and obviously scared before. Serpentine stood in the doorway. She was wearing a white leather corset and high white leather boots, and the remains of what looked like it had once, long ago, been a silk-and-lace confection of a white wedding dress, now shredded and dirt-stained and torn. She towered above them all: her shock of graying hair brushed the door lintel. Her eyes were sharp, and her mouth was a cruel slash in an imperious face. She looked at Door as if she took terror as her due; as if she had become so used to fear that she now expected it, even liked it.""Calm yourself,"" said Hunter.""But she's Serpentine,"" wailed Door. ""Of the Seven Sisters.""Serpentine inclined her head, cordially. Then she stepped out of the doorway and walked toward them. Behind her was a thin woman with a severe face and long dark hair, wearing a black dress pinched wasp-thin at the waist. The woman said nothing. Serpentine walked over to Hunter. ""Hunter worked for me long ago,"" said Serpentine. She reached out a white finger and gently stroked Hunter's brown cheek with it, a gesture of affection and possession. And then, ""You've kept your looks better than I, Hunter."" Hunter looked down. ""Her friends are my friends, child,"" said Serpentine. ""You are Door?""""Yes,"" said Door, dry-mouthed.Serpentine turned on Richard. ""And what are you?"" she asked, unimpressed.""Richard,"" said Richard.""I am Serpentine,"" she told him, graciously.""So I gathered,"" said Richard.""There is food waiting for all of you,"" said Serpentine, ""should you wish to break your fast.""""Oh God no,"" whimpered Richard politely. Door said nothing. She was still backed against the wall, still trembling gently, like a leaf in an autumn breeze. The fact that Hunter had clearly brought them here as a safe haven was doing nothing to assuage her fear.""What is there to eat?"" asked Hunter.Serpentine looked at the-wasp-waisted woman in the doorway. ""Well?"" she asked. The woman smiled the chilliest smile Richard had ever seen cross a human face, then she said, ""Fried eggs poached eggs pickled eggs curried venison pickled onions pickled herrings smoked herrings salted herrings mushroom stew salted bacon stuffed cabbage calves-foot jelly-""Richard opened his. mouth to plead with her to stop, but it was too late. He was suddenly, violently, awfully sick.He wanted someone to hold him, to tell him that everything would be all right, that he'd soon be feeling better; someone to give him an aspirin and a glass of water, and show him back to his bed. But nobody did; and his bed was another life away. He washed the sick from his face and hands with water from the bucket. Then he washed out his mouth. Then, swaying gently, he followed the four women to breakfast.""Pass the calves-foot jelly,"" said Hunter, with her mouth full. Serpentine's dining room was on what appeared to be the smallest Underground platform that Richard had ever seen. It was about twelve feet long, and much of that space was taken up with a dinner table. A white damask cloth was laid on the table, and a formal silver dinner-service on that. The table was piled high with evil-smelling foodstuffs. The pickled quails' eggs, thought Richard, smelled the worst.His skin felt clammy, and his eyes felt like they had been put in their sockets wrong, while his skull gave him the general impression that someone had removed it while he had slept and swapped it for another two or three sizes too small. An Underground train went past a few feet from them; the wind of its passage whipped at the table. The noise of its passage went through Richard's head like a hot knife through brains. Richard groaned.""Your hero is unable to hold his wine, I see,"" observed Serpentine, dispassionately.""He's not my hero,"" said Door.""I'm afraid he is. You learn to recognize the type. Something in the eyes, perhaps."" She turned to the woman in black, who appeared to be some kind of majordomo. ""A restorative for the gentleman."" The woman smiled thinly and glided away.Door picked at a mushroom dish. ""We are very grateful for all this, Lady Serpentine,"" she said.Serpentine sniffed. ""Just Serpentine, child. I have no time for silly honorifics and imaginary titles. So. You're Portico's oldest girl.""""Yes.""Serpentine dipped her finger in the briny sauce that held what appeared to be several small eels. She licked her finger, nodded approvingly. ""I had little time for your father. All that foolishness about uniting the Underside. Stuff and nonsense. Silly man. Just asking for trouble. The last time I saw your father, I told him that if he ever came back here, I'd turn him into a blindworm."" She turned to Door. ""How is your father, by the way?""""He's dead,"" said Door.Serpentine looked perfectly satisfied. ""See?"" she said. ""My point exactly."" Door said nothing. Serpentine picked at something that was moving in her gray hair. She examined it closely, crushed it between finger and thumb, and dropped it onto the platform. Then she turned to Hunter, who was demolishing a small hill of pickled herrings. ""You're Beast-hunting then?"" she said. Hunter nodded, her mouth full. ""You'll need the spear, of course,"" said Serpentine.The wasp-waisted woman was now standing next to Richard, holding a small tray. On the tray was a small glass, containing an aggressively emerald-colored liquid. Richard stared at it, then looked at Door.""What are you giving him?"" asked Door.""Nothing that will hurt him,"" said Serpentine, with a frosty smile. ""You are guests.""Richard knocked back the green liquid, which tasted of thyme and peppermint and winter mornings. He felt it go down and prepared himself to try to keep it from coming back up again. Instead he took a deep breath and realized, with a little surprise, that his head no longer hurt, and that he was starving.Old Bailey was not, intrinsically, one of those people put in the world to tell jokes. Despite this handicap, he persisted in trying. He loved to tell shaggy-dog stories of inordinate length, which would end in a sad pun although, often as not, Old Bailey would be unable to remember it by the time he got there. The only public for Old Bailey's jokes consisted of a small captive audience of birds, who, particularly the rooks, viewed his jokes as deep and philosophical parables containing profound and penetrating insights into what it meant to be human, and who would actually ask him, from time to time, to tell them another of his amusing stories.""All right, all right, all right,"" Old Bailey was saying. ""Stop me if you've heard this one before. There was a man walked into a bar. No, he wasn't a man. That's the joke. Sorry. He was a horse. A horse . . . no . . . a piece of string. Three pieces of string. Right. Three pieces of string walk into a bar.""A huge old rook croaked a question. Old Bailey rubbed his chin, then shrugged. ""They just do. It's a joke. They can walk in the joke. He asks for a drink for himself and one for each of his friends. And the barman says, 'We don't serve pieces of string here.' To one of the pieces of string. So. It goes back to its friends and says, 'They don't serve strings here' And it's a joke, so the middle one does it too, three of them, you see, then the last one, he ties himself around the middle and he pulls the end of him all out. And he orders a drink."" The rook croaked again, sagely. ""Three drinks. Right. And the barman says, 'here, aren't you one of those pieces of string?' And he says, the piece of string, he says, 'No.'I'm a frayed knot.' Afraid not, y'see, a frayed knot. Pun. Very, very funny.""The starlings made polite noises. The rooks nodded their heads, put their heads on one side. Then the oldest rook cawed at Old Bailey. ""Another? I'm not made of hilarity, y'know. Let me think . . . ""There was a noise from the tent, a deep, pulsing noise, like the beating of a distant heart. Old Bailey hurried into his tent. The noise was coming from an old wooden chest in which Old Bailey kept those things he most prized. He opened the chest. The throbbing noise became much louder. The small silver box was sitting on the top of Old Bailey's treasures. He reached down one gnarly hand and picked it up. A red light rhythmically pulsed and glowed inside it, like a heartbeat, and shone out through the silver filigree, and through the cracks and fastenings. ""He's in trouble,"" said Old Bailey.The oldest rook cawed a question. ""No. It's not a joke. It's the marquis,"" said Old Bailey. ""He's in deep trouble.""Richard was halfway through his second plate of breakfast when Serpentine pushed her chair back from the table.""I think I have had my fill of hospitality,"" she said. ""Child, young man, good day. Hunter . . . "" she paused. Then she ran one clawlike finger along the line of Hunter's jaw. ""Hunter, you are always welcome here."" She nodded to them, imperiously, and stood up and walked away, followed by her wasp-waisted butler.""We should leave now,"" said Hunter. She stood up from the table, and Door and Richard, more reluctantly, followed her.They walked along a corridor that was too thin to allow more than one of them to pass at a time. They went up some stone steps. They crossed an iron bridge in the darkness, while Underground trains echoed by beneath them. Then they entered what seemed like an endless network of underground vaults that smelled of damp and decay, of brick and stone and time. ""That was your old boss, eh? She seemed nice enough,"" said Richard to Hunter. Hunter said nothing.Door, who had been somewhat subdued, said, ""When they want to make children behave themselves in the Underside, they tell them, 'Behave, or Serpentine will take you.' """"Oh,"" said Richard. ""And you worked for her, Hunter?""""I worked for all the Seven Sisters.""""I thought that they hadn't spoken to each other for, oh, at least thirty years,"" said Door.""Quite possibly. But they were still talking then.""""How old are you?"" asked Door. Richard was pleased she had asked; he would never have dared.""As old as my tongue,"" said Hunter, primly, ""and a little older than my teeth.""""Anyway,"" said Richard, in the untroubled tone of voice of one whose hangover had left him and who knew that, somewhere far above them, someone was having a beautiful day, ""that was okay. Nice food. And no one was trying to kill us.""""I'm sure that will remedy itself as the day goes on,"" said Hunter, accurately. ""Which way to the Black Friars, my lady?""Door paused and concentrated. ""We'll go the river way,"" she said. ""Over here.""""Is he coming round yet?"" asked Mr. Croup.Mr. Vandemar prodded the marquis's prone body with one long finger. The breathing was shallow. ""Not yet, Mister Croup. I think I broke him.""""You must be more careful with your toys, Mister Vandemar,"" said Mr. Croup.
NW_ch11	NW	Neverwhere	11	3827	21480	NeverwhereELEVEN""So what are you after?"" Richard asked Hunter. The three of them were walking, with extreme care, along the bank of an underground river. The bank was slippery, a narrow path along dark rock and sharp masonry. Richard watched with respect as the gray water rushed and tumbled, within arm's reach. This was not the kind of river you fell into and got out of again; it was the other kind.""After?""""Well,"" he said. ""Personally, I'm trying to get back to the real London, and my old life. Door wants to find out who killed her family. What are you after?"" They edged along the bank, a step at a time, Hunter in the lead. She said nothing in reply. The river slowed and fed into a small underground lake. They walked beside the water, their lamps reflecting in the black surface, their reflections smudged by the river mist. ""So what is it?"" asked Richard. He did not expect any kind of answer.Hunter's voice was quiet and intense. She did not break her step as she spoke. ""I fought in the sewers beneath New York with the great blind white alligator-king. He was thirty feet long, fat from sewage and fierce in battle. And I bested him, and I killed him. His eyes were like huge pearls in the darkness."" Her strangely accented voice echoed in the underground, twined in the mist, in the night beneath the Earth.""I fought the bear that stalked the city beneath Berlin. He had killed a thousand men, and his claws were stained brown and black from the dried blood of a hundred years, but he fell to me. He whispered words in a human tongue as he died."" The mist hung low on the lake. Richard fancied that he could see the creatures she spoke of, white shapes writhing in the vapor.""There was a black tiger in the undercity of Calcutta. A man-eater, brilliant and bitter, the size of a small elephant. A tiger is a worthy adversary. I took him with my bare hands."" Richard glanced at Door. She was listening to Hunter intently: this was news to her too, then. ""And I shall slay the Beast of London. They say his hide bristles with swords and spears and knives stuck in him by those who have tried and failed. His tusks are razors, and his hooves are thunderbolts. I will kill him, or I will die in the attempt.""Her eyes shone as she spoke of her prey. The river mist had become a thick yellow fog.A bell was struck, a little way away, three times, the sound carrying across the water. The world began to lighten. Richard thought he could see the squat shapes of buildings around them. The yellow-green fog became thicker: it tasted of ash, and soot, and the grime of a thousand urban years. It clung to their lamps, muffling the light. ""What is this?"" he asked.""London fog,"" said Hunter.""But they stopped years ago, didn't they? Clean Air Act, smokeless fuels, all that?"" Richard found himself remembering the Sherlock Holmes books of his childhood. ""What did they call them again?""""Pea-soupers,"" said Door. ""London Particulars. Thick yellow river fogs, mixed with coal-smoke and whatever rubbish was going into the air for the last five centuries. Hasn't been one in the Upworld for, oh, forty years now. We get the ghosts of them down here. Mm. Not ghosts. More like echoes."" Richard breathed in a strand of the yellow-green fog and began to cough. ""That doesn't sound good,"" said Door.""Fog in my throat,"" said Richard. The ground was becoming stickier, muddier: it sucked at Richard's feet as he walked. ""Still,"" he said, to reassure himself, ""a little fog never hurt anyone.""Door looked up at him with big pixie eyes. ""There was one in 1952 that they reckon killed four thousand people.""""People from here?"" he asked. ""Under London?""""Your people,"" said Hunter. Richard was willing to believe it. He thought about holding his breath, but the fog was getting thicker. The ground was becoming mushier. ""I don't understand,"" he asked. ""Why do you have fogs down here, when we don't have them up there anymore?""Door scratched her nose. ""There are little pockets of old time in London, where things and places stay the same, like bubbles in amber,"" she explained. ""There's a lot of time in London, and it has to go somewhere-it doesn't all get used up at once.""""I may still be hung over,"" sighed Richard. ""That almost made sense.""The abbot had known that this day would bring pilgrims. The knowledge was a part of his dreams; it surrounded him, like the darkness. So the day became one of waiting, which was, he knew, a sin: moments were to be experienced; waiting was a sin against both the time that was still to come and the moments one was currently disregarding. Still, he was waiting. Through each of the day's services, through their scant meals, the abbot was listening intently, waiting for the bell to sound, waiting to know who and how many.He found himself hoping for a clean death. The last pilgrim had lasted for almost a year, a gibbering, screaming thing. The abbot regarded his own blindness as neither a blessing nor a curse: it simply was; but even so, he had been grateful he had never been able to see the poor creature's face. Brother Jet, who had cared for the creature, still woke in the night, screaming, with its twisted face before him.The bell tolled late in the afternoon, three times. The abbot was in the shrine, on his knees, contemplating their charge. He pulled himself to his feet and made his way to the corridor, where he waited. ""Father?"" The voice was that of Brother Fuliginous.""Who guards the bridge?"" the abbot asked him. His voice was surprisingly deep and melodious for such an old man.""Sable,"" came the reply from the darkness. The abbot reached out a hand, grasped the young man's elbow, and walked beside him, slowly, through the corridors of the abbey.There was no solid ground; there was no lake. Their feet were splashing through some kind of marsh, in the yellow fog. ""This,"" announced Richard, ""is disgusting."" It was seeping through his shoes, invading his socks, and making a much closer acquaintance with his toes than Richard was entirely happy with.There was a bridge ahead of them, rising up out of the marsh. A figure, dressed in black, waited at the foot of the bridge. He wore the black robes of a Dominican monk. His skin was the dark brown of old mahogany. He was a tall man, and he held a wooden staff as tall as he was. ""Hold fast,"" he called. ""Tell me your names, and your stations.""""I am the Lady Door,"" said Door. ""I am Portico's daughter, of the House of the Arch.""""I am Hunter. I am her bodyguard.""""Richard Mayhew,"" said Richard. ""Wet.""""And you wish to pass?""Richard stepped forward. ""Yes, we do actually. We're here for a key."" The monk said nothing. He lifted his staff and pushed Richard gently in the chest with it. Richard's feet slid out from under him, and he landed in the muddy water. The monk waited a few moments, to see if Richard would swing up and begin to fight. Richard didn't. Hunter did.Richard pulled himself up from the mud, and watched, mouth open, as the monk and Hunter fought with quarter-staves. The monk was good. He was bigger than Hunter, and, Richard suspected, stronger. Hunter, on the other hand, was faster than the monk. The wooden staves clacked and whapped in the mist.The monk's staff made sudden contact with Hunter's midriff. She stumbled in the mud. He came in close-too close-as he discovered that her stumble had been a feint and her staff slammed into him, hard and precisely, on the backs of his knees, and his legs no longer held his weight. The man tumbled into the wet mud, and Hunter rested the tip of her staff on the back of his neck.""Enough,"" called a voice from the bridge.Hunter took a step back. She stood beside Richard and Door once more. She had not even broken a sweat. The big monk got up from the mud. His lip was bleeding. He bowed low to Hunter, then walked to the foot of the bridge.""Who are they, Brother Sable?"" called the voice.""The Lady Door, Lord Portico's daughter, of the House of the Arch; Hunter, her bodyguard, and Richard Mayhew, their companion,"" said Brother Sable, through bruised lips. ""She bested me in fair fight, Brother Fuliginous.""""Let them come up,"" said the voice.Hunter led the way up the bridge. At the apex of the bridge, another monk was waiting for them: Brother Fuliginous. He was younger and smaller than the first monk they had met, but he was dressed the same way. His skin was a deep, rich brown. There were other black-clad figures, just barely visible, further into the yellow fog. These were the Black Friars, then, Richard realized. The second monk stared at the three of them for a second, and then recited:""I turn my head, and you may go where you want. I turn it again, you will stay till you rot. I have no face, but I live or die by my crooked teeth-who am I?""Door took a step forward. She licked her lips and half closed her eyes. ""I turn my head . . . "" she said, puzzling to herself. ""Crooked teeth . . . go where you . . . "" Then a smile spread over her face. She stared up at Brother Fuliginous. ""A key,"" she said. ""The answer is, you're a key.""""A wise one,"" acknowledged Brother Fuliginous. ""That's two steps taken. One more to take.""A very old man stepped out of the yellow fog and walked cautiously toward them, his gnarled hand holding onto the stone side of the bridge. He stopped when he reached Brother Fuliginous. His eyes were a glaucous blue-white, thick with cataracts. Richard liked him on sight. ""How many of them are there?"" he asked the younger man, in a deep and reassuring voice.""Three, Father Abbot.""""And has one of them bested the first gatekeeper?""""Yes, Father Abbot.""""And did one of them answer the second gatekeeper correctly?""""Yes, Father Abbot.""There was regret in the old man's voice. ""So, one of them is left to face the Ordeal of the Key. Let him or her stand forward now.""Door said, ""Oh no.""Hunter said, ""Let me take his place. I will face the ordeal.""Brother Fuliginous shook his head. ""We cannot permit that.""When Richard was a small boy he had been taken, as part of a school trip, to a local castle. With his class he had climbed the many steps to the highest point in the castle, a partly ruined tower. They had clustered together at the top, while the teacher pointed out to them the whole of the countryside, spread out below. Even at that age, Richard had not been very good at heights. He had clutched the safety rail, and closed his eyes, and tried not to look down. The teacher had told them that the drop from the top of the old tower to the bottom of the hill it overlooked was three hundred feet; then she told them that a penny, dropped from the top of the tower, would have enough force to penetrate the skull of a man at the bottom of the hill, that it would crack a skull like a bullet. That night Richard lay in bed, unable to sleep for imagining the penny falling with the power of a thunderbolt. Still looking like a penny, but such a murderous penny, when it dropped . . .An ordeal.The penny dropped for Richard. It was a thunderbolt sort of a penny.""Hang on a sec,"" he said. ""Back up. Mm-mm: ordeal. Someone's got an ordeal waiting for them. Somebody who didn't have a little fight down in the mud, and didn't get to answer the riddle . . . "" He was babbling. He could hear himself babbling, and he just didn't care.""This ordeal of yours,"" Richard asked the abbot. ""How much of an ordeal is it?""""This way now,"" said the abbot.""You don't want him,"" said Door. ""Take one of us.""""Three of you come. There are three tests. Each of you faces one test: that is fair,"" said the abbot. ""If he passes the ordeal, he will return to you.""A light breeze eased the fog. The other dark figures were holding crossbows. Each crossbow was pointed at Richard, or Hunter, or Door. The friars closed ranks, cutting Richard off from Hunter and from Door.""We're looking for a key-"" said Richard to the abbot, in a low voice.""Yes,"" said the abbot, placidly.""It's for an angel,"" explained Richard.""Yes,"" said the abbot. He reached out a hand, found the crook of Brother Fuliginous's arm.Richard lowered his voice. ""Look, you can't say no to an angel, especially a man of the cloth like yourself . . . why don't we just skip the ordeal? You could just hand it over.""The abbot began to walk down the curve of the bridge. There was a door, open at the bottom. Richard followed him. Sometimes there is nothing you can do. ""When our order was founded,"" said the abbot, ""we were entrusted with the key. It is one of the holiest, and the most powerful, of all sacred relics. We must pass it on, but only to the one who passes the ordeal and proves worthy.""They walked through winding narrow corridors, Richard leaving a trail of wet mud behind him. ""If I fail the ordeal, then we don't get the key, do we?""""No, my son.""Richard thought about this for a moment. ""Could I come back later for a second try?""Brother Fuliginous coughed. ""Not really, my son,"" said the abbot. ""If that should happen, you will in all probability be . . . "" he paused, and then said, ""beyond caring. But do not fret, perhaps you will be the one to win the key, eh?"" There was a ghastly attempt at reassurance in his voice, more terrifying than any attempt to scare him could have been.""You would kill me?""The abbot stared ahead with blue-milk eyes. There was a touch of reproof in his voice. ""We are holy men,"" he said. ""No, it is the ordeal that kills you.""They walked down a flight of steps, into a low, cryptlike room with oddly decorated walls. ""Now,"" said the abbot. ""Smile!""There was the electric fizz of a camera flash going off, blinding Richard for a moment. When he could see again, Brother Fuliginous was lowering a battered old Polaroid camera and was yanking out the photograph. The friar waited until it had developed, and then he pinned it to the wall. ""This is our wall of those who failed,"" sighed the abbot, ""to ensure that they are none of them forgotten. That is our burden also: memorial.""Richard stared at the faces. A few Polaroids; twenty or thirty other photographic snapshots, some sepia prints and daguerreotypes; and, after that, pencil sketches, and watercolors, and miniatures. They went all the way along one wall. The friars had been at this a very long time.Door shivered. ""I'm so stupid,"" she muttered. ""I should have known. Three of us. I should never have come straight here.""Hunter's head was moving from side to side. She had noted the position of each of the friars and each of the crossbows; she had calculated the odds of getting Door over the side of the bridge first unharmed, then with only minor injuries, and lastly with major injury to herself, but only minor injury to Door. She was now recalculating. ""And what would you have done differently if you had known?"" she asked.""I wouldn't have brought him here, for a start,"" said Door. ""I'd have found the marquis.""Hunter put her head on one side. ""You trust him?"" she asked, directly, and Door knew she was talking of de Carabas, not Richard.""Yes,"" said Door. ""I more or less trust him.""Door had been five years old for just two days. The market was being held in the Gardens at Kew on that day, and her father had taken her with him, as a birthday treat. It was her first market. They were in the butterfly house, surrounded by brightly colored wings, iridescent weightless things that entranced and fascinated her, when her father crouched down beside her. ""Door?"" he said. ""Turn around slowly, and look over there.""She turned, and looked. A dark-skinned man wearing a big coat, his black hair tied behind him in a long pony tail, was standing by the door, talking to two golden-skinned twins, a young man and a young woman. The young woman was crying, in the way that grown-ups cry, keeping it inside as much as they can, and hating it when it still pushes out at the edges, making them ugly and funny-looking on the way. Door turned back to the butterflies. ""You saw him?"" asked her father. She nodded. ""He calls himself the marquis de Carabas,"" he said. ""He's a fraud and a cheat and possibly even something of a monster. If you're ever in trouble, go to him. He will protect you, girl. He has to.""Door looked back at the man. He had a hand on the shoulder of each of the twins and was leading them from the room; but he glanced back over his shoulder, as he left, and he looked straight at her, and smiled an enormous smile; and then he winked at her.The friars who surrounded them were dark ghosts in the fog. Door raised her voice. ""Excuse me, brother,"" she called to Brother Sable. ""But our friend, who's gone to get the key. If he fails, what happens to us?""He took a step toward them, hesitated, and then said, ""We escort you away from here, and we let you go.""""What about Richard?"" she asked. Beneath his cowl, she could see him shaking his head, sadly, finally. ""I should have brought the marquis,"" said Door; and she wondered where he was, and what he was doing.The marquis de Carabas was being crucified on a large X-shaped wooden construction Mr. Vandemar had knocked together from several old pallets, part of a chair and a wooden gate. He had also used most of a large box of rusting nails.It had been a very long time since they had crucified anybody.The marquis de Carabas's arms and legs, were spread into a wide X shape. Rusty nails went into his hands and feet. He was also roped around the waist. After experiencing terrible pain, he was now, more or less, unconscious. The whole construction dangled in the air, from several ropes, in a room that had once been the hospital staff cafeteria. On the ground below, Mr. Croup had assembled a large mound of sharp objects, ranging from razors and kitchen knives to abandoned scalpels and lancets. There was even a poker, from the furnace room.""Why don't you see how he's doing, Mister Vandemar?"" asked Mr. Croup.Mr. Vandemar reached out his hammer, and prodded the marquis experimentally with it.The marquis de Carabas was not a good man, and he knew himself well enough to be perfectly certain that he was not a brave man. He had long since decided that the world, Above or Below, was a place that wished to be deceived, and, to this end, he had named himself from a lie in a fairy tale, and created himself-his clothes, his manner, his carriage-as a grand joke.There was a dull pain at his wrists and his feet, and he was finding it harder and harder to breathe. There was nothing more to be gained by feigning unconsciousness, and he raised his head, as best he could, and spat a gob of scarlet blood into Mr. Valdemar's face.It was a brave thing to do, he thought. And a stupid one. Perhaps they would have let him die quietly, if he had not done that. Now, he had no doubt, they would hurt him more.And perhaps his death would come the quicker for it.The open kettle was boiling fiercely. Richard watched the bubbling water, and the thick steam, and wondered what they were going to do with it. His imagination was able to provide any number of answers, most of which would have been unimaginably painful, none of which turned out to be correct.The boiling water was poured into a pot, to which Brother Fuliginous added three spoons of dried, shredded leaves. The resultant liquid was poured from the pot through a tea strainer, into three china cups. The abbot raised his blind head, sniffed the air, and smiled. ""The first part of the Ordeal of the Key,"" he said, ""is the nice cup of tea. Do you take sugar?""""No, thank you,"" said Richard, warily.Brother Fuliginous added a little milk to the tea, and passed a cup and saucer to Richard. ""Is it poisoned?"" he asked.The abbot looked almost offended: ""Good gracious, no.""Richard sipped the tea, which tasted more or less exactly like tea always tasted. ""But this is part of the ordeal?""Brother Fuliginous took the abbot's hands and placed a cup of tea in them. ""In a manner of speaking,"" said the abbot. ""We always like to give the seekers a cup of tea before they start. Part of the ordeal for us. Not for you."" He sipped his own tea, and a beatific smile spread across his ancient face. ""Rather nice tea, all things considered.""Richard put down his teacup, almost untouched. ""Would you mind,"" he asked, ""if we just began the ordeal?""""Not at all,"" said the abbot. ""Not at all."" He stood up, and the three of them walked toward a door, at the far end of the room.""Is there . . . "" Richard paused, trying to decide what he was trying to ask. Then he said, ""Is there anything you can tell me about the ordeal?""The abbot shook his head. There really was nothing to say: he led the seekers to the door. And then he would wait, for an hour, or two, in the corridor outside. Then he would go back in, and remove the remains of the seeker from the shrine, and inter it in the vaults. And sometimes, which was worse, they would not be dead, although you could not call what was left of them alive, and those unfortunates the Black Friars cared for as best they could.""Right,"" said Richard. And he smiled, unconvincingly, and added, ""Well, lead on, Macduff.""Brother Fuliginous pulled back the bolts on the door. They opened with a crash, like twin gunshots. He pulled the door open. Richard stepped through it. Brother Fuliginous pushed the door closed behind him, and swung the bolts back into place. He led the abbot back to his chair and placed the cup of tea back in the old man's hand. The abbot sipped his tea, in silence. And then he said, with honest regret in his voice, ""It's 'lay on, Macduff' actually. But I hadn't the heart to correct him. He sounded like such a nice young man.""
NW_ch12	NW	Neverwhere	12	3505	19804	NeverwhereTWELVERichard Mayhew walked down the underground platform. It was a District Line station: the sign said BLACKFRIARS. The platform was empty. Somewhere in the distance an Underground train roared and rattled, driving a ghost-wind along the platform, which scattered a copy of the tabloid Sun into its component pages, four-color breasts and black-and-white invective scurrying and tumbling off the platform and down onto the rails.Richard walked the length of the platform. Then he sat down on a bench and waited for something to happen.Nothing happened.He rubbed his head and felt slightly sick. There were footsteps on the platform, near him, and he looked up to see a prim little girl walking past him, hand in hand with a woman who looked like a larger, older version of the girl. They glanced at him and then, rather obviously, looked away. ""Don't get too near to him, Melanie,"" advised the woman, in a very audible whisper.Melanie looked at Richard, staring in the way children stare, without embarrassment or self consciousness. Then she looked back at her mother. ""Why do people like that stay alive?"" she asked, curiously.""Not enough guts to end it all,"" explained her mother.Melanie risked another glance at Richard. ""Pathetic,"" she said. Their feet pattered away down the platform, and soon they were gone. He wondered if he had imagined it. He tried to remember why he was standing on this platform. Was he waiting for a Tube train? Where was he going? He knew the answer was somewhere in his head, somewhere close at hand, but he could not touch it, could not bring it back from the lost places. He sat there, alone and wondering. Was he dreaming? With his hands he felt the hard red plastic seat beneath him, stamped the platform with mud-encrusted shoes (where had the mud come from?), touched his face . . . No. This was no dream. Wherever he was, was real. He felt odd: detached, and depressed, and horribly, strangely saddened. Someone sat down next to him. Richard did not look up, did not turn his head.""Hello,"" said a familiar voice. ""How are you, Dick? You all right?""Richard looked up. He felt his face creasing into a smile, hope hitting him like a blow to the chest.""Gary?"" he asked, scared. Then, ""You can see me?""Gary grinned. ""You always were a kidder,"" he said. ""Funny man, funny.""Gary was wearing a suit and tie. He was cleanshaven, and had not a hair out of place. Richard realized what he must look like: muddy, unshaven, rumpled . . . ""Gary? I . . . listen, I know what I must look like. I can explain."" He thought for a moment. ""No . . . I can't. Not really.""""It's okay,"" said Gary reassuringly. His voice was soothing, sane. ""Not sure how to tell you this. Bit awkward."" He paused. ""Look,"" he explained. ""I'm not really here.""""Yes, you are,"" said Richard. Gary shook his head, sympathetically. ""No,"" he said. ""I'm not. I'm you. Talking to yourself.""Richard wondered vaguely if this was one of Gary's jokes. ""Maybe this will help,"" said Gary. He raised his hands to his face, pushed at it, molded, shaped. His face oozed like warm Silly Putty.""Is that better?"" said the person who had been Gary, in a voice that was jarringly familiar. Richard knew the new face: he had shaved it most weekday mornings since he had left school; he had brushed its teeth, combed its hair, and, on occasion, wished it looked more like Tom Cruise's, or John Lennon's, or anyone else's, really. It was, of course, his face. ""You're sitting on Blackfriars Station at rush hour,"" said the other Richard, casually. ""You're talking to yourself. And you know what they say about people who talk to themselves. It's just that you're starting to edge a little closer to sanity, now.""The damp, muddy Richard stared into the face of the clean, well-dressed Richard, and he said, ""I don't know who you are or what you're trying to do. But you aren't even very convincing: you don't really look like me."" He was lying, and he knew it.His other self smiled encouragingly, and shook his head. ""I'm you, Richard,"" he said. ""I'm whatever's left of your sanity . . . ""It was not the embarrassing echo of his voice he heard on answering machines, on tapes and home videos, that horrid parody of a voice that passed for his: the man spoke with Richard's true voice, the voice he heard in his head when he spoke, resonant and real.""Concentrate!"" shouted the man with Richard's face. ""Look at this place, try to see the people, try to see the truth . . . you're already the closest to reality that you've been in a week . . . """"This is bullshit,"" said Richard, flatly, desperately. He shook his head, denying everything his other self was saying, but, still, he looked at the platform, wondering what it was he was meant to be seeing. Then something flickered, at the corner of his vision; he followed it with his head, but it was gone.""Look,"" whispered his double. ""See.""""See what?"" He was standing on an empty, dimly lit station platform, a lonely mausoleum of a place. And then . . .The noise and the light struck him like a bottle across the face: he was standing on Blackfriars Station, in the middle of the rush hour. People bustled by him: a riot of noise and light, of shoving, moving humanity. There was an Underground train waiting at the platform, and, reflected in its window, Richard could see himself. He looked crazy; he had a week's growth of beard; food was crusted around his mouth; one eye had recently been blackened, and a boil, an angry red carbuncle, was coming up on the side of his nose; he was filthy, covered in a black, encrusted dirt which filled his pores and lived under his fingernails; his eyes were red and bleary, his hair was matted and snarled. He was a crazy homeless person, standing on a platform of a busy Underground station, in the heart of the rush hour. Richard buried his face deep in his hands. When he raised his face, the other people were gone. The platform was dark again, and he was alone. He sat down on a bench and closed his eyes. A hand found his hand, held it for some moments, and then squeezed it. A woman's hand: he could smell a familiar perfume.The other Richard sat on his left, and now Jessica sat on his right, holding his hand in hers, looking at him compassionately. He had never seen that expression on her face before.""Jess?"" he said.Jessica shook her head. She let go of his hand. ""I'm afraid not,"" she said. ""I'm still you. But you have to listen, darling. You're the closest to reality you've been-""""You people keep saying, the closest to reality, the closest to sanity, I don't know what you . . . "" He paused. Something came back to him, then. He looked at the other version of himself, at the woman he had loved. ""Is this part of the ordeal?"" he demanded.""Ordeal?"" asked Jessica. She exchanged a concerned glance with the-other-Richard-who-wasn't-him.""Yes. Ordeal. With the Black Friars who live under London,"" Richard said. As he said it, it became more real, ""There's a key I have to get for this angel called Islington. If I get him the key, he'll send me home again . . . "" His mouth dried up, and he could talk no longer.""Listen to yourself,"" said the other Richard, gently. ""Can't you tell how ridiculous all this sounds?"" Jessica looked as if she were trying not to cry. Her eyes glistened. ""You're not going through an ordeal, Richard. You-you had some kind of nervous breakdown. A couple of weeks ago. I think you just cracked up. I broke off our engagement-you'd been acting so strangely, it was like you were a different person, I-I couldn't cope . . . Then you vanished . . . "" The tears began to run down her cheeks, and she stopped talking to blow her nose on a tissue.The other Richard began to speak. ""I wandered, alone and crazy, through the streets of London, sleeping under bridges, eating food from garbage cans. Shivering and lost and alone. Muttering to myself, talking to people who weren't there . . . """"I'm so sorry, Richard,"" said Jessica. She was crying, now, her face contorted and unattractive. Her mascara was beginning to run, and her nose was red. He had never seen her hurting before, and he realized how much he wanted to take her pain away. Richard reached out for her, to try to hold her, to comfort and reassure her, but the world slid and twisted and changed . . .Someone stumbled into him, cursed and walked away. Richard was lying prone on the platform, in the rush-hour glare. The side of his face was sticky and cold. He pulled his head up off the ground. He had been lying in a pool of his own vomit. At least, he hoped it was his own. Passersby stared at him with revulsion, or, after one flick of the eyes, did not look at him again.He wiped at his face with his hands and tried to get up, but he could no longer remember how. Richard began to whimper. He shut his eyes tightly, and he kept them shut. When he opened them, thirty seconds, or an hour, or a day later, the platform was in semidarkness. He climbed to his feet. There was nobody there. ""Hello?"" he called. ""Help me. Please.""Gary was sitting on the bench, watching him. ""What, you still need someone to tell you what to do?"" Gary got up and walked over to where Richard was standing. ""Richard,"" he said, urgently. ""I'm you. The only advice I can give you is what you're telling yourself. Only, maybe you're too scared to listen.""""You aren't me,"" said Richard, but he no longer believed it.""Touch me,"" said Gary.Richard reached a hand out: his hand pushed into Gary's face, squashing and distorting it, as if it were pushing into warm bubble gum. Richard felt nothing in the air around his hand. He pulled his fingers out of Gary's face.""See?"" said Gary. ""I'm not here. All there is, is you, walking up and down the platform, talking to yourself, trying to get up the courage to . . . ""Richard had not meant to say anything; but his mouth moved and he heard his voice saying, ""Trying to get up the courage to do what?""A deep voice came over the loudspeaker, and echoed, distorted, down the platform. ""London Transport would like to apologize for the delay. This is due to an incident at Blackfriars Station."" ""To do that,"" said Gary, inclining his head. ""Become an incident at Blackfriars Station. To end it all. Your life's a joyless, loveless, empty sham. You've got no friends-""""I've got you,"" whispered Richard. Gary appraised Richard with frank eyes.""I think you're an asshole,"" he said, honestly. ""A complete joke.""""I've got Door, and Hunter, and Anaesthesia.""Gary smiled. There was real pity in the smile, and it hurt Richard more than hatred or enmity could ever have done. ""More imaginary 'friends? We all used to laugh at you round the office for those trolls. Remember them? On your desk."" He laughed. Richard started to laugh, too. It was all too horrible: there was nothing else to do but laugh. After some time he stopped laughing. Gary put his hand into his pocket and produced a small plastic troll. It had frizzy purple hair, and it had once sat on the top of Richard's computer screen. ""Here,"" said Gary. He tossed the troll to Richard. Richard tried to catch it; he reached out his hands, but it fell through them as if they were not there. He went down onto his hands and knees on the empty platform, fumbling for the troll. It seemed to him, then, as if it were the only fragment he had of his real life: that if he could only get the troll back, perhaps he could get everything back . . .Flash.It was rush hour again. A train disgorged hundreds of people onto the platform, and hundreds of others tried to get on, and Richard was down on his hands and knees, being kicked and buffeted by the commuters. Somebody stepped on his fingers, hard. He screamed shrilly, and stuck his fingers into his mouth, instinctively, like a burned child; they tasted disgusting. He did not care: he could see the troll at the platform's edge, now only ten feet away, and he crawled, slowly, on all fours, through the crowd, across the platform. People swore at him; they got in his way; they buffeted him. He had never imagined that ten feet could be such a long distance to travel.Richard heard a high-pitched voice giggling, as he crawled, and he wondered who it could belong to. It was a disturbing giggle, nasty and strange. He wondered what manner of crazy person could giggle like that. He swallowed, and the giggling stopped, and then he knew.He was almost at the edge of the platform. An elderly woman stepped onto the train, and as she did so, her foot knocked the purple-haired troll down into the darkness, down into the gap between the train and the platform. ""No,"" said Richard. He was still laughing, an awkward, wheezing laugh, but tears stung his eyes and spilled down his cheeks. He rubbed his eyes with his hands, making them sting even more.Flash.The platform was deserted and dark again. He climbed to his feet and walked, unsteadily, the last few feet, to the edge of the platform. He could see it there, down on the tracks, by the third rail: a small splash of purple, his troll. He looked ahead of him: there were enormous posters stuck to the wall on the other side of the tracks. The posters advertised credit cards and sports shoes and holidays in Cyprus. As he looked the words on the posters twisted and mutated.New messages:END IT ALL was one of them.PUT YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR MISERY.BE A MAN-DO YOURSELF IN.HAVE A FATAL ACCIDENT TODAY.He nodded. He was talking to himself. The posters did not really say that. Yes, he was talking to himself; and it was time that he listened. He could hear the rattling of a train, not far away, coming toward the station. Richard clenched his teeth, and swayed back and forth, as if he were still being buffeted by commuters, although he was alone on the platform.The train was coming toward him; its headlights shining out from the tunnel like the eyes of a monstrous dragon in a childhood nightmare. And he understood then just how little effort it would take to make the pain stop-to take all the pain he ever had had, all the pain he ever would have, and make it all go away for ever and ever. He pushed his hands deep into his pockets, and took a deep breath. It would be so easy. A moment of pain, and then it would all be over and done . . .There was something in his pocket. He felt it with his fingers: something smooth and hard and roughly spherical. He pulled it out of his pocket, and examined it: a quartz bead. He remembered picking it up, then. He had been on the far side of Night's Bridge. The bead had been part of Anaesthesia's necklace.And from somewhere, in his head or out of it, he thought he heard the rat-girl say, ""Richard. Hold on."" He did not know if there was anyone helping him at that moment. He suspected that he was, truly, talking to himself. That this was the real him speaking, and he was, finally, listening.He nodded and put the bead back into his pocket. And he stood on the platform and waited for the train to come in. It arrived at the platform, slowed, came to a full stop.The train doors hissed open. The carriage was filled with every manner and kind of people, all of whom were, unmistakably, quite dead. There were fresh corpses, with ragged cuts in their throats or bullet holes in their temples. There were old, desiccated bodies. There were strap-hanging cadavers, covered with cobwebs, and cancerous things lolling in their seats. Each corpse seemed, as much as one could tell, to have died by its own hand. Some were male, and some were female. Richard thought he had seen some of those faces, pinned to a long wall; but he could no longer remember where he had seen them, could not remember when. The carriage smelled like a morgue might at the end of a long, hot summer during the course of which the refrigeration equipment had failed for good.Richard had no idea who he was, anymore; no idea what was or what was not true; nor whether he was brave or cowardly, mad or sane, but he knew the next thing he had to do. He stepped onto the train, and all the lights went out.The bolts were drawn back. Two loud bangs echoed through the room. The door to the tiny shrine was pushed open, letting in lamplight from the hall outside.It was a small room with a high arched ceiling. A silver key hung from a thread, attached to the highest point of the ceiling. The wind caused by the opening of the door made the key swing back and forth, and then spin slowly, first one way, and then the other. The abbot held Brother Fuliginous's arm, and the two men walked into the shrine, side by side. Then the abbot let go of the brother's arm, and said, ""Take the body, Brother Fuliginous.""""But. But Father . . . """"What is it?""Brother Fuliginous went down on one knee. The abbot could hear fingers against cloth and skin. ""He's not dead.""The abbot sighed. It was an evil thing to think, he knew, but he honestly felt it was so much kinder if they died outright. This was so much worse. ""One of those, eh?"" he said. ""Ah well, we will look after the poor creature until it passes on to its ultimate reward. Lead it to the infirmary.""And a weak voice said, quietly, but firmly, ""I am not a poor creature."" The abbot heard someone stand up; heard Brother Fuliginous's sharp intake of breath. ""I . . . I think I got through it,"" said Richard Mayhew's voice, suddenly uncertain. ""Unless this is more of the ordeal.""""No, my son,"" said the abbot. There was something in his voice that might have been awe, and might have been regret.There was silence. ""I . . . I think I will have that cup of tea now, if you don't mind,"" said Richard.""Of course,"" said the abbot. ""This way."" Richard stared at the old man. The glaucous eyes gazed out at nothing at all. He seemed pleased that Richard was alive, but . . .""Excuse me?"" said Brother Fuliginous, respectfully, to Richard, breaking his train of thought. ""Don't forget your key.""""Oh. Yes. Thanks."" He had forgotten about the key. He reached out and closed his hand upon the cold silver key, rotating slowly on its thread. He tugged, and the thread snapped easily.Richard opened his hand, and the key stared up at him from his palm. ""By my crooked teeth,"" asked Richard, remembering, ""who am I?""He put it into his pocket, next to the small quartz bead, and together they left that place.The fog had begun to thin. Hunter was pleased. She was confident now that, should it become necessary, she could get the Lady Door away from the friars entirely unharmed and get herself away with only minor flesh wounds.There was a flurry of movement on the far side of the bridge. ""Something's happening,"" said Hunter to Door, under her breath. ""Get ready to make a run for it.""The friars drew back. Richard Mayhew, the Upworlder, came toward them through the fog, walking beside the abbot. Richard looked different, somehow . . . Hunter scrutinized him, trying to work out what had changed. His center of balance had moved lower, become more centered. No . . . it was more than that. He looked less boyish. He looked as if he had begun to grow up.""Still alive then?"" said Hunter. He nodded; put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a silver key. He tossed it to Door, who caught it, then flung herself at him, wrapping her arms around him, squeezing him as tightly as she could.Then Door let go of Richard and ran to the abbot. ""I can't tell you how much this means to us,"" she said to him.He smiled, weakly but graciously. ""May the Temple and the Arch be with you all, on your journey through the Underside,"" he said.Door curtseyed, and then, clutching the key tightly in her hand, she went back to Richard, and to Hunter. The three travelers walked down the bridge, and away. The friars stood on the bridge until they were out of sight, lost in the old fog of the world beneath the world.""We have lost the key,"" said the abbot to himself, as much as to any of them. ""God help us all.""
NW_ch13	NW	Neverwhere	13	3742	21747	NeverwhereTHIRTEENThe Angel Islington was dreaming A dark and rushing dream.Huge waves were rising and crashing over the city; the night sky was rent with forks of white lightning from horizon to horizon; the rain fell in sheets, the city trembled; fires started near the great amphitheater and spread, quickly, through the city, defying the storm. Islington was looking down on everything from far above, hovering in the air, as one hovers in dreams, as it had hovered in those long-ago times. There were buildings in that city that were many hundreds of feet high, but they were dwarfed by the gray-green Atlantic waves. And then it heard the people scream. There were four million people in Atlantis, and, in its dream, Islington heard each and every one of their voices, clearly and distinctly, as, one by one, they screamed, and choked, and burned, and drowned, and died. The waves swallowed the city, and, at length, the storm subsided.When dawn broke, there was nothing to indicate there had ever been a city there at all, let alone an island twice the size of Greece. Nothing of Atlantis remained but the water-bloated bodies of children, of women and of men, floating on the cold morning waves; bodies the seagulls, gray and white, were already beginning to pick with their cruel beaks.And Islington woke. It was standing in the octagon of iron pillars, beside the great black door, made of flint and tarnished silver. It touched the cold smoothness of the flint, the chill of the metal. It touched the table. It ran its finger lightly along the walls. Then it walked through chambers of its hall, one after another, touching things, as if to reassure itself of their existence, to convince itself it was here, and now. It followed patterns, as it walked, smooth channels its bare feet had worn, over the centuries, in the rock. It stopped when it reached the rock-pool, kneeling down and letting its fingers touch the cold water.There was a ripple in the water, which began with its fingertips and echoed out to the edges. The reflections in the pool, of the angel itself and the candle flames that framed it, shimmered and transformed. It was looking into a cellar. The angel concentrated for a moment; it could hear a telephone ring, somewhere in the distance.Mr. Croup walked over to the telephone and picked up the receiver. He looked rather pleased with himself. ""Croup and Vandemar,"" he barked. ""Eyes gouged, noses twisted, tongues pierced, chins cleft, throats slit.""""Mister Croup,"" said the angel. ""They now have the key. I want the girl called Door kept safe on her journey back to me.""""Safe,"" repeated Mr. Croup, unimpressed. ""Right. We'll keep her safe. What a marvelous idea-such originality. Positively astounding. Most people would be content with hiring assassins for executions, sly killings, vile murders even. Only you, sir, would hire the two finest cutthroats in the whole of space and time, and then ask them to ensure a little girl remains unharmed.""""See that she is, Mister Croup. Nothing is to hurt her. Permit her to be harmed in any way and you will displease me deeply. Do you understand?""""Yes."" Croup shifted uncomfortably.""Is there anything else?"" asked Islington.""Yes, sir."" Croup coughed into his hand. ""Do you remember the marquis de Carabas?""""Of course.""""I take it that there is no such similar prohibition on extirpating the marquis . . . ?""""Not any longer,"" said the angel. ""Just protect the girl.""It removed its hand from the water. The reflection was now merely candle flames and an angel of astonishing, perfectly androgynous, beauty. The Angel Islington stood up and returned to its inner chambers to await its eventual visitors.""What did he say?"" asked Mr. Vandemar.""He said, Mister Vandemar, that we should feel free to do whatsoever we wished to the marquis.""Vandemar nodded. ""Did that include killing him painfully?"" he asked, a little pedantically.""Yes, Mister Vandemar, I would say, on reflection, it did.""""That's good, Mister Croup. Wouldn't like another telling-off."" He looked up at the bloody thing hanging above them. ""Better get rid of the body, then.""One of the front wheels on the supermarket shopping cart squeaked, and it had a pronounced tendency to pull to the left. Mr. Vandemar had found the metal cart on a grassed-in traffic island, near the hospital. It was, he had realized on seeing it, just the right size for moving a body. He could have carried the body, of course; but then it could have bled on him, or dripped other fluids. And he only had the one suit. So he pushed the shopping cart with the body of the marquis de Carabas in it through the storm drain, and the cart went squee, squee and pulled to the left. He wished that Mr. Croup would push the shopping cart, for a change. But Mr. Croup was talking. ""You know, Mister Vandemar,"" he was saying, ""I am currently too overjoyed, too delighted, not to mention too utterly and illimitably ecstatic, to grouse, gripe or grumble-having finally been permitted to do what we do best-'""Mr. Vandemar negotiated a particularly awkward corner. ""Kill someone, you mean?"" he asked.Mr. Croup beamed. ""Kill someone I mean indeed, Mister Vandemar, brave soul, glittering, noble fellow. However, by now you must have sensed a lurking 'but' skulking beneath my happy, blithe, and chipper exterior. A minuscule vexation, like the teeniest lump of raw liver sticking to the inside of my boot. You must, I have no doubt, be saying to yourself, 'All is not well in Mister Croup's breast. I shall induce him to unburden himself to me.' ""Mr. Vandemar pondered this while he forced open the round iron door between the storm drain and the sewer and clambered through. Then he manhandled the wire cart with the marquis de Carabas's body through the doorway. And then, more or less certain that he had been thinking nothing of the sort, he said, ""No.""Mr. Croup ignored this, and continued, "" . . . And, were I then, in response to your pleadings, to divulge to you what vexes me, I would confess that my soul is irked by the necessity to hide our light under a bushel. We should be hanging the former marquis's sad remains from the highest gibbet in London Below. Not tossing it away, like a used . . . "" He paused, searching for the exact simile.""Rat?"" suggested Mr. Vandemar. ""Thumbscrew? Spleen?"" Squee, squee went the wheels of the shopping cart.""Ah well,"" said Mr. Croup. In front of them was a deep channel of brown water. Drifting on the water's surface were off-white suds of foam, used condoms, and occasional fragments of toilet paper. Mr. Vandemar stopped the shopping cart. Mr. Croup leaned down and picked up the marquis's head by the hair, hissing into its dead ear, ""The sooner this business is over and done with, the happier I'll be. There's other times and other places that would properly appreciate two pair of dab hands with the garrotting wire and the boning knife.""Then he stood up. ""Goodnight, good marquis. Don't forget to write.""Mr. Vandemar tipped over the cart, and the marquis's corpse tumbled out and splashed into the brown water below them. And then, because he had come to dislike it intensely, Mr. Vandemar pushed the shopping cart into the sewer as well, and watched the current carry it away.Then Mr. Croup held his lamp up high, and he stared out at the place in which they stood. ""It is saddening to reflect,"" said Mr. Croup, ""that there are folk walking the streets above who will never know the beauty of these sewers, Mister Vandemar. These red-brick cathedrals beneath their feet.""""Craftsmanship,"" agreed Mr. Vandemar.They turned their backs on the brown water and made their way back into the tunnels. ""With cities, as with people, Mister Vandemar,"" said Mr. Croup, fastidiously, ""the condition of the bowels is all-important.""Door tied the key around her neck with a piece of string that she found in one of the pockets of her leather jacket. ""That's not going to be safe,"" said Richard. The girl made a face at him. ""Well,"" he said. ""It's not.""She shrugged. ""Okay,"" she said. ""I'll get a chain for it when we get to the market."" They were walking through a maze of caves, deep tunnels hacked from the limestone that seemed almost prehistoric.Richard chuckled. ""What's so funny?"" Door asked.He grinned. ""I was just thinking of the expression on the marquis's face when we tell him we got the key from the friars without his help.""""I'm sure he'll have something sardonic to say about it,"" she said. ""And then, back to the angel. By the 'long and dangerous way.' Whatever that is.""Richard admired the paintings on the cave walls. Russets and ochres and siennas outlined charging boars and fleeing gazelles, woolly mastodons and giant sloths: he imagined that the paintings had to be thousands of years old, but then they turned a corner, and he noticed that, in the same style, there were lorries, house cats, cars, and-markedly inferior to the other images, as if only glimpsed infrequently, and from a long way away-airplanes.None of the paintings were very high off the ground. He wondered if the painters were a race of subterranean Neanderthal pygmies. It was as likely as anything else in this strange world. ""So where is the next market?"" he asked.""No idea,"" said Door. ""Hunter?""Hunter slipped out of the shadows. ""I don't know.""A small figure dashed past them, going back the way they had come. A few moments later another couple of tiny figures came toward them in fell pursuit. Hunter whipped out a hand as they passed, snagging a small boy by the ear. ""Ow,"" he said, in the manner of small boys. ""Let me go! She stole my paintbrush.""""That's right,"" said a piping voice from further down the corridor. ""She did.""""I didn't,"" came an even higher and more piping voice, from even further down the corridor.Hunter pointed to the paintings on the cave wall. ""You did these?"" she asked.The boy had the towering arrogance only seen in the greatest of artists and all nine-year-old boys. ""Yeah,"" he said, truculently. ""Some of them.""""Not bad,"" said Hunter. The boy glared at her.""Where's the next Floating Market?"" asked Door.""Belfast,"" said the boy. ""Tonight.""""Thanks,"" said Door. ""Hope you get your paintbrush back. Let him go, Hunter.""Hunter let go of the boy's ear. He did not move. He looked her up and down, then made a face, to indicate that he was, without any question at all, unimpressed. ""You're Hunter?"" he asked. She smiled down at him, modestly. He sniffed. ""You're the best bodyguard in the Underside?""""So they tell me.""The boy reached one hand back and forward again, in one smooth movement. He stopped, puzzled, and opened his hand, examined his palm. Then he looked up at Hunter, confused. Hunter opened her hand to reveal a small switchblade with a wicked edge. She held it up, out of the boy's reach. He wrinkled his nose. ""How'd you do that?""""Scram,"" said Hunter. She closed the knife and tossed it back to the boy, who took off down the corridor without a backward glance, in pursuit of his paintbrush.The body of the marquis de Carabas drifted east, through the deep sewer, face down.London's sewers had begun their lives as rivers and streams, flowing north to south (and, south of the Thames, south to north) carrying garbage, animal carcasses, and the contents of chamber pots into the Thames, which would, for the most part, carry the offending substances out to sea. This system had more or less worked for many years, until, in 1858, the enormous volume of effluent produced by the people and industries of London, combined with a rather hot summer, produced a phenomenon known at the time as the Great Stink: the Thames itself had become an open sewer. People who could leave London, left it; the ones who stayed wrapped cloths doused in carbolic around their faces and tried not to breathe through their noses. Parliament was forced to recess early in 1858, and the following year it ordered that a programme of sewer-building begin. The thousands of miles of sewers that were built were constructed with a gentle slope from the west to the east, and, somewhere beyond Greenwich, they were pumped into the Thames Estuary, and the sewage was swept off into the North Sea. It was this journey that the body of the late marquis de Carabas was making, traveling west to east, toward the sunrise and the sewage works.Rats on a high brick ledge, doing the things that rats do when no people are watching, saw the body go by. The largest of them, a big black male, chittered. A smaller brown female chittered back, then she leapt down from the ledge onto the marquis's back and rode it down the sewer a little way, sniffing at the hair and the coat, tasting the blood, and then, precariously, leaning over, and scrutinizing what could be seen of the face.She hopped off the head into the filthy water and swam industriously to the side, where she clambered up the slippery brickwork. She hurried back a long a beam, and rejoined her companions.""Belfast?"" asked Richard.Door smiled, impishly, and would say nothing more than, ""You'll see,"" when he pressed her about it.He changed his tack. ""How do you know that kid was telling you the truth about the market?"" he asked.""It's not something anyone down here ever lies about. I . . . don't think we can lie about it."" She paused. ""The market's special.""""How did that kid know where it was?""""Someone told him,"" said Hunter.Richard brooded on this for a moment. ""How did they know?""""Someone told them,"" explained Door.""But . . . "" He wondered who chose the locations in the first place, how the knowledge was spread, trying to frame the question in such a way that he did not sound stupid.A rich female voice asked from the darkness, ""Hss. Any idea when the next market is?""She stepped into the light. She wore silver jewelry, and her dark hair was perfectly coifed. She was very pale, and her long dress was jet black velvet. Richard knew immediately that he had seen her before, but it took him a few moments to place her: the first Floating Market, that was it-in Harrods. She had smiled at him.""Tonight,"" said Hunter. ""Belfast.""""Thank you,"" said the woman. She had the most amazing eyes, thought Richard. They were the color of foxgloves.""I'll see you there,"" she said, and she looked at Richard as she said it. Then she looked away, a little shyly; she stepped into the shadows, and she was gone.""Who was that?"" asked Richard.""They call themselves Velvets,"" said Door. ""They sleep down here during the day, and walk the Up-world at night.""""Are they dangerous?"" asked Richard.""Everybody's dangerous,"" said Hunter.""Look,"" said Richard. ""Going back to the market. Who decides where it gets held, and when? And how do the first people find out where it's being held?"" Hunter shrugged. ""Door?"" he asked.""I've never thought about it."" They turned a corner. Door held up her lamp. ""Not bad at all,"" said Door.""And fast, too,"" said Hunter. She touched the painting on the rock wall with her fingertip. The paint was still wet. It was a painting of Hunter and Door and Richard. It was not flattering.The black rat entered the lair of the Golden deferentially, his head lowered, ears back. He crawled forward, squeeing and chittering.The Golden had made their lair in a pile of bones. This pile of bones had once belonged to a woolly mammoth, back in the cold times when the great hairy beasts walked across the snowy tundra of the south of England as if, in the opinion of the Golden, they owned the place. This particular mammoth, at least, had been disabused of that idea rather thoroughly and quite terminally by the Golden.The black rat made its obeisance at the base of the bone pile. Then he lay on his back with his throat exposed, closed his eyes, and waited. After a while a chittering from above told him that he could roll over.One of the Golden crawled out of the mammoth skull, on top of the heap of bones. It crawled along the old ivory tusk, a golden-furred rat with copper-colored eyes, the size of a large house cat.The black rat spoke. The Golden thought, briefly, and chattered an order. The black rat rolled on his back, exposing his throat again, for a moment. Then a twist and a wriggle, and he was on his way.There had been Sewer Folk before the Great Stink, of course, living in the Elizabethan sewers, or the Restoration sewers, or the Regency sewers, as more and more of London's waterways were forced into pipes and covered passages, as the expanding population produced more filth, more rubbish, more effluent; but after the Great Stink, after the great plan of Victorian sewer-building, that was when the Sewer Folk came into their own. They could be found anywhere in the length and breadth of the sewers, but they made their permanent homes in some of the churchlike red-brick vaults toward the east, at the confluence of many of the churning foamy waters. There they would sit, rods and nets and improvised hooks beside them, and watch the surface of the brown water.They wore clothes-brown and green clothes, covered in a thick layer of something that might have been mold and might have been a petrochemical ooze, and might, conceivably, have been something much worse. They wore their hair long and matted. They smelled more or less as one would imagine. Old storm lanterns were hung about the tunnel. Nobody knew what the Sewer Folk used for fuel, but their lanterns burned with a rather noxious blue-and-green flame.It was not known how the Sewer Folk communicated among themselves. In their few dealings with the outside world, they used a kind of sign language. They lived in a world of gurgles and drips, the men, the women, and the silent little sewer children.Dunnikin spotted something in the water. He was the chief of the Sewer Folk, the wisest and the oldest. He knew the sewers better than their original builders did. Dunnikin reached for a long shrimping net; one practiced hand movement and he was fishing out a rather bedraggled mobile telephone from the water. He walked over to a small heap of rubbish in the corner and put the telephone down with the rest of their haul. The day's catch so far consisted of two odd gloves, a shoe, a cat skull, a sodden packet of cigarettes, an artificial leg, a dead cocker spaniel, a pair of antlers (mounted), and the bottom half of a baby carriage.It had not been a good day. And tonight was a market night, in the open air. So Dunnikin kept his eyes on the water. You never knew what would turn up.Old Bailey was hanging his wash out to dry. Blankets and sheets fluttered and blew in the wind on the top of Centre Point, the ugly and distinctive sixties skyscraper that marks the eastern end of Oxford Street, far above Tottenham Court Road Station. Old Bailey did not care very much for Centre Point itself, but, as he'd often tell the birds, the view from the top was without compare, and, furthermore, the top of Centre Point was one of the few places in the West End of London where you did not have to look at Centre Point itself.The wind ripped feathers from Old Bailey's coat and blew them away, off over London. He did not mind. As he also often told his birds, there were more where those came from.A large black rat crawled out through a ripped air-vent cover, looked around, then came over to Old Bailey's bird-spattered tent. It ran up the side of the tent, then along the top of Old Bailey's washing line. It squealed at him, urgently.""Slower, slower,"" said Old Bailey. The rat repeated itself, at a lower pitch, but just as urgently. ""Bless me,"" said Old Bailey. He ran into his tent and returned with weapons-his toasting fork and a coal shovel. Then he hurried back into the tent again and came out with some bargaining tools. And then he walked back into the tent for the last time, and opened his wooden chest, and pocketed the silver box. ""I really don't have time for this tomfoolery,"" he told the rat, on his final exit from the tent. ""I'm a very busy man. Birds don't catch themselves, y'know.""The rat squeaked at him. Old Bailey was unfastening the coil of rope around his middle. ""Well,"" he told the rat, ""there's others could get the body. I'm not as young as I was. I don't like the under-places. I'm a roof-man, I am, born and bred.""The rat made a rude noise.""More haste, less speed,"" replied Old Bailey. ""I'm goin'. Young whippersnapper. I knew your great-great-grandfather, young feller-me-rat, so don't you try putting on airs . . . Now, where's the market going to be?"" The rat told him. Then Old Bailey put the rat in his pocket and climbed over the side of the building.Sitting on the ledge beside the sewer, in his plastic lawn chair, Dunnikin was overcome by a presentiment of wealth and prosperity. He could feel it drifting from west to east, toward them.He clapped his hands, loudly. Other men ran to him, and the women, and the children, seizing hooks and nets and lines as they did so. They assembled along the slippery sewer ledge, in the sputtering green light of their lanterns. Dunnikin pointed, and they waited, in silence, which is how the Sewer Folk wait.The body of the marquis de Carabas came floating facedown along the sewer, the current carrying him as slow and stately as a funeral barge. They pulled it in with their hooks and their nets, in silence, and soon had it up on the ledge. They removed the coat, the boots, the gold pocket-watch, and the contents of the coat pockets, although they left the rest of the clothes on the corpse.Dunnikin beamed at the loot. He clapped again, and the Sewer Folk began to ready themselves for the market. Now they truly had something of value to sell.""Are you sure the marquis will be at the market?"" Richard asked Door, as the path began, slowly, to climb.""He won't let us down,"" she said, as confidently as she could. ""I'm sure he'll be there.""
NW_ch14	NW	Neverwhere	14	4093	23340	NeverwhereFOURTEENHMS Belfast is a gunship of 11,000 tons, commissioned in 1939, which saw active service in the Second World War. Since then it has been moored on the south bank of the Thames, in postcard-land, between Tower Bridge and London Bridge, opposite the Tower of London. From its deck one can see St. Paul's Cathedral and the gilt top of the columnlike Monument to the Great Fire of London erected, as so much of London was erected, by Christopher Wren. The ship serves as a floating museum, as a memorial, as a training ground.There is a walkway onto the ship from the shore, and they came down the walkway in their twos and threes, and in their dozens. They set up their stalls as early as they could, all the tribes of London Below, united both by the Market Truce and by a mutual desire to pitch their own stalls as far as possible from the Sewer Folk's stall.It had been agreed well over a century before that the Sewer Folk could only set up a stall at those markets held in the open air. Dunnikin and his folk dumped their booty in a large pile on a rubber sheet, beneath a large gun tower. Nobody ever came to the Sewer Folk's stall immediately: but toward the end of the market they would come, the bargain hunters, the curious, and those few fortunate individuals blessed with no sense of smell.Richard and Hunter and Door pushed their way through the crowds on the deck. Richard realized that he had somehow lost the need to stop and stare. The people here were no less strange than at the last Floating Market, but, he supposed, he was every bit as strange to them, wasn't he? He looked around, scanning the faces in the crowd as they walked, hunting for the marquis's ironic smile. ""I don't see him,"" he said.They were approaching a smith's stall, where a man who could easily have passed for a small mountain, if one were to overlook the shaggy brown beard, tossed a lump of red-molten metal from a brazier onto an anvil. Richard had never seen a real anvil before. He could feel the heat from the molten metal and the brazier from a dozen feet away.""Keep looking. De Carabas'll turn up,"" said Door, looking behind them. ""Like a bad penny."" She thought for a moment, and added, ""What exactly is a bad penny anyway?"" And then, before Richard could answer, she squealed, ""Hammersmith!""The bearded mountain-man looked up, stopped hitting the molten metal, and roared, ""By the Temple and the Arch. Lady Door!"" Then he picked her up, as if she weighed no more than a mouse.""Hello, Hammersmith,"" said Door. ""I hoped you'd be here.""""Never miss a market, lady,"" he thundered, cheerfully. Then he confided, like an explosion with a secret, ""This's where the business is, y'see. Now,"" he said, recollecting the cooling lump of metal on his anvil, ""just you wait here a moment."" He put Door down at eye level, on the top of his booth,, seven feet above the deck.He banged the lump of metal with his hammer, twisting it as he did so with implements Richard assumed, correctly, were tongs. Under the hammer blows it changed from a shapeless blob of orange metal into a perfect black rose. It was a work of astonishing delicacy, each petal perfect and distinct. Hammersmith dipped the rose into a bucket of cold water beside the anvil: it hissed and steamed. Then he pulled it out of the bucket, wiped it, and handed it to a fat man in chain mail who was standing, patiently, to one side; the fat man professed himself well satisfied and gave Hammersmith, in return, a green plastic Marks and Spencer shopping bag, filled with various kinds of cheese.""Hammersmith?"" said Door, from her perch. ""These are my friends.""Hammersmith enveloped Richard's hand in one several sizes up. His handshake was enthusiastic, but very gentle, as if he had, in the past, had a number of accidents shaking hands and had practiced it until he got it right. ""Charmed,"" he boomed.""Richard,"" said Richard.Hammersmith looked delighted. ""Richard! Fine name! I had a horse called Richard."" He let go of Richard's hand, turned to Hunter, and said, ""And you are . . . Hunter? Hunter! As I live, breathe, and defecate! It is!"" Hammersmith blushed like a schoolboy. He spat on his hand and attempted, awkwardly, to plaster his hair back. Then he stuck his hand out and realized that he had just spat on it, and he wiped it on his leather apron, and shifted his weight from foot to foot.""Hammersmith,"" said Hunter, with a perfect caramel smile.""Hammersmith?"" asked Door. ""Will you help me down?""He looked shamefaced. ""Beg pardon, lady,"" he said, and lifted her down. It came to Richard then that Hammersmith had known Door as a small child, and he found himself feeling unaccountably jealous of the huge man. ""Now,"" Hammersmith was saying to Door, ""What can I do for you?""""Couple of things,"" she said. ""But first of all-"" She turned to Richard. ""Richard? I've got a job for you.""Hunter raised an eyebrow. ""For him?""Door nodded. ""For both of you. Will you go and find us some food? Please?"" Richard felt oddly proud. He had proved himself in the ordeal. He was One of Them. He would Go, and he would Bring Back Food. He puffed out his chest.""I am your bodyguard. I stay by your side,"" said Hunter.Door grinned. Her eyes flashed. ""In the market? It's okay, Hunter. Market Truce holds. No one's going to touch me here. And Richard needs looking after more than I do."" Richard deflated, but no one was watching.""And what if someone violates the Truce?"" asked Hunter.Hammersmith shivered, despite the heat of his brazier. ""Violate the Market Truce? Brrrr.""""It's not going to happen. Go on. Both of you. Curry, please. And get me some papadums, please. Spicy ones.""Hunter ran her hand through her hair. Then she turned and walked off into the crowd, and Richard went with her. ""So what would happen if someone violated Market Truce?"" asked Richard, as they pushed through the crowds.Hunter thought about this for a moment. ""The last time it happened was about three hundred years ago. A couple of friends got into an argument over a woman, in the market. A knife was pulled and one of them died. The other fled.""""What happened to him? Was he killed?""Hunter shook her head. ""Quite the opposite. He still wishes he had been the one to have died.""""He's still alive?""Hunter pursed her lips. ""Ish,"" she said, after a while. ""Alive-ish.""A moment passed, then ""Phew,"" Richard thought he was going to be ill. ""What's that-that stink?""""Sewer Folk.""Richard averted his head and tried not to breathe through his nose until they were well away from the Sewer Folk's stall.""Any sign of the marquis yet?"" he asked. Hunter shook her head. She could have reached out her hand and touched him. They went up a gangplank, toward the food stalls, and more welcoming aromas.Old Bailey found the Sewer Folk with little difficulty, following his nose.He knew what he had to do, and he took a certain pleasure in making a bit of a performance of it, ostentatiously examining the dead cocker spaniel, the artificial leg, and the damp and moldy portable telephone, and shaking his head dolorously at each of them. Then he made a point of noticing the marquis's body. He scratched his nose. He put on his spectacles and peered at it. He nodded to himself, glumly, hoping to give the vague impression of being a man in need of a corpse who was disappointed by the selection but was going to have to make do with what they had. Then he beckoned to Dunnikin, and pointed to the corpse.Dunnikin opened his hands wide, smiled beatifically, and gazed up toward the heavens, conveying the bliss with which the marquis's remains had entered their life. He put a hand to his forehead, lowered it, and looked devastated, in order to convey the tragedy that losing such a remarkable corpse would be.Old Bailey put a hand in his pocket and produced a half-used stick of deodorant. He handed it to Dunnikin, who squinted at it, licked it, and handed it back, unimpressed. Old Bailey pocketed it. He looked back at the corpse of the marquis de Carabas, half-dressed, barefoot, still damp from its journey through the sewers. The body was ashen, drained of blood from many cuts, small and large, and the skin was wrinkled and prunelike from its time in the water.Then he pulled out a bottle, three-quarters filled with a yellow liquid, and passed it to Dunnikin. Dunnikin looked at it suspiciously. The Sewer Folk know what a bottle of Chanel No. 5 looks like, and they gathered around Dunnikin, staring. Carefully, self-importantly, he unscrewed the top of the bottle and dabbed the tiniest amount on his wrist. Then, with a gravity the finest Parisian parfumier would have envied, Dunnikin sniffed. Then he nodded his head, enthusiastically, and approached Old Bailey to embrace him and conclude the deal. The old man averted his face and held his breath until the embrace was concluded.Old Bailey held up one finger and tried his best to mime that he was not so young as once he was and that, dead or not, the marquis de Carabas was a bit on the heavy side. Dunnikin picked his nose thoughtfully, and then, with a hand gesture indicating not only magnanimity but also a foolish and misplaced generosity that would, obviously, send him, Dunnikin, and the rest of the Sewer Folk, to the poorhouse, he had one of the younger Sewer Folk tie the corpse to the bottom half of the old baby carriage.The old roof-man covered the body with a cloth, and he pulled it away from the Sewer Folk, across the crowded deck.""One portion of vegetable curry, please,"" said Richard, to the woman at the curry stall. ""And, um, I was wondering. The meat curry. What kind of meat is it, then?"" The woman told him. ""Oh,"" said Richard. ""Right. Um. Better just make that vegetable curries all round.""""Hello again,"" said a rich voice beside him. It was the pale woman they had met in the caves, with the black dress and the foxglove eyes.""Hullo,"" said Richard, with a smile. ""-Oh, and some papadums, please. You, um. Here for curry?""She fixed him with her violet gaze and said, in mock Bela Lugosi, ""I do not eat . . . curry."" And then she laughed, a lavish, delighted laugh, and Richard found himself realizing how long it had been since he had shared a joke with a woman.""Oh. Um. Richard. Richard Mayhew."" He stuck out his hand. She touched it with her own hand, in something a little like a handshake. Her fingers were very cold, but then, late at night, at the end of autumn, on a ship out on the Thames, everything is very cold.""Lamia,"" she said. ""I'm a Velvet.""""Ah,"" he said. ""Right. Are there a lot of you?""""A few,"" she said.Richard collected the containers with the curry. ""What do you do?"" he asked.""When I'm not looking for food,"" she said, with a smile, ""I'm a guide. I know every inch of the Underside.""Hunter, who Richard could have sworn had been over on the other side of the stall, was standing next to Lamia. She said, ""He's not yours.""Lamia smiled sweetly. ""I'll be the judge of that,"" she said.Richard said, ""Hunter, this is Lamia. She's a Velcro.""""Vel-vet,"" corrected Lamia, sweetly.""She's a guide.""""I'll take you wherever you want to go.""Hunter took the bag with the food in it from Richard. ""Time to go back,"" she said.""Well,"" said Richard. ""If we're off to see the you-know-what, maybe she could help.""Hunter said nothing; instead, she looked at Richard. Had she looked at him that way the day before, he would have dropped the subject. But that was then. ""Let's see what Door thinks,"" said Richard. ""Any sign of the marquis?""""Not yet,"" said Hunter.Old Bailey had dragged the corpse down the gangplank tied to its baby carriage-base, like a ghastly Guy Fawkes, one of the effigies that, not so very long ago, the children of London had wheeled and dragged around in early November, displaying to passersby before tossing them to their flaming demise on the bonfires of the fifth of November, Bonfire Night. He pulled the corpse over Tower Bridge, and, muttering and complaining, he hauled it up the hill past the Tower of London. He made his way west toward Tower Hill Station and stopped a little before the station, beside a large gray jut of wall. It wasn't a roof, thought Old Bailey, but it would do. It was one of the last remnants of the London Wall. The London Wall, according to tradition, was built on the orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, in the third century A.D., at the request of his mother Helena. At that point, London was one of the few great cities of the Empire that did not yet have a magnificent wall. When it was finished it enclosed the small city completely; it was thirty feet high, and eight feet wide, and was, unarguably, the London Wall.It was no longer thirty feet high, the ground level having risen since Constantine's mother's day (most of the original London Wall is fifteen feet below street level today), and it no longer enclosed the city. But it was still an imposing lump of wall. Old Bailey nodded vigorously to himself. He fastened a length of rope to the baby carriage, and he scrambled up the wall; then, grunting and 'bless-me'-ing, he hauled the marquis up to the top of the wall. He untied the body from the carriage wheels and laid it gently out on its back, arms at its side. There were wounds on the body that were still oozing. It was very dead. ""You stupid bugger,"" whispered Old Bailey, sadly. ""What did you want to get yourself killed for, anyway?""The moon was bright and small and high in the cold night, and autumn constellations speckled the blue-black sky like the dust of crushed diamonds. A nightingale fluttered onto the wall, examined the corpse of the marquis de Carabas, and chirruped sweetly. ""None of your beak,"" said Old Bailey, gruffly. ""You birds don't smell like flipping roses, neither."" The bird chirped a melodious nightingale obscenity at him, and flew off into the night.Old Bailey reached into his pocket and pulled out the black rat, who had gone to sleep. It stared about it sleepily, then yawned, displaying a vast and ratty expanse of piebald tongue. ""Personally,"" said Old Bailey to the black rat, ""I'll be happy if I never smell anything ever again."" He put it down by his feet on the stones of London Wall, and it chittered at him, and gestured with its front paws. Old Bailey sighed. Carefully, he took the silver box out of his pocket, and, from an inner pocket, he pulled the toasting fork.He placed the silver box on de Carabas's chest, then, nervously, he reached out the toasting fork, and flipped open the lid of the box. Inside the silver box, on a nest of red velvet, was a large duck's egg, pale blue green in the moonlight. Old Bailey raised the toasting fork, closed his eyes, and brought it down on the egg.There was a whup as it imploded. There was a great stillness for several seconds after that; then the wind began. It had no direction, but seemed somehow to be coming from everywhere, a swirling sudden gale. Fallen leaves, newspaper pages, all the city's detritus blew up from the ground and was driven through the air. The wind touched the surface of the Thames and carried the cold water into the sky in a fine and driving spray. It was a dangerous, crazy wind. The stall holders on the deck of the Belfast cursed it and clutched their possessions to keep them from blowing away.And then, when it seemed that the wind would become so strong that it would blow the world away and blow the stars away and send the people tumbling through the air like so many desiccated autumn leaves-Just then--it was over, and the leaves, and the papers, and the plastic shopping bags, tumbled to the earth, and the road, and the water.High on the remnant of the London Wall, the silence that followed the wind was, in its way, as loud as the wind had been. It was broken by a cough; a horrid, wet coughing. This was followed by the sound of someone awkwardly rolling over; and then the sound of someone being sick.The marquis de Carabas vomited sewer water over the side of the London Wall, staining the gray stones with brown foulness. It took a long time to purge the water from his body. And then he said, in a hoarse voice that was little more than a grinding whisper, ""I think my throat's been cut. Have you anything to bind it with?""Old Bailey fumbled in his pockets and pulled out a grubby length of cloth. He passed it to the marquis, who wrapped it around his throat a few times and then tied it tight. Old Bailey found himself reminded, incongruously, of the high-wrapped Beau Brummel collars of the Regency dandies. ""Anything to drink?"" croaked the marquis.Old Bailey pulled out his hip-flask and unscrewed the top, and passed it to the marquis, who swigged back a mouthful, then winced with pain, and coughed weakly. The black rat, who had watched all this with interest, now began to climb down the fragment of wall and away. It would tell the Golden: all favors had been repaid, all debts were done.The marquis gave Old Bailey back his hip-flask. Old Bailey put it away. ""How are ye feeling?"" he asked.""I've felt better."" The marquis sat up, shivering. His nose was running, and his eyes flickered about: he was staring at the world as if he had never seen it before.""What did you have to go and get yourself killed for, anyway, that's what I want to know,"" asked Old Bailey.""Information,"" whispered the marquis. ""People tell you so much more when they know you're just about to be dead. And then they talk around you, when you are.""""Then you found out what you wanted to know?""The marquis fingered the wounds in his arms and his legs, ""Oh yes. Most of it. I have more than an inkling of what this affair is actually about."" Then he closed his eyes once more, and wrapped his arms about himself, and swayed, slowly, back and forth.""What's it like then?"" asked Old Bailey. ""Being dead?""The marquis sighed. And then he twisted his lips up into a smile, and with a glitter of his old self, he replied, ""Live long enough, Old Bailey, and you can find out for yourself.""Old Bailey looked disappointed. ""Bastard. After all I done to bring you back from that dread bourne from which there is no returning. Well usually no returning.""The marquis de Carabas looked up at him. His eyes were very white in the moonlight. And he whispered, ""What's it like being dead? It's very cold, my friend. Very dark, and very cold.""Door held up the chain. The silver key hung from it, red and orange in the light of Hammersmith's brazier. She smiled. ""Fine work, Hammersmith.""""Thank you, lady.""She hung the chain around her neck and hid the key away inside her layers of clothes. ""What would you like in return?""The smith looked abashed. ""I hardly want to presume upon your good nature . . . "" he mumbled.Door made her ""get on with it"" face. He bent down and produced a black box from beneath a pile of metalworking tools. It was made of dark wood, inlaid with ivory and mother-of-pearl, and was the size of a large dictionary. He turned it over and over in his hands. ""It's a puzzle-box,"" he explained. ""I took it in return for some smithing a handful of years back. I can't get it to open, though I've tried so hard.""Door took the box and ran her fingers over the smooth surface. ""I'm not surprised you haven't been able to open it. The mechanism's all jammed. It's completely fused shut.""Hammersmith looked glum. ""So I'll never find out what's in it.""Door made an amused face. Her fingers explored the surface of the box. A rod slid-out of the side of the box. She half-pushed the rod back into the box, then twisted. There was a clunk from deep inside it, and a door opened in the side. ""Here,"" said Door.""My lady,"" said Hammersmith. He took the box from her and pulled the door open all the way. There was a drawer inside the box, which he pulled open. The small toad, in the drawer, croaked and looked about itself with copper eyes, incuriously. Hammersmith's face fell. ""I was hoping it would be diamonds and pearls,"" he said.Door reached out a hand and stroked the toad's head. ""He's got pretty eyes,"" she said. ""Keep him, Hammersmith. He'll bring you luck. And thank you again. I know I can rely on your discretion.""""You can rely on me, lady,"" said Hammersmith, earnestly.They sat together on the top of the London Wall, not speaking. Old Bailey slowly lowered the baby carriage wheels to the ground below them. ""Where's the market?"" asked the marquis.Old Bailey pointed to the gunship. ""Over there.""""Door and the others. They'll be expecting me.""""You aren't in any condition to go anywhere."" The marquis coughed, painfully. It sounded, to Old Bailey, like there was still plenty of sewer in his lungs. ""I've made a long enough journey today,"" de Carabas whispered. ""A little farther won't hurt."" He examined his hands, flexed the fingers slowly, as if to see whether or not they would do as he wished. And then he twisted his body around, and began, awkwardly, to climb down the side of the wall. But before he did so, he said, hoarsely and perhaps a little sadly, ""It would seem, Old Bailey, that I owe you a favor.""When Richard returned with the curries, Door ran to him and threw her arms around him. She hugged him tightly, and even patted his bottom, before seizing the paper bag from him and pulling it open with enthusiasm. She took a container of vegetable curry and began, happily, to eat.""Thanks,"" said Door, with her mouth full. ""Any sign of the marquis yet?""""None,"" said Hunter.""Croup and Vandemar?""""No.""""Yummy curry. This is really good.""""Got the chain all right?"" asked Richard. Door pulled the chain up from around her neck, enough to show it was there, and she let it fall again, the weight of the key pulling it back down.""Door,"" said Richard, ""this is Lamia. She's a guide. She says she can take us anywhere in the Underside.""""Anywhere?"" Door munched a papadum.""Anywhere,"" said Lamia.Door put her head on one side. ""Do you know where the Angel Islington is?""Lamia blinked, slowly, long lashes covering and revealing her foxglove-colored eyes. ""Islington?"" she said. ""You can't go there . . . """"Do you know?""""Down Street,"" said Lamia. ""The end of Down Street. But it's not safe.""Hunter had been watching this conversation, arms folded and unimpressed. Now she said, ""We don't need a guide.""""Well,"" said Richard, ""I think we do. The marquis isn't around anywhere. We know it's going to be a dangerous journey. We have to get the . . . the thing I got . . . to the Angel. And then he'll tell Door about her family, and he'll tell me how to get home.""Lamia looked up at Hunter with delight. ""And he can give you brains,"" she said, cheerfully, ""and me a heart.""Door wiped the last of the curry from her bowl with her fingers, and licked them. ""We'll be fine, just the three of us, Richard. We cannot afford a guide.""Lamia bridled. ""I'll take my payment from him, not you.""""And what payment would your kind demand?"" asked Hunter.""That,"" said Lamia with a sweet smile, ""is for me to know and him to wonder.""Door shook her head. ""I really don't think so.""Richard snorted. ""You just don't like it that I'm figuring everything out for once, instead of following blindly behind you, going where I'm told.""""That's not it at all.""Richard turned to Hunter. ""Well, Hunter. Do you know the way to Islington?"" Hunter shook her head.Door sighed. ""We should get a move on. Down Street, you say?""Lamia smiled with plum-colored lips. ""Yes, lady.""By the time the marquis reached the market they were gone.
NW_ch15	NW	Neverwhere	15	4285	24480	NeverwhereFIFTEENThey walked off the ship, down the long gangplank, and onto the shore, where they went down some steps, through a long, unlit underpass, and up again. Lamia strode confidently ahead of them. She brought them out in a small, cobbled alley. Gaslights burned and sputtered on the walls.""Third door along,"" she said.They stopped in front of the door. There was a brass plate on it, which said:THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO HOUSESAnd beneath that, in smaller letters:DOWN STREET. PLEASE KNOCK.""You get to the street through the house?"" asked Richard.""No,"" said Lamia. ""The street is in the house."" Richard knocked on the door. Nothing happened. They waited, and they shivered from the early morning cold. Richard knocked again. Finally, he rang the doorbell. The door was opened by a sleepy-looking footman, wearing a powdered, crooked wig and scarlet livery. He looked at the motley rabble on his doorstep with an expression that indicated that they had not been worth getting out of bed for.""Can I help you?"" said the footman. Richard had been told to fuck off and die with more warmth and good humor.""Down Street,"" said Lamia, imperiously.""This way,"" sighed the footman. ""If you'll wipe your feet.""They walked through an impressive lobby. Then they waited while the footman lit each of the candles on a candelabra. They went down some impressive, richly carpeted stairs. They went down a flight of less impressive, less richly carpeted stairs. They went down a flight of entirely unimpressive stairs carpeted in a threadbare brown sacking, and, finally, they went down a flight of drab wooden stairs with no carpet on them at all.At the bottom of those stairs was an antique service elevator, with a sign on it. The sign said:OUT OF ORDERThe footman ignored the sign and pulled open the wire outer door with a metallic thud. Lamia thanked him, politely, and stepped into the elevator. The others followed. The footman turned his back on them. Richard watched him through the wire mesh, clutching his candelabra, going back up the wooden stairs. There was a short row of black buttons on the wall of the elevator. Lamia pressed the bottom-most button. The metal lattice door closed automatically, with a bang. A motor engaged, and the elevator began, slowly, creakily, to descend. The four of them stood packed in the elevator. Richard realized that he could smell each of the women in the elevator with him: Door smelled mostly of curry; Hunter smelled, not unpleasantly, of sweat, in a way that made him think of great cats in cages at zoos; while Lamia smelled, intoxicatingly, of honeysuckle and lily of the valley and musk.The elevator continued to descend. Richard was sweating, in a clammy cold sweat, and digging his fingernails deep into his palms. In the most conversational tones he could muster, he said, ""Now would be a very bad time to discover that one was claustrophobic, wouldn't it?""""Yes,"" said Door.""Then I won't,"" said Richard. And they went down.Finally, there was a jerk, and a clunk, and a ratcheting noise, and the elevator stopped. Hunter pulled open the door, looked about, and then stepped out onto a narrow ledge.Richard looked out of the open elevator door. They were hanging in the air, at the top of something that reminded Richard of a painting he had once seen of the Tower of Babel, or rather of how the Tower of Babel might have looked were it inside out. It was an enormous and ornate spiral path, carved out of rock, which went down and down around a central well. Lights flickered dimly, here and there in the walls, beside the paths, and, far, far below them, tiny fires were burning. It was at the top of the central well, a few thousand feet above solid ground, that the elevator was hanging. It swayed a little.Richard took a deep breath and followed the others onto the wooden ledge. Then, although he knew it was a bad idea, he looked down. There was nothing but a wooden board between him and the rock floor, thousands of feet below. There was a long plank stretched between the ledge on which they stood and the top of the rocky path, twenty feet away. ""And I suppose,"" he said, with a great deal less insouciance than he imagined, ""this wouldn't be a good time to point out that I'm really bad at heights.""""It's safe,"" said Lamia. ""Or it was the last time I was here. Watch."" She walked across the board, a rustle of black velvet. She could have balanced a dozen books on her head and never dropped one. When she reached the stone path at the side, she stopped, and turned, and smiled at them encouragingly. Hunter followed her across, then turned, and waited beside her on the edge.""See?"" said Door. She reached out a hand, squeezed Richard's arm. ""It's fine."" Richard nodded, and swallowed. Fine. Door walked across. She did not seem to be enjoying herself; but she crossed, nonetheless. The three women waited for Richard, who stood there. Richard noticed after a while that he did not seem to be starting to walk across the wooden plank, despite the ""walk!"" commands he was sending to his legs.Far above them, a button was pressed: Richard heard the thunk and the distant grinding of an elderly electric motor. The door of the elevator slammed closed behind him, leaving Richard standing, precariously, on a narrow wooden platform, no wider than a plank itself.""Richard!"" shouted Door. ""Move!""The elevator began to ascend. Richard stepped off the shaking platform, and onto the wooden board; then his legs turned to jelly beneath him, and he found himself on all fours on the plank, holding on for dear life. There was a tiny, rational part of his mind that wondered about the elevator: who had called it back up, and why? The rest of his mind, however, was engaged in telling all his limbs to clutch the plank rigidly, and in screaming, at the top of its mental voice, ""I don't want to die."" Richard closed his eyes as tightly as he could, certain that if he opened them, and saw the rock wall below him, he would simply let go of the plank, and fall, and fall, and-""I'm not scared of falling,"" he told himself. ""The part I'm scared of is where you finish falling."" But he knew he was lying to himself. It was the fall he was scared of-afraid of flailing and tumbling helplessly through the air, down to the rock floor far below, knowing there was nothing he could do to save himself, no miracle that would save him . . .He slowly became aware that someone was talking to him.""Just climb along the plank, Richard,"" someone was saying.""I . . . can't,"" he whispered.""You went through worse than this to get the key, Richard,"" someone said. It was Door talking.""I'm really not very good at heights,"" he said, obstinately, his face pressed against the wooden board, his teeth chartering. Then, ""I want to go home."" He felt the wood of the plank pressing against his face. And then the plank began to shake. Hunter's voice said, ""I'm really not sure how much weight the board will bear. You two put your weight here."" The plank vibrated as someone moved along it, toward him. He clung to it, with his eyes closed. Then Hunter said, quietly, confidently, in his ear, ""Richard?""""Mm.""""Just edge forward, Richard. A bit at a time. Come on . . . "" Her caramel fingers stroked his white-knuckled hand, clasping the plank. ""Come on.""He took a deep breath, and inched forward. And froze again. ""You're doing fine,"" said Hunter. ""That's good. Come on."" And, inch by inch, creep by crawl, she talked Richard along the plank, and then, at the end of the plank, she simply picked him up, her hands beneath his arms, and placed him on solid ground.""Thank you,"" he said. He could not think of anything else to say to Hunter that would be big enough to cover what she had just done for him. He said it again. ""Thank you."" And then he said, to all of them, ""I'm sorry.""Door looked up at him. ""It's okay,"" she said. ""You're safe now."" Richard looked at the winding spiral road beneath the world, going down, and down; and he looked at Hunter and Door and Lamia; and he laughed until he wept.""What,"" Door demanded, when, at length, he had stopped laughing, ""is so funny?""""Safe,"" he said, simply. Door stared at him, and then she, too, smiled. ""So where do we go now?"" Richard asked.""Down,"" said Lamia. They began to walk down Down Street. Hunter was in the lead, with Door beside her. Richard walked next to Lamia, breathing in the lily-of-the-valley-honeysuckle scent of her, and enjoying her company.""I really appreciate you coming with us,"" he told her. ""Being a guide. I hope it's not going to be bad luck for you or anything.""She fixed him with her foxglove-colored eyes. ""Why should it be bad luck?""""Do you know who the rat-speakers are?""""Of course.""""There was a rat-speaker girl named Anaesthesia. She. Well, we got to be sort of friends, and she was guiding me somewhere. And then she got stolen. On Night's Bridge. I keep wondering what happened to her.""She smiled at him sympathetically. ""My people have stories about that. Some of them may even be true.""""You'll have to tell me about them,"" he said. It was cold. His breath was steaming in the chilly air.""One day,"" she said. Her breath did not steam. ""It's very good of you, taking me with you.""""Least we could do.""Door and Hunter went around the curve in front of them, and went out of sight. ""You know,"" said Richard, ""the other two are getting a bit ahead of us. We might want to hurry.""""Let them go,"" she said, gently. ""We'll catch up."" It was, thought Richard, peculiarly like going to a movie with a girl as a teenager. Or rather, like walking home afterwards: stopping at bus shelters, or beside walls, to snatch a kiss, a hasty fumble of skin and a tangle of tongues, then hurrying on to catch up with your friends . . .Lamia ran a cold finger down his cheek. ""You're so warm,"" she said, admiringly. -""It must be wonderful to have so much warmth.""Richard tried to look modest. ""It's not something I think about much, really,"" he admitted. He heard, distantly, from above, the metallic slam of the elevator door.Lamia looked up at him, pleadingly, sweetly. ""Would you give me some of your heat, Richard?"" she asked. ""I'm so cold.""Richard wondered if he should kiss her. ""What? I . . . ""She looked disappointed. ""Don't you like me?"" she asked. He hoped, desperately, that he had not hurt her feelings.""Of course I like you,"" he heard his voice saying. ""You're very nice.""""And you aren't using all your heat, are you?"" she pointed out, reasonably.""I suppose not . . . """"And you said you'd pay me for being your guide. And it's what I want, as my payment. Warmth. Can I have some?""Anything she wanted. Anything. The honeysuckle and the lily of the valley wrapped around him, and his eyes saw nothing but her pale skin and her dark plum-bloom lips, and her jet black hair. He nodded. Somewhere inside him something was screaming; but whatever it was, it could wait. She reached up her hands to his face and pulled it gently down toward her. Then she kissed him, long and languorously. There was a moment of initial shock at the chill of her lips, and the cold of her tongue, and then he succumbed to her kiss entirely.After some time, she pulled back.He could feel the ice on his lips. He stumbled back against the wall. He tried to blink, but his eyes felt as if they were frozen open. She looked up at him and smiled delightedly, her skin flushed and pink and her lips, scarlet; her breath steamed in the cold air. She licked her red lips with a warm crimson tongue. His world began to go dark. He thought he saw a black shape at the edge of his vision.""More,"" she said. And she reached out to him.He watched the Velvet pull Richard to her for the first kiss, watched the rime and the frost spread over Richard's skin. He watched her pull back, happily. And then he walked up behind her, and, as she moved in to finish what she had begun, he reached out and seized her, hard, by the neck, and lifted her off the ground.""Give it back,"" he rasped in her ear. ""Give him back his life."" The Velvet reacted like a kitten who had just been dropped into a bathtub, wriggling and hissing and spitting and scratching. It did her no good: she was held tight by the throat.""You can't make me,"" she said, in decidedly unmusical tones.He increased the pressure. ""Give him his life back,"" he told her, hoarsely and honestly, ""or I'll break your neck."" She winced. He pushed her toward Richard, frozen and crumpled against the rock wall.She took Richard's hand, and breathed into his nose and mouth. Vapor came from her mouth, and trickled into his. The ice on his skin began to thaw, the rime on his hair to vanish. He squeezed her neck again. ""All of it, Lamia."" She hissed, then, extremely grudgingly, and opened her mouth once more. A final puff of steam drifted from her mouth to his, and vanished inside him. Richard blinked. The ice on his eyes had melted to tears, and they were running down his cheeks. ""What did you do to me?"" he asked.""She was drinking your life,"" said the marquis de Carabas, in a hoarse whisper. ""Taking your warmth. Turning you into a cold thing like her.""Lamia's face twisted, like a tiny child deprived of a favorite toy. Her foxglove eyes flashed. ""I need it more than he does,"" she wailed.""I thought you liked me,"" said Richard, stupidly.The marquis picked Lamia up, one-handed, and brought her face close to his. ""Go near him again, you or any of the Velvet Children, and I'll come by day to your cavern, while you sleep, and I'll burn it to the ground. Understand?""Lamia nodded. He let go of her, and she dropped to the floor. Then she pulled herself up to her full size, which was not terribly tall, threw back her head, and spat, hard, into the marquis's face. She picked up the front of her black velvet dress and ran up the slope, and away, her footsteps echoing through the winding rock path of Down Street, while her ice-cold spittle ran down the marquis's cheek. He wiped it away with the back of his hand.""She was going to kill me,"" stammered Richard.""Not immediately,"" said the marquis, dismissively. ""You would have died eventually, though, when she finished eating your life.""Richard stared at the marquis. His skin was filthy, and he seemed ashen beneath the dark of his skin. His coat was gone: instead, he wore an old blanket wrapped about his shoulders, like a poncho, with something bulky-Richard could not tell what- strapped beneath it. He was barefoot, and, in what Richard took to be some kind of bizarre fashion affectation, there was a discolored cloth wrapped all the way around his throat.""We were looking for you,"" said Richard.""And now you've found me,"" croaked the marquis, drily.""We were expecting to see you at the market.""""Yes. Well. Some people thought I was dead. I was forced to keep a low profile.""""Why . . . why did some people think you were dead?""The marquis looked at Richard with eyes that had seen too much and gone too far. ""Because they killed me,"" he said. ""Come on, the others can't be too far ahead.""Richard looked over the side of the path, across the central well. He could see Door and Hunter, across the well, on the level below. They were looking around-for him, he assumed. He called to them, shouted and waved, but the sound did not carry. The marquis laid a hand upon Richard's arm. ""Look,"" he said. He pointed to the level beneath Door and Hunter. Something moved. Richard squinted: he could make out two figures, standing in the shadows. ""Croup and Vandemar,"" said the marquis. ""It's a trap.""""What do we do?""""Run!"" said the marquis. ""Warn them. I can't run yet . . . go, damn you!""And Richard ran. He ran as fast as he could, as hard as he could, down the sloping stone road under the world. He felt a sudden stabbing pain in his chest: a stitch. And he pushed himself on, and still he ran.He turned a corner, and he saw them all. ""Hunter! Door!"" he gasped, breathless. ""Stop! Watch out!""Door turned. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar stepped out from behind a pillar. Mr. Vandemar yanked Door's hands behind her back and bound them in one movement with a nylon strip. Mr. Croup was holding something long and thin in a brown cloth cover, like the kind Richard's father had used to carry his fishing poles in. Hunter stood there, her mouth open. Richard shouted, ""Hunter. Quickly.""She nodded, spun around, and kicked out one foot, in a smooth, almost balletic, motion.Her foot caught Richard squarely in the stomach. He fell to the floor several feet away, winded and breathless and hurt. ""Hunter?"" he gasped.""I'm afraid so,"" said Hunter, and she turned away. Richard felt sick, and saddened. The betrayal hurt him as much as the blow.Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar ignored Richard and Hunter entirely. Mr. Vandemar was trussing Door's arms, while Mr. Croup stood and watched. ""Don't think of us as murderers and cutthroats, miss,"" Mr. Croup was saying, conversationally. ""Think of us as an escort service.""Hunter stood beside the rock face, looking at none of them, and Richard lay on the rock floor and writhed and tried, somehow, to suck air back into his lungs. Mr. Croup turned back to Door and smiled, showing many teeth. ""You see, Lady Door. We are going to make sure you get safely to your destination.""Door ignored him. ""Hunter,"" she called, ""what's happening?"" Hunter did not move, nor did she answer.Mr. Croup beamed, proudly. ""Before Hunter agreed to work for you, she agreed to work for our principal. Taking care of you.""""We told you,"" crowed Mr. Vandemar. ""We told you one of you was a traitor."" He threw back his head, and howled like a wolf.""I thought you were talking about the marquis,"" said Door.Mr. Croup scratched his head of orange hair, theatrically. ""Talking of the marquis, I wonder where he is. He's a bit late, isn't he, Mister Vandemar?""""Very late indeed, Mister Croup. As late as he possibly could be.""Mr. Croup coughed sententiously and delivered his punch line. ""Then from now on, we'll have to call him the late marquis de Carabas. I'm afraid he's ever-so-slightly-""""Dead as a doornail,"" finished Mr. Vandemar. Richard finally managed to get enough air into his lungs to gasp, ""You traitorous bitch.""Hunter glanced at the ground. ""No hard feelings,"" she whispered.""The key you obtained from the Black Friars,"" said Mr. Croup to Door. ""Who has it?""""I do,"" gasped Richard. ""You can search me, if you like. Look."" He fumbled in his pockets-noticing something hard and unfamiliar in his back pocket, but there was no time to investigate that now-and he pulled out the front-door key of his old flat. He dragged himself to his feet and staggered over to Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar. ""Here.""Mr. Croup reached over and took the key from him. ""Good gracious me,"" he said; scarcely glancing at it. ""I find myself utterly taken in by his cunning ploy, Mister Vandemar."" He passed the key to Mr. Vandemar, who held it up between finger and thumb, and crushed it like brass foil. ""Fooled again, Mister Croup,"" he said.""Hurt him, Mister Vandemar,"" said Mr. Croup.""With pleasure, Mister Croup,"" said Mr. Vandemar, and he kicked Richard in the kneecap. Richard fell to the ground, in agony. As if from a long way away, he could hear Mr. Vandemar's voice; it appeared to be lecturing him. ""People think it's how hard you kick that hurts,"" Mr. Vandemar's voice was saying. ""But it's not how hard you kick. It's where. I mean, this's really a very gentle kick . . . ""- something slammed into Richard's left shoulder. His left arm went numb, and a purple-white blossom of pain opened up in his shoulder. It felt like his whole arm was on fire, and freezing, as if someone had jabbed an electrical prod deep into his flesh, and turned up the current as high as it would go. He whimpered. And Mr. Vandemar was saying, "" . . . but it hurts just as much as this-which is much harder . . . "" and the boot rammed into Richard's side like a cannonball. He could hear himself screaming.""I've got the key,"" he heard Door say.""If only you had a Swiss army knife,"" Mr. Vandemar told Richard, helpfully, ""I could show you what I do with all the different bits. Even the bottle-opener, and the thing for getting stones out of horses' hooves.""""Leave him, Mister Vandemar. There will be time enough for Swiss army knives. Does she have the token?"" Mr. Croup fumbled in Door's pockets, and took out the carved obsidian figure: the tiny Beast the angel had given her.Hunter's voice was low and resonant. ""What about me? Where's my payment?""Mr. Croup sniffed. He tossed her the fishing pole case. She caught it one-handed. ""Good hunting,"" said Mr. Croup. Then he and Mr. Vandemar turned and walked off down the twisting slope of Down Street, with Door between them. Richard lay on the floor and watched them go, with a terrible feeling of despair spreading outward from his heart.Hunter knelt on the ground and began to undo the straps on the case. Her eyes were wide and shining. Richard ached. ""What is it?"" he asked. ""Thirty pieces of silver?"" She pulled it, slowly, from its fabric cover, her fingers caressing it, stroking it, loving it. ""A spear,"" she said, simply.It was made of a bronze-colored metal; the blade was long, and it curved like a kris, sharp on one side, serrated on the other; there were faces carved into the side of the haft, which was green with verdigris, and decorated with strange designs and odd curlicues. It was about five feet long, from the tip of the blade to the end of the haft. Hunter touched it, almost fearfully, as if it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.""You sold Door out for a spear,"" said Richard. Hunter said nothing. She wetted a fingertip with her pink tongue, then gently ran it across the side of the head of the spear, testing the edge on the blade; and then she smiled, as if she were satisfied with what she felt. ""Are you going to kill me?"" Richard asked. He was surprised to find himself no longer scared of death-or at least, he realized, he was not scared of that death.She turned her head, then, and looked at him. She looked more alive than he had ever seen her; more beautiful, and more dangerous. ""And what kind of challenge would I have hunting you, Richard Mayhew?"" she asked, with a vivid smile. ""I have bigger game to kill.""""This is your Great-Beast-of-London-hunting spear, isn't it?"" he said.She looked at the spear in a way that no woman had ever looked at Richard. ""They say that nothing can stand against it.""""But Door trusted you. I trusted you.""She was no longer smiling. ""Enough.""Slowly, the pain was beginning to abate, dwindling to a dull ache in his shoulder and his side and his knee. ""So who are you working for? Where are they taking her? Who's behind all this?""""Tell him, Hunter,"" rasped the marquis de Carabas. He was holding a crossbow pointed at Hunter. His bare feet were planted on the ground; his face was implacable.""I wondered whether you were as dead as Croup and Vandemar claimed you were,"" said Hunter, barely turning her head. ""You struck me as a hard man to kill.""He inclined his head, in an ironic bow, but his eyes did not move, and his hands remained steady. ""And you strike me that way too, dear lady. But a crossbow bolt to the throat, and a fall of several thousand feet may prove me wrong, eh? Put the spear down and step back."" She placed the spear on the floor, gently, lovingly; then she stood up and stepped back from it. ""You may as well tell him, Hunter,"" said the marquis. ""I know; I found out the hard way. Tell him who's behind all this.""""Islington,"" she said.Richard shook his head, as if he were trying to brush away a fly. ""It can't be,"" he said. ""I mean, I've met Islington. He's an angel."" And then, almost desperately, he asked, ""Why?""The marquis's eyes had not left Hunter, nor had the point of the crossbow wavered. ""I wish I knew. But Islington is at the bottom of Down Street, and at the bottom of this mess. And between us and Islington is the labyrinth and the Beast. Richard, take the spear. Hunter, walk in front of me, please.""Richard picked up the spear, and then, awkwardly, using the spear to lean on, he pulled himself up to a standing position. ""You want her to come with us?"" he asked, puzzled.""Would you prefer her behind us?"" asked the marquis, drily.""You could kill her,"" said Richard.""I will, if there are no other alternatives,"" said the marquis, ""but I would hate to remove an option, before it was entirely necessary. Anyway, death is so final, isn't it?""""Is it?"" asked Richard.""Sometimes,"" said the marquis de Carabas. And they went down.
NW_ch16	NW	Neverwhere	16	4153	23596	NeverwhereSIXTEENThey walked for hours in silence, following the winding stone road downwards. Richard was still in pain; he was limping, and experiencing a strange mental and physical turmoil: feelings of defeat and betrayal roiled within him, which, combined with the near loss of his life to Lamia, the damage inflicted by Mr. Vandemar, and his experiences on the plank far above, left him utterly wrecked. Yet, he was certain that his experiences of the last day paled into something small and insignificant when placed beside whatever the marquis had experienced. So he said nothing.The marquis kept silent, as every word he uttered hurt his throat. He was content to let it heal, and to concentrate on Hunter. He knew that, should he let his attention flag for even a moment, she would know it, and she would be away, or she would turn on them. So he said nothing.Hunter walked a little ahead of them. She, also, said nothing.After some hours, they reached the bottom of Down Street. The street ended in a vast Cyclopean gateway-built of enormous rough stone blocks. Giants built that gate, thought Richard, half-remembered tales of long-dead kings of mythical London churning in his head, tales of King Bran and of the giants Gog and Magog, with hands the size of oak trees, and severed heads as big as hills. The portal itself had long since rusted and crumbled away. Fragments of it could be seen in the mud beneath their feet, dangling uselessly from a rusted hinge on the side of the gate. The hinge was taller than Richard.The marquis gestured for Hunter to stop. He moistened his lips, and said, ""This gate marks the end of Down Street, and the beginning of the labyrinth. And beyond the labyrinth waits the Angel Islington. And in the labyrinth is the Beast.""""I still don't understand,"" said Richard. ""Islington. I actually met him. It. Him. He's an angel. I mean, a real angel.""The marquis smiled, without humor. ""When angels go bad, Richard, they go worse than anyone. Remember, Lucifer used to be an angel.""Hunter watched Richard with nut brown eyes. ""The place you visited is Islington's citadel, and also its prison,"" she said. It was the first thing she had said in hours. ""It cannot leave.""The marquis addressed her directly. ""I assume that the labyrinth and the Beast are there to discourage visitors.""She inclined her head. ""So I would assume also.""Richard turned on the marquis, all his anger and impotence and frustration spewing out of him in one angry blast. ""Why are you even talking to her? Why is she still with us? She was a traitor-she tried to make us think that you were the traitor.""""And I saved your life, Richard Mayhew,"" said Hunter, quietly. ""Many times. On the bridge. At the gap. On the board up there."" She looked into his eyes, and it was Richard who looked away.Something echoed through the tunnels: a bellow, or a roar. The hairs on the back of Richard's neck prickled. It was far away, but that was the only thing about it in which he could take any comfort. He knew that sound: he had heard it in his dreams, but now it sounded neither like a bull nor like a boar; it sounded like a lion; it sounded like a dragon.""The labyrinth is one of the oldest places in London Below,"" said the marquis. ""Before King Lud founded the village on the Thames marshes, there was a labyrinth here.""""No Beast, though,"" said Richard.""Not then.""Richard hesitated. The distant roaring began again. ""I . . . I think I've had dreams about the Beast,"" he said.The marquis raised an eyebrow. ""What kind of dreams?""""Bad ones,"" said Richard.The marquis thought about this, eyes flickering. And then he said, ""Look, Richard. I'm taking Hunter. But if you want to wait here, well, no one could accuse you of cowardice.""Richard shook his head. Sometimes there is nothing you can do. ""I'm not turning back. Not now. They've got Door.""""Right,"" said the marquis. ""Well then. Shall we go?""Hunter's perfect caramel lips twisted into a sneer. ""You'd have to be mad to go in there,"" she said. ""Without the angel's token you could never find your way. Never get past the boar.""The marquis reached his hand under his poncho blanket and produced the little obsidian statue he had taken from Door's father's study. ""One of these, you mean?"" he asked. The marquis felt, then, that much of what he had gone through in the previous week was made up for by the expression on Hunter's face. They went through the gate, into the labyrinth.Door's arms were bound behind her back, and Mr. Vandemar walked behind her, one huge beringed hand resting on her shoulder, pushing her along. Mr. Croup scuttled on ahead of them, holding the talisman he had taken from her on high, and peering edgily from side to side, like a particularly pompous weasel on its way to raid the henhouse.The labyrinth itself was a place of pure madness. It was built of lost fragments of London Above: alleys and roads and corridors and sewers that had fallen through the cracks over the millennia, and entered the world of the lost and the forgotten. The two men and the girl walked over cobbles, and through mud, and through dung of various kinds, and over rotting wooden boards. They walked through daylight and night, through gaslit streets, and sodium-lit streets, and streets lit with burning rushes and links. It was an ever-changing place: and each path divided and circled and doubled back on itself.Mr. Croup felt the tug of the talisman, and let it take him where it wanted to go. They walked down a tiny alleyway, which had once been part of a Victorian ""rookery""-a slum comprised in equal parts of theft and penny gin, of twopenny-halfpenny squalor and threepenny sex-and they heard it, snuffling and snorting somewhere nearby. And then it bellowed, deep and dark. Mr. Croup hesitated, before hurrying forward, up a short wooden staircase; and then, at the end of the alley, he stopped, squinting about him, before he led them down some steps into a long stone tunnel that had once run across the Fleet Marshes, in the Templars' time. Door said, ""You're afraid, aren't you?"" Croup glared at her. ""Hush your tongue."" She smiled, although she did not feel like smiling. ""You're scared that your safe-conduct token won't get you past the Beast. What are you planning now? To kidnap Islington? Sell both of us to the highest bidder?""""Quiet,"" said Mr. Vandemar. But Mr. Croup simply chuckled; and Door knew then that the Angel Islington was not her friend.She began to shout. ""Hey! Beast! Here!"" Mr. Vandemar cuffed her head and knocked her against the wall. ""Said to be quiet,"" he told her, calmly. She tasted blood in her mouth and spat scarlet on the mud. Then she parted her lips to begin shouting once more. Mr. Vandemar, anticipating this, had taken a handkerchief from his pocket, and he forced it into her mouth. She tried to bite his thumb as he did so, but it made no appreciable impression on him.""Now you'll be quiet,"" he told her. Mr. Vandemar was very proud of his handkerchief, which was spattered with green and brown and black and had originally belonged to an overweight snuff dealer in the 1820s, who had died of apoplexy and been buried with his handkerchief in his pocket. Mr. Vandemar still occasionally found fragments of snuff merchant in it, but it was, he felt, a fine handkerchief for all that. They continued in silence.Richard made another entry in his mental diary. Today, he thought, I've survived walking the plank, the kiss of death, and a lecture on inflicting pain. Right now, I'm on my way through a labyrinth with a mad bastard who came back from the dead and a bodyguard who turned out to be a . . . whatever the opposite of a bodyguard is. I am so far out of my depth that . . . Metaphors failed him, then. He had gone beyond the world of metaphor and simile into the place of things that are, and it was changing him.They were wading through a narrow passage of wet, marshy ground, between dark stone walls. The marquis held both the token and the crossbow, and he took care to walk, at all times, about ten feet behind Hunter. Richard, in the lead, was carrying Hunter's Beast spear and a yellow flare the marquis had produced from beneath his blanket, which illuminated the stone walls and the mud, and he walked well in front of Hunter. The marshland stank, and huge mosquitoes had begun to settle upon Richard's arms and legs and face, biting him painfully and raising huge, itching welts. Neither Hunter nor the marquis so much as mentioned the mosquitoes.Richard was beginning to suspect that they were quite lost. It did not help his mood any that there were a large number of dead people in the marsh: leathery preserved bodies, discolored skeletal bones, and pallid, water-swollen corpses. He wondered how long the corpses had been there, and whether they had been killed by the Beast or by the mosquitoes. He said nothing as they walked on for another five minutes and eleven mosquito bites, and then he called out, ""I think we're lost. We've been through this way before.""The marquis held up the token. ""No. We're fine,"" he said. ""The token is leading us straight. Clever little thing.""""Yeah,"" said Richard, who was not impressed. ""Very clever.""It was then that the marquis stepped, barefoot, on the shattered rib cage of a half-buried corpse, puncturing his heel, and causing him to stumble. The little black statue went flying through the air and tumbled into the black marsh with the satisfied plop of a leaping fish returning to the water. The marquis righted himself and pointed the crossbow at Hunter's back.""Richard,"" he called. ""I dropped it. Can you come back here?"" Richard walked back, holding the flare high, hoping for the glint of flame on obsidian, seeing nothing but wet mud. ""Get down into the mud and look,"" said the marquis.Richard groaned.""You've dreamed of the Beast, Richard,"" said the marquis. ""Do you really want to encounter it?""Richard thought about this for not very long, then he pushed the haft of the bronze spear into the surface of the marsh and stood the flare up into the mud beside it, illuminating the surface of the marsh with a fitful amber light. He got down on his hands and knees in the bog, searching for the statue. He ran his hands over the surface of the marsh, hoping not to encounter any dead faces or hands. ""It's hopeless. It could be anywhere.""""Keep looking,"" said the marquis.Richard tried to remember how he usually found things. First he let his mind go as blank as he could, then he let his gaze wander over the surface of the marsh, purposelessly, idly. Something glittered on the boggy surface, five feet to his left. It was the Beast statue. ""I can see it,"" called Richard.He floundered toward it through the mud. The little glassy beast was head-down in a puddle of dark water. Perhaps the mud was disturbed by Richard's approach; more likely, as Richard was convinced forever after, it was just the sheer cussedness of the material world. Whatever the cause, he was almost next to the little statue when the marsh made a noise that sounded like a giant stomach rumbling, and a large bubble of gas floated up and popped noxiously and obscenely beside the talisman, which vanished beneath the water.Richard reached the place where the talisman had been and pushed his arms deep into the mud, searching for it wildly, not caring what else his fingers might encounter. It was no use. It was gone forever. ""What do we do now?"" asked Richard.The marquis sighed. ""Get back over here, and we'll figure out something.""Richard said, quietly, ""Too late.""It was coming toward them so slowly, so ponderously that he thought for a fragment of a second that it was old, sick, even dying. That was his first thought. And then he realized how much ground it was covering as it approached, mud and foul water splashing up from its hooves as it ran, and he realized how wrong he had been in thinking it slow. Thirty feet away from them the Beast slowed, and stopped, with a grunt. Its flanks were steaming. It bellowed, in triumph, and in challenge. There were broken spears, and shattered swords, and rusted knives, bristling from its sides and back. The yellow flare light glinted in its red eyes, and on its tusks, and its hooves.It lowered its massive head. It was some kind of boar, thought Richard, and then realized that that had to be nonsense: no boar could be so huge. It was the size of an ox, of a bull elephant, of a lifetime. It stared at them, and it paused for a hundred years, which transpired in a dozen heartbeats.Hunter knelt, in one fluid motion, and pulled up the spear from the Fleet Marsh, which released it with a sucking noise. And, in a voice that was pure joy, she said, ""Yes. At last.""She had forgotten them all; forgotten Richard down in the mud, and the marquis and his foolish crossbow, and the world. She was delighted and transported, in a perfect place, the world she lived for. Her world contained two things: Hunter, and the Beast. The Beast knew that too. It was the perfect match, the hunter and the hunted. And who was who, and which was which, only time would reveal; time and the dance.The Beast charged.Hunter waited until she could see the white spittle dripping from its mouth, and as it lowered its head she stabbed up with the spear; but, as she tried to sink the spear into its side, she understood that she had moved just a fraction of a second too late, and the spear went tumbling out of her numbed hands, and a tusk sharper than the sharpest razor blade opened her side. And as she fell beneath its monstrous weight, she felt its sharp hooves crushing down on her arm, and her hip, and her ribs. And then it was gone, vanished back into the darkness, and the dance was done.Mr. Croup was more relieved than he would have admitted to be through the labyrinth. But he and Mr. Vandemar were through it, unharmed, as was their prey. There was a rock face in front of them, an oaken double door set in the rock face, and an oval mirror set in the right-hand door.Mr. Croup touched the mirror with one grimy hand. The surface of the mirror clouded at his touch, seethed for a moment, bubbling and roiling like a vat of boiling quicksilver, and then was still. The Angel Islington looked out at them. Mr. Croup cleared his throat. ""Good morning, sir. It is us, and we have the young lady you sent us to fetch for you.""""And the key?"" The angel's gentle voice seemed to come from all around them.""Hanging around her swanlike neck,"" said Mr. Croup, a little more anxiously than he intended to.""Then enter,"" said the angel. The oak doors swung open at his words, and they went in.It had all happened so fast. The Beast had come out of the darkness, Hunter had snatched the spear, and it had charged her and disappeared back into the darkness.Richard strained to hear the Beast. He could hear nothing but, somewhere close to him, the slow drip, drip of water, and the high, maddening whine of mosquitoes. Hunter lay on her back in the mud. One arm was twisted at a peculiar angle. He crawled toward her, through the mire. ""Hunter?"" he whispered. ""Can you hear me?""There was a pause. And then, a whisper so faint he thought for a moment he had imagined it, ""Yes.""The marquis was still some yards away, standing stock-still beside a wall. Now he called out, ""Richard-stay where you are. The creature's just biding its time. It'll be back.""Richard ignored him. He spoke to Hunter. ""Are you . . . "" he paused. It seemed such a stupid thing to say. He said it anyway. ""Are you going to be all right?"" She laughed, then, with blood-flecked lips, and shook her head. ""Are there any medical people down here?"" he asked the marquis.""Not in the sense you're thinking of. We have some healers, a handful of leeches and chirurgeons . . . ""Hunter coughed, then, and winced. Bright red, arterial blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. The marquis edged a little closer. ""Do you keep your life hidden anywhere, Hunter?"" he asked.""I'm a hunter,"" she whispered, disdainfully. ""We don't go in for that kind of thing . . . "" She pulled air into her lungs with an effort, then exhaled, as if the simple effort of breathing were becoming too much for her. ""Richard, have you ever used a spear?""""No.""""Take it,"" she whispered.""But . . . """"Do it."" Her voice was low and urgent. ""Pick it up. Hold it at the blunt end.""Richard picked up the fallen spear. He held it at the blunt end. ""I knew that part,"" he told her.A glimmer of a smile breathed across her face. ""I know.""""Look,"" said Richard, feeling, not for the first time, like the only sane person in a madhouse. ""Why don't we just stay very quiet. Maybe it'll go away. We'll try to get you some help."" And, not for the first time, the person he was talking to ignored him utterly.""I did a bad thing, Richard Mayhew,"" she whispered, sadly. ""I did a very bad thing. Because I wanted to be the one to kill the Beast. Because I needed the spear."" And then, impossibly, she began to haul herself to her feet. Richard had not realized how badly she had been injured; nor could he now imagine what pain she must be in: he could see her right arm hanging uselessly, a white shard of bone protruding horribly from the skin. Blood ran from a cut in her side. Her rib cage looked wrong.""Stop it,"" he hissed, futilely. ""Get down.""With her left hand she pulled a knife from her belt, put it into her right hand, closed the nerveless fingers around the hilt. ""I did a bad thing,"" she repeated. ""And now I make amends.""She began humming, then. Humming high and humming low, until she found the note that made the walls and the pipes and the room reverberate, and she hummed that note until it felt like the entire labyrinth must be echoing to her hum. And then, sucking the air into her shattered rib cage, she shouted, ""Hey. Big boy? Where are you?"" There came no reply. No noise but the low drip of water. Even the mosquitoes were quiet.""Maybe it's . . . gone away,"" said Richard, gripping the spear so tightly that it hurt his hands.""I doubt it,"" muttered the marquis.""Come on, you bastard,"" Hunter screamed. ""Are you scared?""There was a deep bellow from off front of them, and the Beast came out of the dark, and it charged once more. This time there could be no room for mistakes. ""The dance,"" whispered Hunter. ""The dance is not yet over.""As the Beast came toward her, its horns lowered, she shouted, ""Now-Richard. Strike! Under and up! Now!"" before the Beast hit her and her words turned into a wordless scream.Richard saw the Beast come out from the darkness, into the light of the flare. It all happened very slowly. It was like a dream. It was like all his dreams. The Beast was so close he could smell the shit-and-blood animal stench of it, so close he could feel its warmth. And Richard stabbed with the spear, as hard as he could, pushing up into its side and letting it sink in.A bellow, then, or a roar, of anguish, and hatred, and pain. And then silence.He could hear his heart, thudding in his ears, and he could hear water dripping. The mosquitoes began to whine once more. He realized he was still holding tight to the haft of the spear, although the blade of it was buried deep within the body of the immobile Beast. He let go of it, and staggered around the beast, looking for Hunter. She was trapped beneath the Beast. It occurred to him that if he moved her, pulling her out from under it, he might cause her death, so instead he pushed, as hard as he could, against the warm dead flanks of the Beast, trying to move it. It was like trying to push-start a Sherman tank, but eventually, awkwardly, he tumbled it half-off her.Hunter lay on her back, staring up at the darkness above them. Her eyes were open, and unfocussed, and Richard knew, somehow, that they saw nothing at all. ""Hunter?"" he said.""I'm still here, Richard Mayhew."" Her voice sounded almost detached. She made no effort to find him with her eyes, no effort to focus. ""Is it dead?""""I think so. It's not moving.""And then she laughed; it was a strange sort of laugh, as if she had just heard the funniest joke that ever the world told a hunter. And, between her spasms of laughter, and the wet, racking coughs that interrupted them, she shared the joke with him. ""You killed the Beast,"" she said. ""So now you're the greatest hunter in London Below. The Warrior . . . "" And then she stopped laughing. ""I can't feel my hands. Take my right hand."" Richard fumbled under the Beast's body, and wrapped his hand around Hunter's chill fingers. They felt so small, suddenly. ""Is there still a knife in my hand?"" she whispered.""Yes."" He could feel it, cold and sticky.""Take the knife. She's yours.""""I don't want your . . . """"Take her."" He pried the knife free from her fingers. ""She's yours now,"" whispered Hunter. Nothing was moving, save her lips; and her eyes were clouding. ""She's always looked after me. Clean my blood off her, though . . . mustn't rust the blade . . . a hunter always looks after her weapons."" She gulped air. ""Now . . . touch the Beast's blood . . . to your eyes and tongue . . . ""Richard was not sure that he had heard her correctly, nor that he believed what he had heard. ""What?""Richard had not noticed the marquis approach, but now he spoke intently into Richard's ear. ""Do it, Richard. She's right. It'll get you through the labyrinth. Do it.""Richard put his hand down to the spear, ran it up the haft until he felt the Beast's hide and the warm stickiness of the Beast's blood. Feeling slightly foolish, he touched his hand to his tongue, tasting the salt of the creature's blood: it did not, to his surprise, revolt him. It tasted utterly natural, like tasting an ocean. He touched his bloody fingers to his eyes, where the blood stung like sweat.Then, ""I did it,"" he told her.""That's good,"" whispered Hunter. She said nothing more.The marquis de Carabas reached out his hand and closed her eyes. Richard wiped Hunter's knife on his shirt. It was what she had told him to do. It saved having to think.""Better get a move on,"" said the marquis, standing up.""We can't just leave her here.""""We can. We can come back for the body later.""Richard polished the blade as hard as he could on his shirt. He was crying, now, but he had not noticed. ""And if there isn't any later?""""Then we'll just have to hope that someone disposes of all our remains. Including the Lady Door's. And she must be getting tired of waiting for us."" Richard looked down. He wiped the last of Hunter's blood off her knife, and put it through his belt. Then he nodded. ""You go,"" said de Carabas. ""I'll follow as fast as I can.""Richard hesitated; and then, as best he could, he ran.Perhaps it was the Beast's blood that did it; he certainly had no other explanation. Whatever the reason, he ran straight and true through the labyrinth, which no longer held any mysteries for him. He felt that he knew every twist, every path, every alley and lane and runnel of it. He ran, stumbling and falling, and still running, exhausted, through the labyrinth, his blood pounding in his temples. A rhyme coursed through his head, as he ran, pounding and echoing to the rhythm of his feet. It was something he had heard as a child.This aye night, this aye night Every night and all Fire and fleet and candlelight And Christ receive thy soul.The words went around and around, dirgelike, in his head. Fire and fleet and candlelight . . .At the end of the labyrinth was a sheer granite cliff, and set in the cliff were high wooden double doors. There was an oval mirror hanging on one of the doors. The doors were closed. He touched the wood, and the door opened, silently, to his touch.Richard went inside.
NW_ch17	NW	Neverwhere	17	4053	23072	NeverwhereSEVENTEENRichard followed the path between the burning candles, which led him through the angel's vault to the Great Hall. He recognized his surroundings: this was where they had drunk Islington's wine: an octagon of iron pillars supporting the stone roof above them, the huge black stone and metal door, the old wooden table, the candles.Door was chained up, spread-eagled between two pillars beside the flint and silver door. She stared at him as he came in, her odd-colored pixie eyes wide and scared. The Angel Islington, standing beside her, turned and smiled at Richard as he entered. That was the most chilling thing of all: the gentle compassion, the sweetness of that smile.""Come in, Richard Mayhew. Come in,"" said the Angel Islington. ""Dear me. You do look a mess."" There was honest concern in its voice. Richard hesitated. ""Please."" The angel gestured, curling a white forefinger, urging him further in. ""I think we all know each other. You know the Lady Door, of course, and my associates, Mister Croup, Mister Vandemar."" Richard turned. Croup and Vandemar were standing on each side of him. Mr. Vandemar smiled at him. Mr. Croup did not. ""I was hoping you would show up,"" continued the angel. It tipped its head on one side, and asked, ""By the bye, where is Hunter?""""She's dead,"" said Richard. He heard Door gasp.""Oh. The poor dear,"" said Islington. It shook its head sadly, obviously regretting the senseless loss of human life, the frailty of all mortals born to suffer and to die.""Still,"" said Mr. Croup chirpily. ""Can't make an omelette without killing a few people.""Richard ignored them, as best he could. ""Door? Are you all right?""""More or less, thanks. So far."" Her lower lip was swollen, and there was a bruise on her cheek.""I am afraid,"" said Islington, ""that Miss Door was proving a little intransigent. I was just discussing having Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar . . . "" It paused. There were obviously some things it found distasteful actually to say.""Torture her,"" suggested Mr. Vandemar, helpfully.""We are,"" said Mr. Croup, ""after all, famed across the entirety of creation for our skill in the excrutiatory arts.""""Good at hurting people,"" clarified Mr. Vandemar.The angel continued, staring intently at Richard as it spoke, as if it had heard neither of them. ""But then, Miss Door does not strike me as someone who will easily change her mind.""""Give us time enough,"" said Mr. Croup. ""We'd break her.""""Into little wet pieces,"" said Mr. Vandemar.Islington shook his head and smiled indulgently at this display of enthusiasm. ""No time,"" it said to Richard, ""no time. However, she does strike me as someone who would indeed act to end the pain and suffering of a friend, a fellow mortal, such as yourself, Richard . . . "" Mr. Croup hit Richard in the stomach, then: a vicious rabbit punch to the gut, and Richard doubled up. He felt Mr. Vandemar's fingers on the back of his neck, pulling him back to a standing position.""But it's wrong,"" said Door.Islington looked thoughtful. ""Wrong?"" it said, puzzled and amused.Mr. Croup pulled Richard's head close to his, and smiled his graveyard smile. ""He's traveled so far beyond right and wrong he couldn't see them with a telescope on a nice clear night,"" he confided. ""Now Mister Vandemar, if you'll do the honors?""Mr. Vandemar took Richard's left hand in his. He took Richard's little finger between his huge fingers and bent it back until it broke. Richard cried out.The angel turned, slowly. It seemed distracted by something. It blinked its pearl gray eyes. ""There's someone else out there. Mister Croup?"" There was a dark shimmer where Mr. Croup had been, and he was there no longer.The marquis de Carabas was flattened against the side of the red granite cliff, staring at the oak doors that led into Islington's dwelling.Plans and plots whirled through his head, each scheme fizzling out uselessly as he imagined it. He had thought he would have known what to do when he got to this point, and he was discovering, to his disgust, that he had absolutely no idea. There were no more favors to call in, no levers to press or buttons to push, so he scrutinized the doors and wondered whether they were guarded, whether the angel would know if they were opened. There had to be an obvious solution he was missing, if only he thought hard enough: perhaps something would occur to him. At least, he thought, slightly cheered, he had surprise on his side.That was until he felt the cold point of a sharp knife placed against his throat, and he heard Mr. Croup's oily voice whispering in his ear. ""I already killed you once today,"" it was saying. ""What does it take to teach some people?""Richard was manacled and chained between a pair of iron pillars when Mr. Croup returned, prodding the marquis de Carabas with his knife. The angel looked at the marquis, with disappointment on its face, then, gently, it shook its beautiful head. ""You told me he was dead,"" it said.""He is,"" said Mr. Vandemar.""He was,"" corrected Mr. Croup.The angel's voice was a fraction less gentle and less caring. ""I will not be lied to,"" it said.""We don't lie,"" said Mr. Croup, affronted.""Do,"" said Mr. Vandemar.Mr. Croup ran a grimy hand through his filthy orange hair, in exasperation. ""Indeed we do. But not this time.""The pain in Richard's hand showed no indication of subsiding. ""How can you behave like this?"" he asked, angrily. ""You're an angel.""""What did I tell you, Richard?"" asked the marquis, drily.Richard thought. ""You said, Lucifer was an angel.""Islington smiled superciliously. ""Lucifer?"" it said. ""Lucifer was an idiot. It wound up lord and master of nothing at all.""The marquis grinned. ""And you wound up lord and master of two thugs and a roomful of candles?""The angel licked its lips. ""They told me it was my punishment for Atlantis. I told them there was nothing more I could have done. The whole affair was . . . "" it paused, as if it were hunting for the correct word. And then it said, with regret, ""Unfortunate.""""But millions of people were killed,"" said Door.Islington clasped its hands in front of its chest, as if it were posing for a Christmas card. ""These things happen,"" it explained, reasonably.""Of course they do,"" said the marquis, mildly, the irony implicit in his words, not in his voice. ""Cities sink every day. And you had nothing to do with it?""It was as if the lid had been pulled off something dark and writhing: a place of derangement and fury and utter viciousness; and, in a time of scary things, it was the most frightening thing Richard had seen. The angel's serene beauty cracked; its eyes flashed; and it screamed at them, crazy-scary and uncontrolled, utterly certain in its righteousness, ""They deserved it.""There was a moment of silence. And then the angel lowered its head, and sighed, and raised its head, and said, very quietly and with deep regret, ""Just one of those things."" Then it pointed to the marquis. ""Chain him up,"" it said.Croup and Vandemar fastened manacles around the marquis's wrists, and chained the manacles securely to the pillars beside Richard. The angel had turned its attention back to Door. It walked over to her, reached out its hand, placed it beneath her pointed chin, and raised her head, to stare into her eyes. ""Your family,"" it said, gently. ""You come from a very unusual family. Quite remarkable.""""Then why did you have us killed?""""Not all of you,"" it said. Richard thought it was talking about Door, but then it said, ""There was always the possibility that you might not have . . . worked out as well as you did."" It released her chin and stroked her face with long, white fingers, and it said, ""Your family can open doors. They can create doors where there were no doors. They can unlock doors that are locked. Open doors that were never meant to be opened."" It ran its fingers down her neck, gently, as if it were caressing her, then closed its hand on the key about her neck. ""When I was sentenced here, they gave me the door to my prison. And they took the key to the door, and put it down here too. An exquisite form of torture."" It tugged, gently, on the chain, pulling it out from under Door's layers of silk and cotton and lace, revealing the silver key; and then it ran its fingers over the key, as if it were exploring her secret places.Richard knew, then. ""The Black Friars were keeping the key safe from you,"" he said.Islington let go of the key. Door was chained up beside the door made of black flint and tarnished silver. The angel walked to it, and placed a hand on it, white against the blackness of the door. ""From me,"" agreed Islington. ""A key. A door. An opener of the door. There must be the three, you see: a particularly refined sort of joke. The idea being that when they decided I had earned forgiveness and my freedom, they would send me an opener, and give me the key. I just decided to take matters into my own hands, and will be leaving a little early.""It turned back to Door. Once more it caressed the key. Then it closed its hand about the key and tugged, hard. The chain snapped. Door winced. ""I spoke first to your father, Door,"" the angel continued. ""He worried about the Underside. He wanted to unite London Below, to unite the baronies and fiefdoms-perhaps even to forge some kind of bond with London Above. I told him I would help him, if he would help me. Then I told him the nature of the help I needed, and he laughed at me."" It repeated the words, as if it still found them impossible to believe. ""He laughed. At me.""Door shook her head. ""You killed him because he turned you down?""""I didn't kill him,"" Islington corrected her, gently. ""I had him killed.""""But he told me I could trust you. He told me to come here. In his journal.""Mr. Croup began to giggle. ""He didn't,"" he said. ""He never did. That was us. What was it he actually said, Mister Vandemar?""""Door, child, fear Islington,"" said Mr. Vandemar, with her father's voice. The voice was exact. ""Islington's got to be behind all this. It's dangerous, Door- keep away from it-""Islington caressed her cheek, with the key. ""I thought my version would get you here a little faster.""""We took the journal,"" said Mr. Croup. ""We fixed it, and we returned it.""""Where does the door lead to?"" called Richard.""Home,"" said the angel.""Heaven?""And Islington said nothing, but it smiled.""So, you figure they won't notice you're back?"" sneered the marquis. ""Just, 'Oh look, there's another angel, here, grab a harp and on with the hosannas'?""Islington's gray eyes were bright. ""Not for me the smooth agonies of adulation, of hymns and halos and self-satisfied prayers,"" it said. ""I have . . . my own agenda.""""Well, now you've got the key,"" said Door.""And I have you,"" said the angel. ""You're the opener. Without you the key is useless. Open the door for me.""""You killed her family,"" said Richard. ""You've had her hunted through London Below. Now you want her to open a door for you so you can single-handedly invade Heaven? You're not much of a judge of character, are you? She'll never do it.""The angel looked at him then, with eyes older than the Milky Way. Then it said, ""Ah me,"" and turned its back, as if it were ill-prepared to watch the unpleasantness that was about to occur.""Hurt him some more, Mister Vandemar,"" said Mr. Croup. ""Cut off his ear.""Mr. Vandemar raised his hand. It was empty. He jerked his arm, almost imperceptibly, and now he was holding a knife. ""Told you one day you'd find out what your own liver tastes like,"" he said to Richard. ""Today's going to be your lucky day."" He slid the knife blade gently beneath Richard's earlobe. Richard felt no pain-perhaps, he thought, he had felt too much pain already that day, perhaps the blade was too sharp to hurt. But he felt the warm blood drip, wetly, from his ear down his neck. Door was watching him, and her elfin face and huge opal-colored eyes filled his vision. He tried to send her mental messages. Hold out. Don't let them make you do this. I'll be fine. Then Mr. Vandemar put a little pressure on the knife, and Richard bit back a scream. He tried to stop his face from grimacing, but another jab from the blade jerked a grimace and a moan from him.""Stop them,"" said Door. ""I'll open your door.""Islington gestured, curtly, and Mr. Vandemar sighed piteously and put his knife away. The warm blood dripped down Richard's neck and pooled and puddled in the hollow of his clavicle. Mr. Croup walked over to Door and unlocked the right-hand manacle. She stood there, rubbing her wrist, framed by the pillars. She was still chained to the pillar on the left, but she now had a certain amount of freedom of movement. She put her hand out for the key. ""Remember,"" said Islington. ""I have your friends.""Door looked at him with utter contempt, every inch Lord Portico's oldest daughter. ""Give me the key,"" she said. The angel passed her the silver key.""Door,"" called Richard. ""Don't do it. Don't set it free. We don't matter.""""Actually,"" said the marquis, ""I matter very much. But I have to agree. Don't do it.""She looked from Richard to the marquis, her eyes lingering on their manacled hands, on the heavy chains that bound them to the black iron pillars. She looked very vulnerable; and then she turned away, and walked to the limit of her own chain, until she stood in front of the black door made of flint and tarnished silver. There was no keyhole. She put the palm of her right hand on the door, and closed her eyes, let the door tell her where it opened, what it could do, finding those places inside herself that corresponded with the door. When she pulled her hand away, there was a keyhole that had not been there before. A white light lanced out from behind the keyhole, sharp and bright as a laser in the candlelit darkness of the hall.The girl pushed the silver key into the keyhole. There was a pause, and then she turned it in the lock. Something went click, and there was a chiming noise, and suddenly the door was framed in light. ""When I am gone,"" said the angel, very quietly, to Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, with charm, and with kindness, and with compassion, ""kill them all, howsoever, you wish."" It turned back to the door, which Door was pulling open: it was opening slowly, as if there was great resistance. She was sweating.""So your employer's leaving,"" said the marquis to Mr. Croup. ""I hope you've both been paid in full.""Croup peered at the marquis, and said, ""What?""""Well,"" said Richard, wondering what the marquis was trying to do, but willing to play along, ""you don't think you're ever going to see him again, do you?""Mr. Vandemar blinked, slowly, like an antique camera, and said, ""What?""Mr. Croup scratched his chin. ""The corpses-to-be have a point,"" he said to Mr. Vandemar. He walked toward the angel, who stood, arms folded, in front of the door. ""Sir? It might be wise for you to settle up, before you commence the next stage of your travels.""The angel turned, and looked down at him as if he were less important than the least speck of dirt. Then it turned away. Richard wondered what it was contemplating. ""It is of no matter now,"" said the angel. ""Soon, all the rewards your revolting little minds can conceive of will be yours. When I have my throne.""""Jam tomorrow, eh?"" said Richard.""Don't like jam,"" said Mr. Vandemar. ""Makes me belch.""Mr. Croup waggled a finger at Mr. Vandemar, ""He's welching out on us,"" he said. ""You don't welch on Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar, me bucko. We collect our debts.""Mr. Vandemar walked over to where Mr. Croup was standing. ""In full,"" he said.""With interest,"" barked Mr. Croup.""And meat hooks,"" said Mr. Vandemar""From Heaven?"" called Richard, from behind them. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar walked toward the contemplative angel. ""Hey!"" said Mr. Croup.The door had opened, only a crack, but it was open. Light flooded through the crack in the door. The angel took a step forward. It was as if it were dreaming with its eyes wide open. The light from the crack in the door bathed its face, and it drank it in like wine. ""Have no fear,"" it said. ""For when the vastness of creation is mine, and they gather about my throne to sing hosannas to my name, I shall reward the worthy and cast down those who are hateful in my sight.""With an effort, Door wrenched the black door fully open. The view through the door was blinding in its intensity: a swirling maelstrom of color and light. Richard squinted his eyes, and turned his head away from the glare, all vicious orange and retinal purple. Is that what Heaven looks like? It seems more like Hell.And then he felt the wind. A candle flew past his head, and vanished through the door. And then another. And then the air was filled with candles, all spinning and tumbling through the air, heading for the light. If was as if the whole room were being sucked through the door. It was more than a wind, though. Richard knew that. His wrists began to hurt where they were manacled-it was as if, suddenly, he weighed twice as much as he ever had before. And then his perspective changed. The view through the doorway- it was looking down: it was not merely the wind that was pulling everything toward the door. It was gravity. The wind was only the air in the hall being sucked into the place on the other side of the door. He wondered what was on the other side of the door-the surface of a star, perhaps, or the event horizon of a black hole, or something he could not even imagine.Islington grabbed hold of the pillar beside the door, and held on desperately. ""That's not Heaven,"" it shouted, gray eyes flashing, spittle on its perfect lips. ""You mad little witch. What have you done?""Door was clutching the chains that held her to the black pillar, white-knuckled. There was triumph in her eyes. Mr. Vandemar had caught hold of a table leg, while Mr. Croup, in his turn, had caught hold of Mr. Vandemar. ""It wasn't the real key,"" said Door, triumphantly, over the roar of the wind. ""That was just a copy of the key I had Hammersmith make in the market.""""But it opened the door,"" screamed the angel.""No,"" said the girl with the opal eyes, distantly. ""I opened a door. As far and hard away as I could, I opened a door.""There was no longer any trace of kindness or compassion on the angel's face; only hatred, pure and honest and cold. ""I will kill you,"" it told her.""Like you killed my family? I don't think you're going to kill anyone anymore.""The angel was hanging onto the pillar with pale fingers, but its body was at a ninety-degree angle to the room, and was most of the way through the door. It looked both comical and dreadful. It licked its lips. ""Stop it,"" it pleaded. ""Close the door. I'll tell you where your sister is . . . She's still alive . . . "" Door flinched.And Islington was sucked through the door, a tiny, plummeting figure, shrinking as it tumbled into the blinding gulf beyond. The pull was getting stronger. Richard prayed that his chains and manacles would hold: he could feel himself being sucked toward the opening, and, from the corner of his eye, he could see the marquis dangling from his chains, like a string-puppet being sucked up by a vacuum cleaner.The table, the leg of which Mr. Vandemar was holding tightly, flew through the air and jammed in the open doorway. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were dangling out of the door. Mr. Croup, who was clinging, quite literally, to Mr. Vandemar's coattails, took a deep breath and began slowly to clamber, hand over hand, up Mr. Vandemar's back. The table creaked. Mr. Croup looked at Door, and he smiled like a fox. ""I killed your family,"" said Mr. Croup. ""Not him. And now I'm-finally-going to finish the . . . ""It was at that moment that the fabric of Mr. Vandemar's dark suit gave way. Mr. Croup tumbled, screaming, into the void, clutching a long strip of black material. Mr. Vandemar looked down at the flailing figure of Mr. Croup as it fell away from them. He, too, looked over at Door, but there was no menace in his gaze. He shrugged, as best as one can shrug while holding on to a table leg for dear life, and then he said, mildly, ""Bye-bye,"" and let go of the table leg.Silently he plunged through the door, into the light, shrinking as he fell, heading for the tiny figure of Mr. Croup. Soon the two shapes merged into one little blob of blackness in a sea of churning purple and white and orange light, and then the black dot, too, was gone. It made some sort of sense, Richard thought: they were a team, after all.It was getting harder to breathe. Richard felt giddy and light-headed. The table in the doorway splintered and was sucked away through the door. One of Richard's manacles popped open, and his right arm whipped free. He grabbed the chain holding the left hand, and gripped it as tightly as he could, grateful that the broken finger was on the hand that was still in the manacle; even so, red and blue flashes of pain were shooting up his left arm. He could hear himself, distantly, shouting in pain.He could not breathe. White blotches of light exploded behind his eyes. He could feel the chain beginning to give way . . .The sound of the black door slamming closed filled his whole world. Richard fell violently back against the cold iron pillar, and slumped to the floor. There was silence, then, in the hall-silence, and utter darkness, in the Great Hall under the earth. Richard closed his eyes: it made no difference to the darkness, and he opened his eyes once more.The hush was broken by the marquis's voice, asking, drily, ""So where did you send them?"" And then Richard heard a girl's voice talking. He knew it had to be Door's, but it sounded so young, like the voice of a tiny child at bedtime, at the end of a long and exhausting day. ""I don't know . . . a long way away. I'm . . . very tired now. I . . . """"Door,"" said the marquis. ""Snap out of it."" it was good that he was saying it, thought Richard, somebody had to, and Richard could no longer remember how to talk. There was a click, then, in the darkness: the sound of a manacle opening, followed by the sound of chains falling against a metal pillar. Then the sound of a match being struck. A candle was lit: it burned weakly, and flickered in the thin air. Fire and fleet and candlelight, thought Richard, and he could not remember why.Door walked, unsteadily, to the marquis, holding her candle. She reached out a hand, touched his chains, and his manacles clicked open. He rubbed his wrists. Then she walked over to Richard, and touched his single remaining manacle. It fell open. Door sighed, then, and sat down beside him. He reached out his good arm and cradled her head, holding her close to him. He rocked her slowly back and forth, crooning a wordless lullaby. It was cold, cold, there in the angel's empty hall; but soon the warmth of unconsciousness reached out and enveloped them both.The marquis de Carabas watched the sleeping children. The idea of sleep-of returning, even for a short time, to a state so horribly close to death-scared him more than he would have ever believed. But, eventually, even he put his head down on his arm, and closed his eyes.And then there were none.
NW_ch18	NW	Neverwhere	18	324	1913	NeverwhereEIGHTEENThe Lady Serpentine, who was, but for Olympia, the oldest of the Seven Sisters, walked through the labyrinth beyond Down Street, her head held high, her white leather boots squashing through the dank mud. This was, after all, the furthest she had been from her house in over a hundred years. Her wasp-waisted majordomo, dressed from head to foot all in black leather, walked ahead of her, holding a large carriage-lamp. Two of Serpentine's other women, similarly dressed, walked behind her at a respectful distance.The ripped lace train of Serpentine's dress dragged in the mire behind her, but she paid it no mind. She saw something glinting in the lamplight ahead of them, and, beside it, a dark and bulky shape.""There it is,"" she said.The two women who had been walking, behind her hurried forward, splashing through the marsh, and as Serpentine's butler approached, bringing with her a swinging circle of warm light, the shape resolved into objects. The light had been glinting from a long bronze spear. Hunter's body, twisted and bloody and wretched, lay on its back, half-buried in the mud, in a large pool of scarlet gore, its legs trapped beneath the body of an enormous boar-like creature. Her eyes were closed.Serpentine's women hauled the body out from under the Beast, and lay it in the mud. Serpentine knelt in the wet mire and ran one finger down Hunter's cold cheek, until it reached her blood-blackened lips, where she let it linger for some moments. Then she stood up. ""Bring the spear,"" said Serpentine.One of the women picked up Hunter's body; the other pulled the spear from the carcass of the Beast and put it over her shoulder. And then the four figures turned, and went back the way they had come; a silent procession deep beneath the world. The lamplight flickered on Serpentine's ravaged face as she walked; but it revealed no emotion of any kind, neither happy nor sad.
NW_ch19	NW	Neverwhere	19	3810	21701	NeverwhereNINETEENFor a moment, upon waking, he had NO idea at all who he was. It was a tremendously liberating feeling, as if he were free to be whatever he wanted to be: he could be anyone at all-able to try on any identity; he could be a man or a woman, a rat or a bird, a monster or a god. And then someone made a rustling noise, and he woke up the rest of the way, and in waking he found that he was Richard Mayhew, whoever that was, whatever that meant. He was Richard Mayhew, and he did not know where he was.There was crisp linen pressed against his face. He hurt all over; in some places-the little finger on his left hand, for example-more than others.Someone was nearby. Richard could hear breathing, and the hesitant rustling noises of a person in the same room he was in, trying to be discreet. Richard raised his head, and discovered, in the raising, more places that hurt. Some of them hurt very badly. Far away-rooms and rooms away-people were singing. The song was so distant and quiet he knew he would lose it if he opened, his eyes: a deep, melodious chanting . . .He opened his eyes. The room was small, and dimly lit. He was on a low bed, and the rustling sound he had heard was made by a cowled figure in a black robe, with his back to Richard. The black figure was dusting the room, with an incongruously brightly colored feather duster. ""Where am I?"" asked Richard.The black figure nearly dropped its feather duster, then it turned, revealing a very nervous, thin, dark brown face. ""Would you like some water?"" the Black Friar asked, in the manner of one who has been told that if the patient wakes up, he is to be asked if he would like some water, and has been repeating it to himself over and over for the last forty minutes to make sure that he didn't forget.""I . . . "" and Richard realized that he was most dreadfully thirsty. He sat up in the bed. ""Yes, I would. Thank you very much."" The friar poured some water from a battered metal jug into a battered metal cup and passed it to Richard. Richard sipped the water slowly, restraining the impulse to gulp it down. It was crystal cold and clear and tasted like diamonds and ice.Richard looked down at himself. His clothes were gone. He had been dressed in a long robe, like one of the Black Friars' habits, but gray. His broken finger had been splinted and neatly bandaged. He raised a finger to his ear; there was a bandage on it, and what felt like stitches beneath the bandage. ""You're one of the Black Friars,"" said Richard.""Yes, sir.""""How did I get here? Where are my friends?""The friar pointed to the corridor, wordlessly and nervously. Richard got out of the bed. He checked under his gray robe: he was naked. His torso and legs were covered in a variety of deep indigo and purple bruises, all of which seemed to have been rubbed with some kind of ointment: it smelt like cough syrup and buttered toast. His right knee was bandaged. He wondered where his clothes were. There were sandals beside the bed, and he put them on, then he walked out into the corridor. The abbot was coming down the passage toward him, holding onto the arm of Brother Fuliginous, his blind eyes pearlescent in the darkness beneath his cowl.""You are awake, then, Richard Mayhew,"" said the abbot. ""How do you feel?""Richard made a face. ""My hand . . . """"We set your finger. It had been broken. We tended your bruises and your cuts. And you needed rest, which we gave you.""""Where's Door? And the marquis? How did we get here?""""I had you brought here,"" said the abbot. The two friars began to walk down the corridor, and Richard walked with them.""Hunter,"" said Richard. ""Did you bring back her body?""The abbot shook his head. ""There was no body. Only the Beast.""""Ah, um. My clothes . . . "" They came to the door of a cell, much like the one Richard had woken in. Door was sitting on the edge of her bed, reading a copy of Mansfield Park that Richard was certain the friars had not previously known that they had. She, too, wore a gray monk's robe, which was much, much too big for her, almost comically so. She looked up as they entered. ""Hello,"" she said. ""You've been asleep for ages. How are you feeling?""""Fine, I think. How are you?""She smiled. It was not a very convincing smile. ""A bit shaky,"" she admitted. There was a loud rattling in the corridor, and Richard turned to see the marquis de Carabas being wheeled toward them in a rickety and antique wheelchair. The wheelchair was being pushed by a large Black Friar. Richard wondered how the marquis managed to make being pushed around in a wheelchair look like a romantic and swashbuckling thing to do. The marquis honored them with an enormous smile. ""Good evening, friends,"" he said.""Now,"" said the abbot, ""that you are all here, we must talk.""He led them to a large room, warmed by a roaring scrap wood fire. They arranged themselves around a table. The abbot gestured for them all to sit down. He felt for his chair and sat down in it. Then he sent Brother Fuliginous and Brother Tenebrae (who had been pushing the marquis's wheelchair) out of the room.""So,"" said the abbot. ""To business. Where is Islington?""Door shrugged. ""As far away as I could send him. Halfway across space and time.""""I see,"" said the abbot. And then he said, ""Good.""""Why didn't you warn us about him?"" asked Richard.""That was not our responsibility.""Richard snorted. ""What happens now?"" he asked them all.The abbot said nothing.""Happens? In what way?"" asked Door.""Well, you wanted to avenge your family. And you have. And you've sent everyone involved off to some distant corner of nowhere. I mean, no one's going to try and kill you anymore, are they?""""Not for right now,"" said Door, seriously.""And you?"" Richard asked the marquis de Carabas. ""Have you got what you wanted?""The marquis nodded. ""I believe so. My debt to Lord Portico has been paid in full, and the Lady Door owes me a significant favor.""Richard looked to Door. She nodded. ""So what about me?"" he asked.""Well,"" said Door. ""We couldn't have done it without you.""""That's not what I meant. What about getting me back home?""The marquis raised an eyebrow. ""Who do you think she is-the Wizard of Oz? We can't send you home. This is your home.""Door said, ""I tried to tell you that before, Richard.""""There has to be a way,"" said Richard, and he slammed his left hand down on the table, hard, for emphasis. It hurt his finger, but he kept his face composed. And then he said, ""Ow,"" but he said it very quietly, because he had gone through much worse.""Where is the key?"" asked the abbot.Richard inclined his head. ""Door,"" he said.She shook her pixy head. ""I don't have it,"" she told him. ""I slipped it back into your pocket at the last market. When you brought the curry.""Richard opened his mouth, and then he closed it again. Then he opened it and said, ""You mean, when I told Croup and Vandemar that I had it, and they were welcome to search me . . . I had it?"" She nodded. He remembered the hard object in his back pocket, on Down Street; remembered her hugging him on the ship . . .The abbot reached out. His wrinkled brown fingers picked up a small bell from the table, which he shook, summoning Brother Fuliginous. ""Bring me the Warrior's trousers,"" he said. Fuliginous nodded and left.""I'm no warrior,"" said Richard.The Abbot smiled gently. ""You killed the Beast,"" he explained, almost regretfully. ""You are the Warrior.""Richard folded his arms, exasperated. ""So, after all this, I still don't get to go home, but as a consolation prize I've made it onto some kind of archaic underground honors list?""The marquis looked unsympathetic. ""You can't go back to London Above. A few individuals manage a kind of half-life-you've met Iliaster and Lear. But that's the best you could hope for, and it isn't a good life.""Door reached out a hand, and touched Richard's arm. ""I'm sorry,"" she told him. ""But look at all the good you've done. You got the key for us.""""Well,"" he asked, ""what was the point of that? You just forged a new key-"" Brother Fuliginous reappeared, carrying Richard's jeans; they were ripped, and covered in mud, and splashed with dried blood, and they stank. The friar handed the trousers to the abbot, who commenced to go through the pockets. Door smiled, sweetly. ""I couldn't have had Hammersmith copy it without the original,"" she reminded him.The abbot cleared his throat. ""You are all very stupid people,"" he told them, graciously, ""and you do not know anything at all."" He held up the silver key. It glinted in the firelight. ""Richard passed the Ordeal of the Key. He is its master, until he returns it to our keeping. The key has power.""""It's the key to Heaven . . . "" said Richard, unsure of what the abbot was getting at, of what point he was trying to make.The old man's voice was deep and melodious. ""The key is the key to all reality. If Richard wants to return to London Above, then the key will take him back to London Above.""""It's that simple?"" asked Richard. The old man nodded his blind head, beneath the shadows of his cowl. ""Then when could we do this?""""As soon as you are ready,"" said the abbot.The friars had washed and repaired his clothes and returned them to him. Brother Fuliginous led him through the abbey, up a vertiginous series of ladders and steps, up into the bell tower. There was a heavy wooden trapdoor in the top of the tower. Brother Fuliginous unlocked it, and the two men pushed through it and found themselves in a narrow tunnel, thickly cobwebbed, with metal rungs set in the side of one wall. They climbed the rungs, going up for what seemed like thousands of feet, and came out on a dusty Underground station platform.NIGHTINGALE LANEsaid the old signs on the wall. Brother Fuliginous wished Richard well and told him to wait there and he would be collected, and then he clambered down the side of the wall, and he was gone.Richard sat on the platform for twenty minutes. He wondered what kind of station this was: it seemed neither abandoned, like British Museum, nor real, like Blackfriars: instead it was a ghost-station, an imaginary place, forgotten and strange. He wondered why the marquis had not said good-bye. When Richard had asked Door, she had said that she didn't know, but that maybe good-byes were something else, like comforting people, at which the marquis wasn't much good. Then she told him that she had something in her eye, and she gave him a paper with his instructions on, and she went away.Something waved from the darkness of the tunnel: something white. It was a handkerchief on a stick. ""Hello?"" called Richard.The feather-wrapped roundness of Old Bailey stepped out of the gloom, looking self-conscious and ill at ease. He was waving Richard's handkerchief, and he was sweating. ""It's me little flag,"" he said, pointing to the handkerchief.""I'm glad it's come in useful.""Old Bailey grinned uneasily. ""Right. Just wanted to say. Something I got for you. Here you go."" He thrust a hand into a coat pocket and pulled out a long black feather with a blue-purple-green sheen to it; red thread had been wound around the quill end of the feather.""Um. Well, thanks,"" said Richard, unsure of what he ought to do with it.""It's a feather,"" explained Old Bailey. ""And a good one. Memento. Souvenir. Keepsake. And it's free. A gift. Me to you. Bit of a thank-you.""""Yes. Well. Very kind of you.""Richard put it in his pocket. A warm wind blew through the tunnel: a train was coming. ""This'll be your train now,"" said Old Bailey. ""I don't take trains, me. Give me a good roof any day."" He shook Richard's hand, and fled.The train pulled in at the station, its headlights were turned off, and there was nobody standing in the driver's compartment in the front. It came to a full stop: all the carriages were dark, and no doors opened. Richard knocked on the door in front of him, hoping that it was the correct one. The door gaped open, flooding the imaginary station with warm yellow light. Two small, elderly gentlemen holding long, copper-colored bugles stepped off the train and onto the platform. Richard recognized them: Dagvard and Halvard, from Earl's Court; although he could no longer recall, if he had ever known, which gentleman was which. They put their bugles to their lips and performed a ragged, but sincere, fanfare. Richard got onto the train, and they walked in behind him.The earl was sitting at the end of the carriage, petting the enormous Irish wolfhound. The jester- Tooley, thought Richard, that was his name-stood beside him. Other than that, and the two men-at-arms, the carriage was deserted. ""Who is it?"" asked the earl.""It's him, sire,"" said his jester. ""Richard Mayhew. The one who killed the Beast.""""The Warrior?"" The Earl scratched his red-gray beard thoughtfully. ""Bring him here.""Richard walked down to the earl's chair. The earl eyed him up and down pensively and gave no indication that he remembered ever meeting Richard before. ""Thought you'd be taller,"" said the earl, at length.""Sorry.""""Well, better get on with it."" The old man stood up and addressed the empty car. ""Good evening. Here to honor young Mayflower. What was it the bard said?"" And then he recited, in a rhythmic alliterative boom, ""Crimson the cuts in the carcass, Fast falls the foe, Dauntless devout defender, Bravest of boys . . . Not really a boy anymore, though, is he, Tooley?""""Not particularly, Your Grace.""The earl reached out his hand. ""Give me your sword, boy.""Richard put his hand to his belt and pulled out the knife that Hunter had given him. ""Will this do?"" he asked.""Yes-yes,"" said the old man, taking the knife from him.""Kneel,"" said Tooley, in a stage whisper, pointing to the train floor. Richard went down on one knee; the earl tapped him gently on each shoulder with the knife. ""Arise,"" he bellowed, ""Sir Richard of Maybury. With this knife I do give to you the freedom of the Underside. May you be allowed to walk freely, without let or hindrance . . . and so on and so forth . . . et cetera . . . blah blah blah,"" he trailed of vaguely.""Thanks,"" said Richard. ""It's Mayhew, actually."" But the train was coming to a stop.""This is where you get off,"" said the earl. He gave Richard his knife-Hunter's knife-once more, patted him on the back, and pointed toward the door.The place that Richard got off was not an Underground station. It was above ground, and it reminded Richard a little of St. Pancras Station-there was something similarly oversized and mock-Gothic about the architecture. But there was also a wrongness that somehow marked it as part of London Below. The light was that strange, strained gray one only sees shortly before dawn and for a few moments after sunset, the times when the world washes out into gloom, and color and distance become impossible to judge.There was a man sitting on a wooden bench, watching him; and Richard approached him, cautiously, unable to tell, in the gloaming, who the man was, whether it was someone he had met before. Richard was still holding Hunter's knife-his knife- and now he gripped the hilt more tightly, for reassurance. The man looked up as Richard approached, and he sprang to his feet. He tugged at his forelock, something Richard had previously only seen done on television adaptations of classic novels. He looked both comical and unpleasant. Richard recognized the man as the Lord Rat-speaker.""Well-well. Yes-yes,"" said the rat-speaker, agitatedly, beginning in mid-sentence, ""Just to say, the girl Anaesthesia. No hard feelings. The rats are your friends, still. And the rat-speakers. You come to us. We'll do you all right.""""Thanks,"" said Richard. Anaesthesia will take him, he thought. She's expendable.The Lord Rat-speaker fumbled on the bench, and presented Richard with a black vinyl zip-up sports bag. It was extremely familiar. ""It's all there. Everything. Take a look."" Richard opened the bag. All his possessions were in there, including, on top of some neatly folded jeans, his wallet. He zipped the bag up, threw it over his shoulder, and walked away from the man, without a thank-you or a backward glance.Richard walked out of the station and down some gray stone steps. All was silent. All was empty. Dead autumn leaves blew across an open court, a flurry of yellow and ochre and brown, a sudden burst of muted color in the dim light. Richard crossed the court and walked down some steps into an underpass. There was a fluttering in the half-dark, and, warily, he turned. There were about a dozen of them, in the corridor behind him, and they slipped toward him almost silently, just a rustle of dark velvet, and, here and there, the clink of silver jewelery. The rustle of the leaves had been so much louder than these pale women. They watched him with hungry eyes.He was scared, then. He had the knife, true, but he could no more fight with it than he could jump across the Thames. He hoped that, if they attacked, he might be able to scare them away with it. He could smell honeysuckle, and lily of the valley, and musk.Lamia edged her way to the front of the Velvets, and stepped forward. Richard raised the knife, nervously, remembering the chilly passion of her embrace, how pleasant it was and how cold. She smiled at him, and inclined her head, sweetly. Then she kissed her fingertips, and blew the kiss toward Richard.He shivered. Something fluttered in the darkness of the underpass; and when he looked again, there was nothing but shadows.Through the underpass, and Richard walked up some steps, and found himself at the top of a small grassy hill. It was dawn, and he could just make out details of the countryside around him: almost leafless oak, and ash, and beech trees, readily identifiable by the shapes of their trunks. A wide, clean river meandered gently through the green countryside. As he looked around, he realized that he was on an island of some kind-two smaller rivers ran into the larger one, cutting him off on his little hill, from the mainland. He knew then, without knowing how, but with total certainty, that he was still in London, but London as it had been perhaps three thousand years ago, or more, before ever the first stone of the first human habitation was laid upon a stone.He unzipped his bag and put the knife away in it, beside his wallet. Then he zipped it up again. The sky was starting to lighten, but the light was odd. It was younger, somehow, than the sunlight he was familiar with-purer, perhaps. An orange-red sun rose in the east, where Docklands would one day be, and Richard watched the dawn breaking over forests and marshes that he kept thinking of as Greenwich and Kent and the sea.""Hello,"" said Door. He had not seen her approach. She was wearing different clothes beneath her battered brown leather jacket: they were still layered and ripped and patched, though, in taffeta and lace and silk and brocade. Her short red hair shone in the dawn like burnished copper.""Hello,"" said Richard. She stood beside him and twined her small fingers into his right hand, the hand that was holding the sports bag. ""Where are we?"" he asked.""On the awesome and terrible island of Westminster,"" she told him. It sounded as if she were quoting from somewhere, but he did not believe he had ever heard that phrase before. They began to walk together over the long grass, wet and white with melting frost. Their footprints left a dark green trail in the grass behind them, showing where they had come from.""Look,"" said Door. ""With the angel gone, there's a lot of sorting out to do in London Below. And there's only me to do it. My father wanted to unite London Below . . . I suppose I ought to try to finish what he started."" They were walking north, away from the Thames, hand in hand. White seagulls wheeled and called in the sky above them. ""Richard, you heard what Islington said to us about keeping my sister alive, just in case. I may not be the only one of my family left. And you've saved my life. More than once."" She paused, and then, all in a rush, blurted, ""You've been a really good friend to me, Richard. And I've sort of got to like having you around. Please don't go.""He squeezed her hand in his, gently. ""Well,"" he said, ""I've sort of got to like having you around, too. But I don't belong in this world. In my London . . . well, the most dangerous thing you ever have to watch out for is a taxi in a bit of a hurry. I like you, too. I like you an awful lot. But I have to go home.""She looked up at him with her odd-colored eyes, green and blue and flame. ""Then we won't ever see each other again,"" she said.""I suppose we won't.""""Thanks for everything you did,"" she said, seriously. Then she threw her arms around him, and she squeezed him tightly enough that the bruises on his ribs hurt, and he hugged her back, just as tightly, making all of his bruises complain violently, and he simply didn't care.""Well,"" he said, eventually. ""It was very nice knowing you."" She was blinking hard. He wondered if she were going to tell him again that she had something in her eye. Instead she said, ""Are you ready?""He nodded.""Have you got the key?""He put down his bag and rummaged in his back pocket with his good hand. He took out the key and handed it to her. She held it out in front of her, as if it were being inserted in an imaginary door. ""Okay,"" she said. ""Just walk. Don't look back.""He began walking down a small hill, away from the blue waters of the Thames. A gray gull swooped past. At the bottom of the hill, he looked back. She stood at the top of the hill, silhouetted by the rising sun. Her cheeks were glistening. The orange sunlight gleamed on the key. Door turned it, with one decisive motion.The world went dark, and a low roar filled Richard's head, like the maddened growling of a thousand enraged beasts.
NW_ch20	NW	Neverwhere	20	5443	30959	NeverwhereTWENTYThe world went dark, and a low roar filled Richard's head, like the maddened growling of a thousand enraged beasts. He blinked at the darkness, held tight to his bag. He wondered if he had been foolish, putting the knife away. Some people brushed past him in the dark. Richard started away from them. There were steps in front of him; Richard began to ascend, and, as he did so, the world began to resolve, to take shape and to re-form.The growling was the roar of traffic, and he was coming out of an underpass in Trafalgar Square. The sky was the perfect untroubled blue of a television screen, tuned to a dead channel.It was midmorning, on a warm October day, and he stood in the square holding his bag and blinking at the sunlight. Black taxis and red buses and multicolored cars roared and careened about the square, while tourists threw handfuls of pigeon feed down for the legions of tubby pigeons and took their snapshots of Nelson's Column and the huge Landseer lions that flanked it. He walked through the square, wondering if he was real or not. The Japanese tourists ignored him. He tried talking to a pretty fairhaired girl, who laughed, and shook her head, and said something in a language Richard thought might have been Italian, but was actually Finnish.There was a small child of indeterminate sex, staring at some pigeons while orally demolishing a chocolate bar. He crouched down next to it. ""Ur Hello, kiddie,"" said Richard. The child sucked its chocolate bar intently and gave no indication of recognizing Richard as another human being. ""Hello,"" repeated Richard, a slight note of desperation creeping into his voice. ""Can you see me? Kiddie? Hello? Two small eyes glared at him from a chocolate covered face. And then its lower lip began to tremble, and the child fled, throwing its arms around the legs of the nearest adult female, and wailing ""Mommy? This man's bothering me. He's bothering me.""The child's mother turned on Richard with a formidable scowl. ""What are you doing,"" she demanded, ""bothering our Leslie? There are places for people like you.""Richard began to smile. It was a huge and happy smile. ""I really am most frightfully sorry,"" he said, grinning like a Cheshire cat. And then, clutching his bag, he ran through Trafalgar Square, accompanied by bursts of sudden pigeons, who took to the air in astonishment.He took his cashcard out of his wallet, and he put it into the cash machine. It recognized his four-digit pin number, advised him to keep it a secret and not disclose it to anyone, and asked what kind of service he would like. He asked for cash, and it gave him cash in abundance. He punched the air in delight, and then, embarrassed, pretended that he had been hailing a cab.A cab stopped for him-it stopped!-for him!-and he climbed in, and sat in the back, and beamed. He asked the driver to take him to his office. And when the cab driver pointed out that it would almost be quicker to walk, Richard grinned even wider, and said he did not care. And as soon as they were underway he asked-practically begged-the cab driver to regale him, Richard, with his opinions on Inner-City Traffic Problems, How Best to Deal with Crime, and Thorny Political Issues of the Day. The cab driver accused Richard of ""taking the Mickey,"" and sulked for all of the five-minute journey up the Strand. Richard did not care. He tipped the man ridiculously anyway. And then he walked into his office.As he entered the building, he felt the smile begin to leave his face. Each step he took left him more anxious, more uneasy. What if he still had no job? What did it matter if small, chocolate-covered children and cab drivers could see him, if it turned out that, by some appalling mischance, he remained invisible to his colleagues?Mr. Figgis, the security guard, looked up from a copy of Naughty Teenage Nymphets, which he had hidden inside his copy of the Sun, and he sniffed. ""Morning Mister Mayhew,"" he said. It was not a welcoming ""morning."" It was the kind of ""morning"" that implied that the speaker really did not care if the recipient lived or died-nor indeed, for that matter, if it was even morning.""Figgis!"" exclaimed Richard, in delight. ""And hello to you too, Mister Figgis, you exceptional security guard!""Nobody had ever said anything remotely like that to Mr. Figgis before, not even naked ladies in his imagination; Figgis stared suspiciously at Richard until he got into the elevator and vanished from sight, then he returned his attention to the naughty teenage nymphets, none of whom, he was beginning to suspect, was ever likely to see twenty-nine again, lollipops or no lollipops.Richard got out of the elevator and walked, slightly hesitantly, down the corridor. Everything will be all right, he told himself, if only my desk is there. If my desk is there, everything will be fine. He walked into the large room full of cubicles he had worked in for three years. People were working at desks, talking on telephones, rummaging through filing cabinets, drinking bad tea and worse coffee. It was his office. And there was the place by the window, where his desk had once been, which was now occupied by a gray cluster of filing cabinets and a yucca plant. He was about to turn and run when someone handed him a cup of tea in a Styrofoam cup.""The return of the prodigal, eh?"" said Gary. ""Here you go.""""Hello Gary,"" said Richard. ""Where's my desk?""""This way,"" said Gary. ""How was Majorca?""""Majorca?""""Don't you always go to Majorca?"" asked Gary. They were walking up the back stairs that led to the fourth floor.""Not this time,"" said Richard.""I was going to say,"" said Gary. ""Not much of a tan.""""No,"" agreed Richard. ""Well. You know. I needed a change.""Gary nodded. He pointed to a door that had, for as long as Richard had been there, been the door to the executive files and supplies room. ""A change? Well, you've certainly got one now. And may I be the first to congratulate you?"" The plaque on the door said:R. B. MAYHEW JUNIOR PARTNER""Lucky bastard,"" said Gary, affectionately.He wandered off, and Richard went through the door, utterly bemused. The room was no longer an executive supplies and file room: it had been emptied of files and supplies, and painted in gray and black and white, and recarpeted. In the center of the office was a large desk. He examined it: it was, unmistakably, his very own desk. His trolls had all been neatly put away in one of the desk drawers, and he took them all out, and arranged them around the office. He had his own window, with a nice view of the sludge-brown river and the South Bank of the Thames, beyond. There was even a large green plant, with huge waxy leaves, of the kind that looks artificial but isn't. His old, dusty, cream-colored computer terminal had been replaced with a much sleeker, cleaner black computer terminal, which took up less desk space.He walked over to the window and sipped his tea, staring out at the dirty brown river.""You've found everything all right, then?"" He looked up. Crisp, and efficient, Sylvia, the MD's PA, was standing in the doorway. She smiled when she saw him.""Um. Yes. Look, there are things I have to take care of at home . . . d'you think it'd be all right if I took the rest of the day off and-""""Suit yourself. You aren't meant to be back in till tomorrow anyway.""""I'm not?"" he asked. ""Right.""Sylvia frowned. ""What happened to your finger?""""I broke it,"" he told her.She looked at his hand with concern. ""You weren't in a fight, were you?""""Me?""She grinned. ""Just teasing. I suppose you shut it in a door. That's what my sister did.""""No,"" Richard began to admit, ""I was in a fi . . . "" Sylvia raised an eyebrow. ""A door,"" he finished lamely.He went to the building he had once lived in by taxi. He was not sure that he trusted himself to travel by the Underground. Not yet. Having no door key, he knocked at the door of his flat and was more than disappointed when it was opened by the woman Richard last remembered meeting, or rather, failing to meet, in his bathroom. He introduced himself as the previous tenant, and quickly established that a) he, Richard, no longer lived there, and b) she, Mrs. Buchanan, had no idea what had happened to any of his personal possessions. Richard took some notes, and then he said good-bye very nicely, and took another black taxi to go and see a man in a camel-hair coat.The smooth man in the camel-hair coat was not wearing his camel-hair coat, and was, in fact, a good deal less smooth than the last time Richard had encountered him. They were sitting in his office, and he had listened to Richard's list of complaints with the expression of someone who has recently and accidentally swallowed whole a live spider and has just begun to feel it squirm.""Well, yes,"" he admitted, after looking at the files. ""There does seem to have been some kind of problem, now you mention it. I can't quite see how it could have happened.""""I don't think it matters how it happened,"" said Richard, reasonably. ""The fact of the matter is that while I was away for a few weeks, you rented my apartment to,"" he consulted his notes, ""George and Adele Buchanan. Who have no intention of leaving.""The man closed the file. ""Well,"" he said. ""Mistakes do happen. Human error. I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about it.""The old Richard, the one who had lived in what was now the Buchanans' home, would have crumbled at this point, apologized for being a nuisance, and gone away. Instead, Richard said, ""Really? Nothing you can do about it? You rented a property I was legally renting from your company to someone else, and in the process lost all my personal possessions, and there's nothing you can do about it? Now, I happen to think, and I'm sure my lawyer will also think, that there is a great deal you can do about it.""The man without the camel-hair coat looked as if the spider was beginning to crawl back up his throat. ""But we don't have any other vacant apartments like yours in the building,"" he said. ""There's only the penthouse suite.""""That,"" Richard told the man, coldly, ""would be fine . . . "" The man relaxed. "" . . . for living accommodation. Now,"" said Richard, ""let's talk about compensation for my lost possessions.""The new apartment was much nicer than the one he had left behind. It had more windows, and a balcony, a spacious lounge, and a proper spare bedroom. Richard prowled it, dissatisfied. The man-without-a-camel-hair-coat had, extremely grudgingly, had the apartment furnished with a bed, a sofa, several chairs, and a television set. Richard put Hunter's knife on the mantelpiece. He bought a take-away curry from the Indian restaurant across the road, sat on the carpeted floor of his new apartment, and ate it, wondering if he had ever really eaten curry late at night in a street-market held on the deck of a gunship moored by Tower Bridge. It did not seem very likely, now that he thought about it.The doorbell rang. He got up and answered the door. ""We found a lot of your stuff, Mr. Mayhew,"" said the man who was once more wearing his camel-hair coat. ""Turned out it'd been put into storage. Right, bring the stuff in, lads.""A couple of burly men hauled in several large wooden packing cases, filled with Richard's stuff, and deposited them on the carpet in the middle of the living room.""Thanks,"" said Richard. He reached into the first box, unwrapped the first paper-covered object, which turned out to be a framed photograph of Jessica. He stared at it for some moments, and then he put it down again in the case. He found the box with his clothes in it, removed them, and put them away in his bedroom, but the other boxes sat, untouched, in the middle of the living room floor. As the days went on, he felt increasingly guilty about not unpacking them. But he did not unpack them.He was in his office, sitting at his desk, staring out of the window, when the intercom buzzed. ""Richard?"" said Sylvia. ""The MD wants a meeting in his office in twenty minutes to discuss the Wandsworth report.""""I'll be there,"" he said. Then, because he had nothing else to do for the next ten minutes, he picked up an orange troll and menaced a slightly smaller green-haired troll with it. ""I am the greatest warrior of London Below. Prepare to die,"" he said, in a dangerous trollish voice, waggling the orange troll. Then he picked up the green-haired troll, and said, in a smaller trollish voice, ""Aha! But first you shall drink the nice cup of tea . . . ""Someone knocked on the door, and, guiltily, he put down the trolls. ""Come in."" The door opened, and Jessica came in, and stood in the doorway. She looked nervous. He had forgotten quite how beautiful she was. ""Hello Richard,"" she said.""Hello Jess,"" said Richard, and then he corrected himself. ""Sorry-Jessica.""She smiled, and tossed her hair. ""Oh, Jess is fine,"" she said, and looked as if she almost meant it. ""Jessica-Jess. Nobody's called me Jess for ages. I rather miss it.""""So,"" said Richard, ""what brings, do I have the honor, you, um.""""Just wanted to see you, really.""He was not sure what he ought to say. ""That's nice,"" he said.She closed the door to his office and took a few steps toward him. ""Richard. You know something strange? I remember calling the engagement off. But I hardly remember what we were arguing about.""""No?""""It's not important, though. Is it?"" She looked around the office. ""You got a promotion?""""Yes.""""I'm happy for you."" She put a hand into the pocket of her coat and pulled out a small brown box. She put it down on Richard's desk. He opened the box, although he knew what was inside it. ""It's our engagement ring. I thought that, well, maybe, I'd give it back to you, and then, well, if things worked out, well, perhaps one day you'd give it back to me."" It glittered in the sunlight: the most money he had ever spent on anything. He closed the box, and gave it back to her. ""You keep it, Jessica,"" he said. And then, ""I'm sorry.""She bit her lower lip. ""Did you meet someone?"" He hesitated. He thought of Lamia, and Hunter, and Anaesthesia, and even Door, but none of them were someones in the way that she meant. ""No. No one else,"" he said. And then, realizing it was true as he said it, ""I've just changed, that's all.""His intercom buzzed. ""Richard? We're waiting for you."" He pressed the button. ""Be right down, Sylvia.""He looked at Jessica. She said nothing. Perhaps there was nothing she could trust herself to say. She walked away, and she closed the door quietly behind her.Richard picked up the papers he would need, with one hand. He ran the other hand across his face, as if he were wiping something away: sorrow, perhaps, or tears, or Jessica.He started taking the Tube again, to and from work, although he soon found that he had stopped buying newspapers to read on his journey in the morning and the evening, and instead of reading he would scan the faces of the other people on the train, faces of every kind and color, and wonder if they were all from London Above, wonder what went on behind their eyes.During the evening rush hour, a few days after his encounter with Jessica, he thought he saw Lamia across the carriage, with her back to him, her dark hair piled high on her head and her dress long and black. His heart began to pound in his chest. He pushed his way toward her through the crowded compartment. As he got closer, the train pulled into a station, the doors hissed open, and she stepped off. But it was not Lamia. Just another young London goth-girl, he realized, disappointed, off for a night on the town.One Saturday afternoon he saw a large brown rat, sitting on top of the plastic garbage cans at the back of Newton Mansions, cleaning its whiskers and looking as if it owned the world. At Richard's approach it leapt down onto the pavement and waited in the shadow of the garbage cans, staring up at him with wary bead-black eyes.Richard crouched down. ""Hello,"" he said, gently. ""Do we know each other?"" The rat made no kind of response that Richard was able to perceive, but it did not run away. ""My name is Richard Mayhew,"" he continued, in a low voice. ""I'm not actually a rat-speaker, but I, um, know a few rats, well, I've met some, and I wondered if you were familiar with the Lady Door""He heard a shoe scrape behind him, and he turned to see the Buchanans looking at him curiously. ""Have you . . . lost something?"" asked Mrs. Buchanan. Richard heard, but ignored, her husband's gruff whisper of ""Just his marbles.""""No,"" said Richard, honestly, ""I was, um, saying hello to a . . . "" The rat scurried off and away.""Was that a rat?"" barked George Buchanan. ""I'll complain to the council. It's a disgrace. But that's London for you, isn't it?""Yes, agreed Richard. It was. It really was.Richard's possessions continued to sit untouched in the wooden packing cases in the middle of the living room floor.He had not yet turned on the television. He would come home at night, and eat, then he would stand at the window, looking out over London, at the cars and the rooftops and the lights, as the late autumn twilight turned into night, and the lights came on all over the city. He would watch, standing alone in his darkened flat, until the city's lights began to be turned off. Eventually, reluctantly, he would undress, and climb into bed, and go to sleep.Sylvia came into his office one Friday afternoon. He was opening envelopes, using his knife-Hunter's knife-as a letter-opener. ""Richard?"" she said. ""I was wondering. Are you getting out much, these days?"" He shook his head. ""Well, a bunch of us are going out this evening. Do you fancy coming along?""""Um. Sure,"" he said. ""Yes. I'd love it.""He hated it.There were eight of them: Sylvia and her young man, who had something to do with vintage cars, Gary from Corporate Accounts, who had recently broken up with his girlfriend, due to what Gary persisted in describing as a slight misunderstanding (he had thought she would be rather more understanding about his sleeping with her best friend than she had in fact turned out to be), several perfectly nice people and friends of nice people, and the new girl from Computer Services.First they saw a film on the huge screen of the Odeon, Leicester Square. The good guy won in the end, and there were plenty of explosions and flying objects on the way. Sylvia decided that Richard should sit next to the girl from Computer Services, as, she explained, she was new to the company and did not know many people.They walked down to Old Compton Street, on the edge of Soho, where the tawdry and the chic sit side by side to the benefit of both, and they ate at La Reache, filling up on couscous and dozens of marvelous plates of exotic food, which covered their table and spilled over onto an unused table nearby, and they walked from there to a small pub Sylvia liked in nearby Berwick Street, and they had a few drinks, and they chatted.The new girl from Computer Services smiled at Richard a lot, as the evening went on, and he had nothing at all to say to her. He bought a round of drinks for the party, and the girl from Computer Services helped him carry them from the bar back to their table. Gary went off to the men's room, and the girl from Computer Services came and sat next to Richard, taking his place. Richard's head was filled with the clink of glasses, and the blare of the jukebox, and the sharp smell of beer and spilt Bacardi and cigarette smoke. He tried to listen to the conversations going on at the table, and he found that he could no longer concentrate on what anyone was saying, and, which was worse, that he was not interested in any of what he was able to hear.And it came to him then, as clearly and as certainly as if he had been watching it on the big screen at the Odeon, Leicester Square: the rest of his life. He would go home tonight with the girl from Computer Services, and they would make gentle love, and tomorrow, it being Saturday, they would spend the morning in bed. And then they would get up, and together they would remove his possessions from the packing cases, and put them away. In a year, or a little less, he would marry the girl from Computer Services, and get another promotion, and they would have two children, a boy and a girl, and they would move out to the suburbs, to Harrow or Croydon or Hampstead or even as far away as distant Reading.And it would not be a bad life. He knew that, too. Sometimes there is nothing you can do.When Gary came back from the toilet, he looked around in puzzlement. Everyone was there except . . . ""Dick?"" he asked ""Has anyone seen Richard?""The girl from Computer Services shrugged.Gary went outside, to Berwick Street. The cold of the night air was like a splash of water to his face. He could taste winter in the air. He called, ""Dick? Hey? Richard?""""Over here.""Richard was leaning against a wall, in the shadows. ""Just getting a breath of fresh air.""""Are you all right?"" asked Gary.""Yes,"" said Richard. ""No. I don't know.""""Well,"" said Gary, ""that covers your options. Do you want to talk about it?""Richard looked at him seriously. ""You'll laugh at me.""""I'll do that anyway.""Richard looked at Gary. Then Gary was relieved to see him smile, and he knew that they were still friends. Gary looked back at the pub. Then he put his hands into his coat pockets. ""Come on,"" he said. ""Let's walk. You can get it off your chest. Then I'll laugh at you.""""Bastard,"" said Richard, sounding a lot more like Richard than he had in recent weeks.""It's what friends are for.""They began to amble off, under the streetlights. ""Look, Gary,"" Richard began. ""Do you ever wonder if this is all there is?""""What?""Richard gestured vaguely, taking in everything. ""Work. Home. The pub. Meeting girls. Living in the city. Life. Is that all there is?""""I think that sums it up, yes,"" said Gary.Richard sighed. ""Well,"" he said, ""for a start, I didn't go to Majorca. I mean, I really didn't go to Majorca.""Richard talked as they walked up and down the warren of tiny Soho back streets between Regent Street and the Charing Cross Road. He talked, and talked, beginning with finding a girl bleeding on the pavement, and trying to help, because he couldn't just leave her there, and what happened next. And when they got too cold to walk they went into an all-night greasy spoon cafe. It was a proper one, the kind that cooked everything in lard, and served cups of serious tea in large chipped white mugs shiny with bacon grease. Richard and Gary sat and Richard talked while Gary listened, and then they ordered fried eggs and baked beans and toast and sat and ate them, while Richard continued to talk, and Gary continued to listen. They mopped up the last of their egg yolks with the toast. They drank more tea, until eventually Richard said, "" . . . and then Door did something with the key, and I was back again. In London Above. Well, the real London. And, well, you know the rest.""There was a silence. ""That's all,"" said Richard. He finished his tea.Gary scratched his head. ""Look,"" he said, at length. ""Is this real? Not some kind of horrible joke? I mean, somebody with a camera isn't about to leap out from behind a screen or something and tell me I'm on Candid Camera?""""I sincerely hope not,"" said Richard. ""You . . . do you believe me?""Gary looked at the bill on their table, counted out pound coins, and dropped them onto the Formica, where they sat beside a plastic tomato ketchup container in the shape of an oversized tomato, old ketchup caked black about its nozzle. ""I believe that, well, something happened to you, obviously . . . Look, more to the point, do you believe it?""Richard stared up at him. There were dark circles beneath Richard's eyes. ""Do I believe it? I don't know anymore. I did. I was there. There was a part in there when you turned up, you know.""""You didn't mention that before.""""It was a pretty horrid part. You told me that I'd gone mad and I was just wandering around London hallucinating.""They walked out of the cafe and walked south, toward Piccadilly. ""Well,"" said Gary, ""you must admit, it sounds more likely than your magical London underneath, where the people who fall through the cracks go. I've passed the people who fall through the cracks, Richard: they sleep in shop doorways all down the Strand. They don't go to a special London. They freeze to death in the winter.""Richard said nothing.Gary continued. ""I think maybe you got some kind of blow on the head. Or maybe some kind of shock when Jessica chucked you. For a while you went a little crazy. Then you got better.""Richard shivered. ""You know what scares me? I think you could be right.""""So life isn't exciting?"" continued Gary. ""Great. Give me boredom. At least I know where I'm going to eat and sleep tonight. I'll still have a job on Monday. Yeah?"" He turned and looked at Richard.Richard nodded, hesitantly. ""Yeah.""Gary looked at his watch. ""Bloody hell,"" he exclaimed. ""It's after two o'clock. Let's hope there are still a few taxis about."" They walked into Brewer Street, at the Piccadilly end of Soho, wandering past the lights of the peep shows and the strip clubs. Gary was talking about taxis. He was not saying anything original, or even interesting. He was simply fulfilling his obligation as a Londoner to grumble about taxis. "" . . . Had his light on and everything,"" he was saying, ""I told him where I wanted to go, he said, sorry, I'm on my way home, I said, where do all you taxi drivers live anyway? And why don't any of you live near me? The trick is to get in first, then tell them you live south of the river, I mean, what was he trying to tell me? The way he was carrying on, Battersea might as well have been in bloody Katmandu . . . ""Richard had tuned him out. When they reached Windmill Street, Richard crossed the road and stared into the window of the Vintage Magazine Shop, examining the cartoonish models of forgotten film stars and the old posters and comics and magazines on display. It had been a glimpse into a world of adventure and imagination. And it was not true. He told himself that.""So, what do you think?"" Gary asked.Richard jerked back to the present. ""Of what?""Gary realized Richard had not heard a word he had said. He said it again. ""If there aren't any taxis we could get night buses.""""Yeah,"" said Richard. ""Great. Fine.""Gary grimaced. ""You worry me.""""Sorry.""They walked down Windmill Street, toward Piccadilly. Richard thrust his hands deep into his pockets. He looked puzzled for a moment, and pulled out a rather crumpled black crow's feather, with red thread tied around the quill.""What's that?"" asked Gary.""It's a-"" He stopped. ""It's just a feather. You're right. It's only rubbish."" He dropped the feather in the gutter at the curb, and did not look back.Gary hesitated. Then he said, picking his words with care, ""Have you thought about seeing somebody?""""See somebody? Look, I'm not crazy, Gary.""""Are you sure about that?"" A taxi came toward them, yellow for-hire light burning.""No,"" said Richard, honestly. ""Here's a taxi. You take it. I'll take the next one.""""Thanks."" Gary waved down the taxi and climbed into the back before telling the driver that he wished to go to Battersea. He pulled down the window, and, as the taxi pulled out, he said, ""Richard-this is reality. Get used to it. It's all there is. See you on Monday.""Richard waved at him and watched the taxi drive away. Then he turned around and walked slowly away from the lights of Piccadilly, back up toward Brewer Street. There was no longer a feather by the curb. Richard paused beside an old woman, fast asleep in a shop doorway. She was covered with a ripped old blanket, and her few possessions-two small junk-filled cardboard boxes and a dirty, once-white umbrella-were tied together with string beside her, and the string was tied around her wrist, to keep anyone from stealing them while she slept. She wore a wool hat, of no particular color.He pulled out his wallet, found a ten-pound note, and bent down to slide the folded note into the woman's hand. Her eyes opened, and she jerked awake. She blinked at the money with old eyes. ""What's this?"" she said, sleepily, displeased at having been woken. ""Keep it,"" said Richard.She unfolded the money, then pushed it up her sleeve. ""Whatchyouwant?"" she asked Richard, suspiciously.""Nothing,"" said Richard. ""I really don't want anything. Nothing at all."" And then he realized how true that was; and how dreadful a thing it had become. ""Have you ever got everything you ever wanted? And then realized it wasn't what you wanted at all?""""Can't say that I have,"" she said, picking the sleep from the corner of her eyes.""I thought I wanted this,"" said Richard. ""I thought I wanted a nice, normal life. I mean, maybe I am crazy. I mean, maybe. But if this is all there is, then I don't want to be sane. You know?"" She shook her head. He reached into his inside pocket. ""You see this?"" he said. He held up the knife. ""Hunter gave this to me as she died,"" he told her.""Don't hurt me,"" said the old lady. ""I ain't done nuffing.""He heard a strange intensity in his own voice. ""I wiped her blood from the blade. A hunter looks after her weapons. The earl knighted me with it. He gave me the freedom of the Underside.""""I don't know anyfing about that,"" she said. ""Please. Put it away. That's a good lad.""Richard hefted the knife. Then he lunged toward the brick wall, next to the doorway in which the woman had been sleeping. He slashed three times, once horizontally, twice vertically. ""What you doin'?"" asked the woman, warily.""Making a door,"" he told her.She sniffed. ""You ought to put that thing away. If the police see you they'll run you in for offensive weapons.""Richard looked at the outline of a doorway he had scratched on the wall. He put his knife back into his pocket, and he began to hammer on the wall with his fists. ""Hey! Is there anyone there? Can you hear me? It's me-Richard. Door? Someone?"" He hurt his hands, but he kept banging and flailing at the brickwork.And then the madness left him, and he stopped.""Sorry,"" he said to the old lady.She did not answer. She had either gone back to sleep or, more probably, pretended to go back to sleep. Elderly snores, real or feigned, came from the doorway. Richard sat down on the pavement, and wondered how someone could make such a mess of their life as he had made of his. Then he looked back at the doorway he had scratched on the wall.There was a door-shaped hole in the wall, where he had scratched his outline. There was a man standing in the doorway, with his arms folded theatrically. He stood there until he was certain that Richard had seen him. And then he yawned hugely, covering his mouth with a dark hand.The marquis de Carabas raised an eyebrow. ""Well?"" he said, irritably. ""Are you coming?""Richard stared at him for a heartbeat.Then Richard nodded, without trusting himself to speak, and stood up. And they walked away together through the hole in the wall, back into the darkness, leaving nothing behind them; not even the doorway.
OCEAN_ch0	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	0	1784	9282	I wore a black suit and a white shirt, a black tie and black shoes, all polished and shiny: clothes that normally would make me feel uncomfortable, as if I were in a stolen uniform, or pretending to be an adult. Today they gave me comfort, of a kind. I was wearing the right clothes for a hard day.
I had done my duty in the morning, spoken the words I was meant to speak, and I meant them as I spoke them, and then, when the service was done, I got in my car and I drove, randomly, without a plan, with an hour or so to kill before I met more people I had not seen for years and shook more hands and drank too many cups of tea from the best china. I drove along winding Sussex country roads I only half remembered, until I found myself headed towards the town centre, so I turned, randomly, down another road, and took a left, and a right. It was only then that I realised where I was going, where I had been going all along, and I grimaced at my own foolishness.
I had been driving towards a house that had not existed for decades.
I thought of turning around, then, as I drove down a wide street that had once been a flint lane beside a barley field, of turning back and leaving the past undisturbed. But I was curious.
The old house, the one I had lived in for seven years, from when I was five until I was twelve, that house had been knocked down and was lost for good. The new house, the one my parents had built at the bottom of the garden, between the azalea bushes and the green circle in the grass we called the fairy ring, that had been sold thirty years ago.
I slowed the car as I saw the new house. It would always be the new house in my head. I pulled up into the driveway, observing the way they had built out on the mid-seventies architecture. I had forgotten that the bricks of the house were chocolate brown. The new people had made my mother's tiny balcony into a two-storey sunroom. I stared at the house, remembering less than I had expected about my teenage years: no good times, no bad times. I'd lived in that place, for a while, as a teenager. It didn't seem to be any part of who I was now.
I backed the car out of their driveway.
It was time, I knew, to drive to my sister's bustling, cheerful house, all tidied and stiff for the day. I would talk to people whose existence I had forgotten years before and they would ask me about my marriage (failed a decade ago, a relationship that had slowly frayed until eventually, as they always seem to, it broke) and whether I was seeing anyone (I wasn't; I was not even sure that I could, not yet), and they would ask about my children (all grown up, they have their own lives, they wish they could be here today), and work (doing fine, thank you, I would say, never knowing how to talk about what I do. If I could talk about it, I would not have to do it. I make art, sometimes I make true art, and sometimes it fills the empty places in my life. Some of them. Not all). We would talk about the departed; we would remember the dead.
The little country lane of my childhood had become a black tarmac road that served as a buffer between two sprawling housing estates. I drove further down it, away from the town, which was not the way I should have been travelling, and it felt good.
The slick black road became narrower, windier, became the single-lane track I remembered from my childhood, became packed earth and knobbly, bone-like flints.
Soon I was driving slowly, bumpily, down a narrow lane with brambles and briar roses on each side, wherever the edge was not a stand of hazels or a wild hedgerow. It felt like I had driven back in time. That lane was how I remembered it, when nothing else was.
I drove past Caraway Farm. I remembered being just sixteen, and kissing red-cheeked, fair-haired Callie Anders, who lived there, and whose family would soon move to the Shetlands, and I would never kiss her or see her again. Then nothing but fields on either side of the road, for almost a mile: a tangle of meadows. Slowly the lane became a track. It was reaching its end.
I remembered it before I turned the corner and saw it, in all its dilapidated red-brick glory: the Hempstocks' farmhouse.
It took me by surprise, although that was where the lane had always ended. I could have gone no further. I parked the car at the side of the farmyard. I had no plan. I wondered whether, after all these years, there was anyone still living there, or, more precisely, if the Hempstocks were still living there. It seemed unlikely, but then, from what little I remembered, they had been unlikely people.
The stench of cow muck struck me as I got out of the car, and I walked gingerly across the small yard to the front door. I looked for a doorbell, in vain, and then I knocked. The door had not been latched properly, and it swung gently open as I rapped it with my knuckles.
I had been here, hadn't I, a long time ago? I was sure I had. Childhood memories are sometimes covered and obscured beneath the things that come later, like childhood toys forgotten at the bottom of a crammed adult closet, but they are never lost for good. I stood in the hallway and called, 'Hello? Is there anybody here?'
I heard nothing. I smelled bread baking and wax furniture polish and old wood. My eyes were slow to adjust to the darkness: I peered into it, was getting ready to turn and leave when an elderly woman came out of the dim hallway holding a white duster. She wore her grey hair long.
I said, 'Mrs Hempstock?'
She tipped her head to one side, looked at me. 'Yes. I do know you, young man,' she said. I am not a young man. Not any longer. 'I know you, but things get messy when you get to my age. Who are you, exactly?'
'I think I must have been about seven, maybe eight, the last time I was here.'
She smiled then. 'You were Lettie's friend? From the top of the lane?'
'You gave me milk. It was warm, from the cows.' And then I realised how many years had gone by, and I said, 'No, you didn't do that, that must have been your mother who gave me the milk. I'm sorry.' As we age, we become our parents; live long enough and we see faces repeat in time. I remembered Mrs Hempstock, Lettie's mother, as a stout woman. This woman was stick-thin, and she looked delicate. She looked like her mother, like the woman I had known as Old Mrs Hempstock.
Sometimes when I look in the mirror I see my father's face, not my own, and I remember the way he would smile at himself, in mirrors, before he went out. 'Looking good,' he'd say to his reflection, approvingly. 'Looking good.'
'Are you here to see Lettie?' Mrs Hempstock asked.
'Is she here?' The idea surprised me. She had gone somewhere, hadn't she? America?
The old woman shook her head. 'I was just about to put the kettle on. Do you fancy a spot of tea?'
I hesitated. Then I said that, if she didn't mind, I'd like it if she could point me towards the duckpond first.
'Duckpond?'
I knew Lettie had had a funny name for it. I remembered that. 'She called it the sea. Something like that.'
The old woman put the cloth down on the dresser. 'Can't drink the water from the sea, can you? Too salty. Like drinking life's blood. Do you remember the way? You can get to it around the side of the house. Just follow the path.'
If you'd asked me an hour before, I would have said no, I did not remember the way. I do not even think I would have remembered Lettie Hempstock's name. But standing in that hallway, it was all coming back to me. Memories were waiting at the edges of things, beckoning to me. Had you told me that I was seven again, I might have half believed you, for a moment.
'Thank you.'
I walked into the farmyard. I went past the chicken coop, past the old barn and along the edge of the field, remembering where I was, and what was coming next, and exulting in the knowledge. Hazels lined the side of the meadow. I picked a handful of the green nuts, put them in my pocket.
The pond is next, I thought. I just have to go around this shed, and I'll see it.
I saw it and felt oddly proud of myself, as if that one act of memory had blown away some of the cobwebs of the day.
The pond was smaller than I remembered. There was a little wooden shed on the far side, and, by the path, an ancient, heavy wood-and-metal bench. The peeling wooden slats had been painted green a few years ago. I sat on the bench, and stared at the reflection of the sky in the water, at the scum of duckweed at the edges, and the half-dozen lily pads. Every now and again I tossed a hazelnut into the middle of the pond, the pond that Lettie Hempstock had called ...
It wasn't the sea, was it?
She would be older than I am now, Lettie Hempstock. She was only a handful of years older than I was back then, for all her funny talk. She was eleven. I was ... what was I? It was after the bad birthday party. I knew that. So I would have been seven.
I wondered if we had ever fallen in the water. Had I pushed her into the duckpond, that strange girl who lived in the farm at the very bottom of the lane? I remembered her being in the water. Perhaps she had pushed me in too.
Where did she go? America? No, Australia. That was it. Somewhere a long way away.
And it wasn't the sea. It was the ocean.
Lettie Hempstock's ocean.
I remembered that, and, remembering that, I remembered everything.
OCEAN_ch1	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	1	1272	6500	Nobody came to my seventh birthday party.
There was a table laid with jellies and trifles, with a party hat beside each place and a birthday cake with seven candles on it in the centre of the table. The cake had a book drawn on it, in icing. My mother, who had organised the party, told me that the lady at the bakery said that they had never put a book on a birthday cake before, and that mostly for boys it was footballs or spaceships. I was their first book.
When it became obvious that nobody was coming, my mother lit the seven candles on the cake, and I blew them out. I ate a slice of the cake, as did my little sister and one of her friends (both of them attending the party as observers, not participants), before they fled, giggling, to the garden.
Party games had been prepared by my mother, but because nobody was there, not even my sister, none of the party games were played, and I unwrapped the newspaper around the pass-the-parcel gift myself, revealing a blue plastic Batman figure. I was sad that nobody had come to my party, but happy that I had a Batman figure, and there was a birthday present waiting to be read, a boxed set of the Narnia books, which I took upstairs. I lay on the bed and lost myself in the stories.
I liked that. Books were safer than other people anyway.
My parents had also given me a Best of Gilbert and Sullivan LP, to add to the two that I already had. I had loved Gilbert and Sullivan since I was three, when my father's youngest sister, my aunt, took me to see Iolanthe, a play filled with lords and fairies. I found the existence and nature of the fairies easier to understand than that of the lords. My aunt had died soon after, of pneumonia, in the hospital.
That evening, when my father arrived home from work, he brought a cardboard box with him. In the cardboard box was a soft-haired black kitten of uncertain gender, which I immediately named Fluffy, and which I loved utterly and wholeheartedly.
Fluffy slept on my bed at night. I talked to it, sometimes, when my little sister was not around, half expecting it to answer in a human tongue. It never did. I did not mind. The kitten was affectionate and interested and a good companion for someone whose seventh birthday party had consisted of a table with iced biscuits and a blancmange and cake and fifteen empty folding chairs.
I do not remember ever asking any of the other children in my class at school why they had not come to my party. I did not need to ask them. They were not my friends, after all. They were just the people I went to school with.
I made friends slowly, when I made them.
I had books, and now I had my kitten. We would be like Dick Whittington and his cat, I knew, or, if Fluffy proved particularly intelligent, we would be the miller's son and Puss in Boots. The kitten slept on my pillow, and it even waited for me to come home from school, sitting on the driveway in front of my house, by the fence, until, a month later, it was run over by the taxi that brought the opal miner to stay.
I was not there when it happened.
I got home from school that day, and my kitten was not waiting to meet me. In the kitchen was a tall, rangy man with tanned skin and a checked shirt. He was drinking coffee at the kitchen table, I could smell it. In those days all coffee was instant coffee, a bitter dark brown powder that came out of a jar.
'I'm afraid I had a little accident arriving here,' he told me, cheerfully. 'But not to worry.' His accent was clipped, unfamiliar: it was the first South African accent I had heard.
He, too, had a cardboard box on the table in front of him.
'The black kitten, was he yours?' he asked.
'It's called Fluffy,' I said.
'Yeah. Like I said. Accident coming here. Not to worry. Disposed of the corpse. Don't have to trouble yourself. Dealt with the matter. Open the box.'
'What?'
He pointed to the box. 'Open it,' he said.
The opal miner was a tall man. He wore jeans and checked shirts every time I saw him, except the last. He had a thick chain of pale gold around his neck. That was gone the last time I saw him, too.
I did not want to open his box. I wanted to go off on my own. I wanted to cry for my kitten, but I could not do that if anyone else was there and watching me. I wanted to mourn. I wanted to bury my friend at the bottom of the garden, past the green-grass fairy ring, into the rhododendron bush cave, back past the heap of grass cuttings, where nobody ever went but me.
The box moved.
'Bought it for you,' said the man. 'Always pay my debts.'
I reached out, lifted the top flap of the box, wondering if this was a joke, if my kitten would be in there. Instead a ginger face stared up at me truculently.
The opal miner took the cat out of the box.
He was a huge, ginger-striped tomcat, missing half an ear. He glared at me angrily. This cat had not liked being put in a box. He was not used to boxes. I reached out to stroke his head, feeling unfaithful to the memory of my kitten, but he pulled back, so I could not touch him, and he hissed at me then stalked off to a far corner of the room, where he sat and looked and hated.
'There you go. Cat for a cat,' said the opal miner, and he ruffled my hair with his leathery hand. Then he went out into the hall, leaving me in the kitchen with the cat that was not my kitten.
The man put his head back through the door. 'It's called Monster,' he said.
It felt like a bad joke.
I propped open the kitchen door, so the cat could get out. Then I went up to my bedroom, and lay on my bed and cried for dead Fluffy. When my parents got home that evening, I do not think my kitten was even mentioned.
Monster lived with us for a week or more. I put cat food in the bowl for him in the morning and again at night as I had for my kitten. He would sit by the back door until I, or someone else, let him out. We saw him in the garden, slipping from bush to bush, or in trees, or in the undergrowth. We could trace his movements by the dead blue tits and thrushes we would find in the garden, but we saw him rarely.
I missed Fluffy. I knew you could not simply replace something alive, but I dared not grumble to my parents about it. They would have been baffled at my upset: after all, if my kitten had been killed, it had also been replaced. The damage had been made up.
It all came back, and even as it came back I knew it would not be for long: all the things I remembered, sitting on the green bench beside the little pond that Lettie Hempstock had once convinced me was an ocean.
OCEAN_ch2	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	2	3796	19887	I was not happy as a child, although from time to time I was content. I lived in books more than I lived anywhere else.
Our house was large and many-roomed, which was good when they bought it and my father had money, not good later.
My parents called me into their bedroom one afternoon, very formally. I thought I must have done something wrong and was there for a telling-off, but no: they told me only that they were no longer affluent, that we would all need to make sacrifices, and that what I would be sacrificing was my bedroom, the little room at the top of the stairs. I was sad: my bedroom had a tiny little yellow washbasin they had put in for me, just my size; the room was above the kitchen, and immediately up the stairs from the television room, so at night I could hear the comforting buzz of adult conversation up the stairs, through my half-open door, and I did not feel alone. Also, in my bedroom, nobody minded if I kept the hall door half open, allowing in enough light that I was not scared of the dark, and, just as important, allowing me to read secretly, after my bedtime, in the dim hallway light, if I needed to. I always needed to.
Exiled to my little sister's huge bedroom, I was not heartbroken. There were already three beds in there, and I took the bed by the window. I loved that I could climb out of that bedroom window on to the long brick balcony, that I could sleep with the window open and feel the wind and the rain on my face. But we argued, my sister and I, argued about everything. She liked to sleep with the door to the hall closed, and the immediate arguments about whether the bedroom door should be open or shut were summarily resolved by my mother writing a chart that hung on the back of the door, showing that alternate nights were mine or my sister's. Each night I was content or I was terrified, depending on whether the door was open or closed.
My former bedroom at the top of the stairs was let out, and a variety of people passed through it. I viewed them all with suspicion: they were sleeping in my bedroom, using my little yellow basin that was just the right size for me. There had been a fat Austrian lady who told us she could leave her head and walk around the ceiling; an architectural student from New Zealand; an American couple whom my mother, scandalised, made leave when she discovered they were not actually married; and now there was the opal miner.
He was a South African, although he had made his money mining for opals in Australia. He gave my sister and me an opal each, a rough black rock with green-blue-red fire in it. My sister liked him for this, and treasured her opal stone. I could not forgive him for the death of my kitten.
It was the first day of the spring holidays: three weeks of no school. I woke early, thrilled by the prospect of endless days to fill however I wished. I would read. I would explore.
I pulled on my shorts, my T-shirt, my sandals. I went downstairs to the kitchen. My father was cooking, while my mother slept in. He was wearing his dressing gown over his pyjamas. He always cooked breakfast on Saturdays. I said, 'Dad! Where's my comic?' He normally bought me a copy of SMASH! before he drove home from work on Fridays, and I would read it on Saturday mornings.
'In the back of the car. Do you want toast?'
'Yes,' I said. 'But not burnt.'
My father did not like toasters. He toasted bread under the grill, and usually, he burnt it.
I went outside into the drive. I looked around. I went back into the house, pushed the kitchen door, went in. I liked the kitchen door. It swung both ways, in and out, so servants sixty years ago would be able to walk in or out with their arms laden with dishes empty or full.
'Dad? Where's the car?'
'In the drive.'
'No it isn't.'
'What?'
The telephone rang, and my father went out into the hall, where the phone was, to answer it. I heard him talking to someone.
The toast began to smoke under the grill.
I got up on a chair and turned the grill off.
'That was the police,' my father said. 'Someone's reported seeing our car abandoned at the bottom of the lane. I said I hadn't even reported it stolen yet. Right. We can head down now, meet them there. Toast!'
He pulled the pan out from beneath the grill. The toast was smoking and blackened on one side.
'Is my comic there? Or did they steal it?'
'I don't know. The police didn't mention your comic.'
My father put peanut butter on the burnt side of each piece of toast, replaced his dressing gown with a coat worn over his pyjamas, put on a pair of shoes, and we walked down the lane together. He munched his toast as we walked. I held my toast, and did not eat it.
We had walked for perhaps five minutes down the narrow lane, which ran through fields on each side, when a police car came up behind us. It slowed, and the driver greeted my father by name.
I hid my piece of burnt toast behind my back while my father talked to the policeman. I wished my family would buy normal sliced white bread, the kind that went into toasters, like every other family I knew. My father had found a local baker's shop where they made thick loaves of heavy brown bread, and he insisted on buying them. He said they tasted better, which was, to my mind, nonsense. Proper bread was white, and pre-sliced, and tasted like almost nothing: that was the point.
The driver of the police car got out, opened the passenger door, told me to get in. My father rode up front beside the driver.
The police car went slowly down the lane. The whole lane was unpaved back then, just wide enough for one car at a time, a puddly, precipitous, bumpy way, with flints sticking up from it, the whole thing rutted by farm equipment and rain and time.
'These kids,' said the policeman. 'They think it's funny. Steal a car, drive it around, abandon it. They'll be locals.'
'I'm just glad it was found so fast,' said my father.
Past Caraway Farm, where a small girl with hair so blond it was almost white, and red, red cheeks stared at us as we went past. I held my piece of burnt toast on my lap.
'Funny them leaving it down here, though,' said the policeman. 'Because it's a long walk back to anywhere from here.'
We passed a bend in the lane and saw the white Mini over on the side, in front of a gate leading into a field, tyres sunk deep in the brown mud. We drove past it, parked on the grass verge. The policeman let me out, and the three of us walked over to the Mini, while the policeman told my dad about crime in this area, and why it was obviously the local kids who had done it, then my dad was opening the passenger-side door with his spare key.
He said, 'Someone's left something on the back seat.' He reached back and pulled away the blue blanket that covered the thing in the back seat, even as the policeman was telling him that he shouldn't do that, and I was staring at the back seat because that was where my comic was, so I saw it.
It was an it, the thing I was looking at, not a him.
Although I was an imaginative child, prone to nightmares, I had persuaded my parents to take me to Madame Tussauds waxworks in London, when I was six, because I had wanted to visit the Chamber of Horrors, expecting the movie-monster Chambers of Horrors I'd read about in my comics. I had wanted to thrill to waxworks of Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf-man. Instead I was walked through a seemingly endless sequence of dioramas of unremarkable, glum-looking men and women who had murdered people - usually lodgers, and members of their own families - and who were then murdered in their turn: by hanging, by the electric chair, in gas chambers. Most of them were depicted with their victims in awkward social situations - seated around a dinner table, perhaps, as their poisoned family members expired. The plaques that explained who they were also told me that the majority of them had murdered their families and sold the bodies to anatomy. It was then that the word anatomy garnered its own edge of horror for me. I did not know what anatomy was. I knew only that anatomy made people kill their children.
The only thing that had kept me running screaming from the Chamber of Horrors as I was led around it was that none of the waxworks had looked fully convincing. They could not truly look dead, because they did not ever look alive.
The thing in the back seat that had been covered by the blue blanket (I knew that blanket. It was the one that had been in my old bedroom, on the shelf, for when it got cold) was not convincing either. It looked a little like the opal miner, but it was dressed in a black suit, with a white ruffled shirt and a black bow tie. Its hair was slicked back and artificially shiny. Its eyes were staring. Its lips were bluish, but its skin was very red. It looked like a parody of health. There was no gold chain around its neck.
I could see, underneath it, crumpled and bent, my copy of SMASH!, with Batman, looking just as he did on the television, on the cover.
I don't remember who said what then, just that they made me stand away from the Mini. I crossed the road, and I stood there on my own while the policeman talked to my father and wrote things down in a notebook.
I stared at the Mini. A length of green garden hose ran from the exhaust pipe up to the driver's window. There was thick brown mud all over the exhaust, holding the hosepipe in place.
Nobody was watching me. I took a bite of my toast. It was burnt and cold.
At home, my father ate all the most burnt pieces of toast. 'Yum!' he'd say, and 'Charcoal! Good for you!' and 'Burnt toast! My favourite!' and he'd eat it all up. When I was much older, he confessed to me that he had never liked burnt toast, had only eaten it to prevent it from going to waste, and for a fraction of a moment, my entire childhood felt like a lie: it was as if one of the pillars of belief that my world had been built upon had crumbled into dry sand.
The policeman spoke into a radio in the front of his car.
Then he crossed the road and came over to me. 'Sorry about this, sonny,' he said. 'There's going to be a few more cars coming down this road in a minute. We should find you somewhere to wait that you won't be in the way. Would you like to sit in the back of my car again?'
I shook my head. I didn't want to sit there again.
Somebody, a girl, said, 'He can come back with me to the farmhouse. It's no trouble.'
She was much older than me, at least eleven. Her hair was worn relatively short, for a girl, and her nose was snub. She was freckled. She wore a red skirt - girls didn't wear jeans much back then, not in those parts. She had a soft Sussex accent and sharp grey-blue eyes.
The girl went, with the policeman, over to my father, and she got permission to take me away, and then I was walking down the lane with her.
I said, 'There is a dead man in our car.'
'That's why he came down here,' she told me. 'The end of the road. Nobody's going to find him and stop him around here, three o' clock in the morning. And the mud there is wet and easy to mould.'
'Do you think he killed himself?'
'Yes. Do you like milk? Gran's milking Bessie now.'
I said, 'You mean, real milk from a cow?' and then felt foolish, but she nodded, reassuringly.
I thought about this. I'd never had milk that didn't come from a bottle. 'I think I'd like that.'
We stopped at a small barn where an old woman, much older than my parents, with long grey hair, like cobwebs, and a thin face, was standing beside a cow. Long black tubes were attached to each of the cow's teats. 'We used to milk them by hand,' she told me. 'But this is easier.'
She showed me how the milk went from the cow down the black tubes and into the machine, through a cooler and into huge metal churns. The churns were left on a heavy wooden platform outside the barn, where they would be collected each day by a lorry.
The old lady gave me a cup of creamy milk from Bessie the cow, the fresh milk before it had gone through the cooler. Nothing I had drunk had ever tasted like that before: rich and warm and perfectly happy in my mouth. I remembered that milk after I had forgotten everything else.
'There's more of them up the lane,' said the old woman, suddenly. 'All sorts coming down with lights flashing and all. Such a palaver. You should get the boy into the kitchen. He's hungry, and a cup of milk won't do a growing boy.'
The girl said, 'Have you eaten?'
'Just a piece of toast. It was burned.'
She said, 'My name's Lettie. Lettie Hempstock. This is Hempstock Farm. Come on.' She took me in through the front door, and into their enormous kitchen, sat me down at a huge wooden table, so stained and patterned that it looked as if faces were staring up at me from the old wood.
'We have breakfast here early,' she said. 'Milking starts at first light. But there's porridge in the saucepan, and jam to put in it.'
She gave me a china bowl filled with warm porridge from the stove top, with a lump of home-made blackberry jam, my favourite, in the middle of the porridge, then she poured cream on it. I swished it around with my spoon before I ate it, swirling it into a purple mess, and was as happy as I have ever been about anything. It tasted perfect.
A stocky woman came in. Her red-brown hair was streaked with grey, and cut short. She had apple cheeks, a dark green skirt that went to her knees, and wellington boots. She said, 'This must be the boy from the top of the lane. Such a business going on with that car. There'll be five of them needing tea soon.'
Lettie filled a huge copper kettle from the tap. She lit a gas hob with a match and put the kettle on the flame. Then she took down five chipped mugs from a cupboard, and hesitated, looking at the woman. The woman said, 'You're right. Six. The doctor will be here too.'
Then the woman pursed her lips and made a tchutch! noise. 'They've missed the note,' she said. 'He wrote it so carefully too, folded it and put it in his breast pocket, and they haven't looked there yet.'
'What does it say?' asked Lettie.
'Read it yourself,' said the woman. I thought she was Lettie's mother. She seemed like she was somebody's mother. Then she said, 'It says that he took all the money that his friends had given him to smuggle out of South Africa and bank for them in England, along with all the money he'd made over the years mining for opals, and he went to the casino in Brighton, to gamble, but he only meant to gamble with his own money. And then he only meant to dip into the money his friends had given him until he had made back the money he had lost.
'And then he didn't have anything,' said the woman, 'and all was dark.'
'That's not what he wrote, though,' said Lettie, squinting her eyes. 'What he wrote was,
""To all my friends,
Am so sorry it was not like I meant to and hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for I cannot forgive myself.""'
'Same thing,' said the older woman. She turned to me. 'I'm Lettie's ma,' she said. 'You'll have met my mother already, in the milking shed. I'm Mrs Hempstock, but she was Mrs Hempstock before me, so she's Old Mrs Hempstock. This is Hempstock Farm. It's the oldest farm hereabouts. It's in the Domesday Book.'
I wondered why they were all called Hempstock, those women, but I did not ask, any more than I dared to ask how they knew about the suicide note or what the opal miner had thought as he died. They were perfectly matter-of-fact about it.
Lettie said, 'I nudged him to look in the breast pocket. He'll think he thought of it himself.'
'There's a good girl,' said Mrs Hempstock. 'They'll be in here when the kettle boils to ask if I've seen anything unusual and to have their tea. Why don't you take the boy down to the pond?'
'It's not a pond,' said Lettie. 'It's my ocean.' She turned to me and said, 'Come on.' She led me out of the house the way we had come.
The day was still grey.
We walked around the house, down the cow path.
'Is it a real ocean?' I asked.
'Oh yes,' she said.
We came on it suddenly: a wooden shed, an old bench, and between them, a duckpond, dark water spotted with duckweed and lily pads. There was a dead fish, silver as a coin, floating on its side on the surface.
'That's not good,' said Lettie.
'I thought you said it was an ocean,' I told her. 'It's just a pond, really.'
'It is an ocean,' she said. 'We came across it when I was just a baby, from the old country.'
Lettie went into the shed and came out with a long bamboo pole, with what looked like a shrimping net on the end. She leaned over, carefully pushed the net beneath the dead fish. She pulled it out.
'But Hempstock Farm is in the Domesday Book,' I said. 'Your mum said so. And that was William the Conqueror.'
'Yes,' said Lettie Hempstock.
She took the dead fish out of the net and examined it. It was still soft, not stiff, and it flopped in her hand. I had never seen so many colours: it was silver, yes, but beneath the silver was blue and green and purple and each scale was tipped with black.
'What kind of fish is it?' I asked.
'This is very odd,' she said. 'I mean, mostly fish in this ocean don't die anyway.' She produced a horn-handled pocket knife, although I could not have told you from where, and she pushed it into the stomach of the fish, and sliced along, towards the tail.
'This is what killed her,' said Lettie.
She took something from inside the fish. Then she put it, still greasy from the fish guts, into my hand. I bent down, dipped it into the water, rubbed my fingers across it to clean it off. I stared at it. Queen Victoria's face stared back at me.
'Sixpence?' I said. 'The fish ate a sixpence?'
'It's not good, is it?' said Lettie Hempstock. There was a little sunshine now: it showed the freckles that clustered across her cheeks and nose, and where the sunlight touched her hair, it was a coppery red. And then she said, 'Your father's wondering where you are. Time to be getting back.'
I tried to give her the little silver sixpence, but she shook her head. 'You keep it,' she said. 'You can buy chocolates, or sherbet lemons.'
'I don't think I can,' I said. 'It's too small. I don't know if shops will take sixpences like these nowadays.'
'Then put it in your piggy bank,' she said. 'It might bring you luck.' She said this doubtfully, as if she were uncertain what kind of luck it would bring.
The policemen and my father and two men in brown suits and ties were standing in the farmhouse kitchen. One of the men told me he was a policeman, but he wasn't wearing a uniform, which I thought was disappointing: if I were a policeman I would wear my uniform whenever I could. The other man with a suit and tie I recognised as Dr Smithson, our family doctor. They were finishing their tea.
My father thanked Mrs Hempstock and Lettie for taking care of me, and they said I was no trouble at all, and that I could come again. The policeman who had driven us down to the Mini now drove us back to our house, and dropped us off at the end of the drive.
'Probably best if you don't talk about this to your sister,' said my father.
I didn't want to talk about it to anybody. I had found a special place, and made a new friend, and lost my comic, and I was holding an old-fashioned silver sixpence tightly in my hand.
I said, 'What makes the ocean different to the sea?'
'Bigger,' said my father. 'An ocean is much bigger than the sea. Why?'
'Just thinking,' I said. 'Could you have an ocean that was as small as a pond?'
'No,' said my father. 'Ponds are pond-sized, lakes are lake-sized. Seas are seas and oceans are oceans. Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic. I think that's all of the oceans there are.'
My father went up to his bedroom, to talk to my mum and to be on the phone up there. I dropped the silver sixpence into my piggy bank. It was the kind of china piggy bank from which nothing could be removed. One day, when it could hold no more coins, I would be allowed to break it, but it was far from full.
OCEAN_ch3	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	3	3103	16561	I never saw the white Mini again. Two days later, on Monday, my father took delivery of a black Rover, with cracked red leather seats. It was a bigger car than the Mini had been, but not as comfortable. The smell of old cigars permeated the leather upholstery, and long drives in the back of the Rover always left us feeling car-sick.
The black Rover was not the only thing to arrive on Monday morning. I also received a letter.
I was seven years old, and I never got letters. I got cards, on my birthday, from my grandparents, and from Ellen Henderson, my mother's friend whom I did not know. On my birthday Ellen Henderson, who lived in a caravan, would send me a handkerchief. I did not get letters. Even so, I would check the post every day to see if there was anything for me.
And that morning, there was.
I opened it, did not understand what I was looking at, and took it to my mother.
'You've won the Premium Bonds,' she said.
'What does that mean?'
'When you were born - when all of her grandchildren were born - your grandma bought you a Premium Bond. And when the number gets chosen, you can win thousands of pounds.'
'Did I win thousands of pounds?'
'No.' She looked at the slip of paper. 'You've won twenty-five pounds.'
I was sad not to have won thousands of pounds (I already knew what I would buy with it. I would buy a place to go and be alone, like a Batcave, with a hidden entrance), but I was delighted to be in possession of a fortune beyond my previous imaginings. Twenty-five pounds. I could buy four little blackjack or fruit salad sweets for a penny: they were a farthing each, although there were no more farthings. Twenty-five pounds, at 240 pennies to the pound and four sweets to the penny, was ... more sweets than I could easily imagine.
'I'll put it in your Post Office account,' said my mother, crushing my dreams.
I did not have any more sweets than I had had that morning. Even so, I was rich. Thirteen pounds eleven shillings richer than I had been moments before. I had never won anything, ever.
I made her show me the piece of paper with my name on it again, before she put it into her handbag.
That was Monday morning. In the afternoon, the ancient Mr Wollery, who came in on Monday and Thursday afternoons to do some gardening (Mrs Wollery, his equally ancient wife, who wore galoshes, huge semi-transparent overshoes, would come in on Wednesday afternoons and clean), was digging in the vegetable garden and dug up a bottle filled with pennies and halfpennies and threepenny bits and even farthings. None of the coins was dated later than 1937, and I spent the afternoon polishing them with brown sauce and vinegar, to make them shine.
My mother put the bottle of old coins on the mantelpiece of the dining room, and said that she expected that a coin collector might pay several pounds for them.
I went to bed that night happy and excited. I was rich. Buried treasure had been discovered. The world was a good place.
I don't remember how the dreams started. But that's the way of dreams, isn't it? I know that I was in school, and having a bad day, hiding from the kinds of kids who hit me and called me names, but they found me anyway, deep in the rhododendron thicket behind the school, and I knew it must be a dream (but in the dream I didn't know; it was real and it was true) because my grandfather was with them, and his friends, old men with grey skin and hacking coughs. They held sharp pencils, the kind that drew blood when you were jabbed with them. I ran from them, but they were faster than I was, the old men, and the big boys, and in the boys' toilets, where I had hidden in a cubicle, they caught up with me. They held me down, forced my mouth wide open.
My grandfather (but it was not my grandfather; it was really a waxwork of my grandfather, intent on selling me to anatomy) held something sharp and glittering, and he began pushing it into my mouth with his stubby fingers. It was hard and sharp and familiar, and it made me gag and choke. My mouth filled with a metallic taste.
They were looking at me with mean, triumphant eyes, all the people in the boys' toilets, and I tried not to choke on the thing in my throat, determined not to give them that satisfaction.
I woke and I was choking.
I could not breathe. There was something in my throat, hard and sharp and stopping me from breathing or from crying out. I began to cough as I woke, tears streaming down my cheeks, nose running.
I pushed my fingers as deeply as I could into my mouth, desperate and panicked and determined. I felt the edge of something hard with the tip of my forefinger, put the middle finger on the other side of it, choking myself, clamping the thing between them, and I pulled whatever it was out of my throat.
I gasped for breath, and then I half vomited on to my bedsheets, threw up a clear drool flecked with blood, from where the thing had cut my throat as I had pulled it out.
I did not look at the thing. It was tight in my hand, slimy with my saliva and my phlegm. I did not want to look at it. I did not want it to exist, the bridge between my dream and the waking world.
I ran down the hallway to the bathroom, at the far end of the house. I washed my mouth out, drank directly from the cold tap, spat red into the white sink. Only when I'd done that did I sit on the side of the white bathtub and open my hand. I was scared.
But what was in my hand - what had been in my throat - wasn't scary. It was a coin: a silver shilling.
I went back to the bedroom. I dressed myself, cleaned the vomit from my sheets as best I could with a damp face flannel. I hoped that the sheets would dry before I had to sleep in the bed that night. Then I went downstairs.
I wanted to tell someone about the shilling, but I did not know who to tell. I knew enough about adults to know that if I did tell them what had happened, I would not be believed. Adults rarely seemed to believe me when I told the truth anyway. Why would they believe me about something so unlikely?
My sister was playing in the back garden with some of her friends. She ran over to me angrily when she saw me. She said, 'I hate you. I'm telling Mummy and Daddy when they come home.'
'What?'
'You know,' she said. 'I know it was you.'
'What was me?'
'Throwing coins at me. At all of us. From the bushes. That was just nasty.'
'But I didn't.'
'It hurt.'
She went back to her friends, and they all glared at me. My throat felt painful and ragged.
I walked down the drive. I don't know where I was thinking of going - I just didn't want to be there any longer.
Lettie Hempstock was standing at the bottom of the drive, beneath the chestnut trees. She looked as if she had been waiting for a hundred years and could wait for another hundred. She wore a white dress, but the light coming through the chestnut's young spring leaves stained it green.
I said, 'Hello.'
She said, 'You were having bad dreams, weren't you?'
I took the shilling out of my pocket and showed it to her. 'I was choking on it,' I told her. 'When I woke up. But I don't know how it got into my mouth. If someone had put it into my mouth, I would have woken up. It was just in there, when I woke.'
'Yes,' she said.
'My sister says I threw coins at them from the bushes, but I didn't.'
'No,' she agreed. 'You didn't.'
I said, 'Lettie? What's happening?'
'Oh,' she said, as if it was obvious. 'Someone's just trying to give people money, that's all. But it's doing it very badly, and it's stirring things up around here that should be asleep. And that's not good.'
'Is it something to do with the man who died?'
'Something to do with him. Yes.'
'Is he doing this?'
She shook her head. Then she said, 'Have you had breakfast?'
I shook my head.
'Well then,' she said. 'Come on.'
We walked down the lane together. There were a few houses down the lane, here and there, back then, and she pointed to them as we went past. 'In that house,' said Lettie Hempstock, 'a man dreamed of being sold and of being turned into money. Now he's started seeing things in mirrors.'
'What kinds of things?'
'Himself. But with fingers poking out of his eye sockets. And things coming out of his mouth. Like crab claws.'
I thought about people with crab legs coming out of their mouths, in mirrors. 'Why did I find a shilling in my throat?'
'He wanted people to have money.'
'The opal miner? Who died in the car?'
'Yes. Sort of. Not exactly. He started this all off, like someone lighting a fuse on a firework. His death lit the touchpaper. The thing that's exploding right now, that isn't him. That's somebody else. Something else.'
She rubbed her freckled nose with a grubby hand.
'A lady's gone mad in that house,' she told me, and it would not have occurred to me to doubt her. 'She has money in the mattress. Now she won't get out of bed, in case someone takes it from her.'
'How do you know?'
She shrugged. 'Once you've been around for a bit, you get to know stuff.'
I kicked a stone. 'By ""a bit"", do you mean ""a really long time""?'
She nodded.
'How old are you, really?' I asked.
'Eleven.'
I thought for a while. Then I asked, 'How long have you been eleven for?'
She smiled at me.
We walked past Caraway Farm. The farmers, whom one day I would come to know as Callie Anders' parents, were standing in their farmyard, shouting at each other. They stopped when they saw us.
When we rounded a bend in the lane, and were out of sight, Lettie said, 'Those poor people.'
'Why are they poor people?'
'Because they've been having money problems. And this morning he had a dream where she ... she was doing bad things. To earn money. So he looked in her handbag and found lots of folded-up ten-shilling notes. She says she doesn't know where they came from, and he doesn't believe her. He doesn't know what to believe.'
'All the fighting and the dreams. It's about money, isn't it?'
'I'm not sure,' said Lettie, and she seemed so grown-up then that I was almost scared of her.
'Whatever's happening,' she said, eventually, 'it can all be sorted out.' She saw the expression on my face then, worried. Scared even. And she said, 'After pancakes.'
Lettie cooked us pancakes on a big metal griddle, on the kitchen stove. They were paper thin, and as each pancake was done, Lettie would squeeze lemon on to it, and plop a blob of plum jam into the centre, and roll it tightly, like a cigar. When there were enough, we sat at the kitchen table and wolfed them down.
There was a hearth in that kitchen, and there were ashes still smouldering in the hearth, from the night before. That kitchen was a friendly place, I thought.
I said to Lettie, 'I'm scared.'
She smiled at me. 'I'll make sure you're safe. I promise. I'm not scared.'
I was still scared, but not as much. 'It's just scary.'
'I said I promise,' said Lettie Hempstock. 'I won't let you be hurt.'
'Hurt?' said a high, cracked voice. 'Who's hurt? What's been hurt? Why would anybody be hurt?'
It was old Mrs Hempstock, her apron held between her hands, and in the hollow of the apron so many daffodils that the light reflected up from them transformed her face to gold, and the kitchen seemed bathed in yellow light.
Lettie said, 'Something's causing trouble. It's giving people money. In their dreams and in real life.' She showed the old lady my shilling. 'My friend found himself choking on this shilling when he woke up this morning.'
Old Mrs Hempstock put her apron on the kitchen table, rapidly moved the daffodils off the cloth and on to the wood. Then she took the shilling from Lettie. She squinted at it, sniffed it, rubbed at it, listened to it (or put it to her ear, at any rate), then touched it with the tip of her purple tongue.
'It's new,' she said, at last. 'It says 1912 on it, but it didn't exist yesterday.'
Lettie said, 'I knew there was something funny about it.'
I looked up at old Mrs Hempstock. 'How do you know?'
'Good question, luvvie. It's electron decay, mostly. You have to look at things closely to see the electrons. They're the little dinky ones that look like tiny smiles. The neutrons are the grey ones that look like frowns. The electrons were all a bit too smiley for 1912, so then I checked the sides of the letters and the old King's head, and everything was a tad too crisp and sharp. Even where they were worn, it was as if they'd been made to be worn.'
'You must have very good eyesight,' I told her. I was impressed. She gave me back the coin.
'Not as good as it once was, but then, when you get to be my age, your eyesight won't be as sharp as it once was, neither.' And she let out a guffaw as if she had said something very funny.
'How old is that?'
Lettie looked at me, and I was worried that I'd said something rude. Sometimes adults didn't like to be asked their ages, and sometimes they did. In my experience, old people did. They were proud of their ages. Mrs Wollery was seventy-seven, and Mr Wollery was eighty-nine, and they liked telling us how old they were.
Old Mrs Hempstock went over to a cupboard, and took out several colourful vases. 'Old enough,' she said. 'I remember when the moon was made.'
'Hasn't there always been a moon?'
'Bless you. Not in the slightest. I remember the day the moon came. We looked up in the sky - it was all dirty brown and sooty grey here then, not green and blue ...' She half filled each of the vases at the sink. Then she took a pair of blackened kitchen scissors, and snipped off the bottom half-inch of stem from each of the daffodils.
I said, 'Are you sure it's not that man's ghost doing this? Are you sure we aren't being haunted?'
They both laughed then, the girl and the old woman, and I felt stupid. I said, 'Sorry.'
'Ghosts can't make things,' said Lettie. 'They aren't even good at moving things.'
Old Mrs Hempstock said, 'Go and get your mother. She's doing laundry.' Then, to me, 'You shall help me with the daffs.'
I helped her put the flowers into the vases, and she asked my opinion on where to put the vases in the kitchen. We placed them where I suggested, and I felt wonderfully important.
The daffodils sat like patches of sunlight, making that dark wooden kitchen even more cheerful. The floor was red flagstone. The walls were whitewashed.
The old woman gave me a lump of honeycomb, from the Hempstocks' own beehive, on a chipped saucer, and poured a little cream over it from a jug. I ate it with a spoon, chewing the wax like gum, letting the honey flow into my mouth, sweet and sticky with an aftertaste of wild flowers.
I was scraping the last of the cream and honey from the saucer when Lettie and her mother came into the kitchen. Mrs Hempstock still had big wellington boots on, and she strode in as if she were in an enormous hurry. 'Mother!' she said. 'Giving the boy honey. You'll rot his teeth.'
Old Mrs Hempstock shrugged. 'I'll have a word with the wigglers in his mouth,' she said. 'Get them to leave his teeth alone.'
'You can't just boss bacteria around like that,' said the younger Mrs Hempstock. 'They don't like it.'
'Stuff and silliness,' said the old lady. 'You leave wigglers alone and they'll be carrying on like anything. Show them who's boss and they can't do enough for you. You've tasted my cheese.' She turned to me. 'I've won medals for my cheese. Medals. Back in the old King's day there were those who'd ride for a week to buy a round of my cheese. They said that the King himself had it with his bread, and his boys, Prince Dickon and Prince Geoffrey and even little Prince John, they swore it was the finest cheese they had ever tasted ...'
'Gran,' said Lettie, and the old lady stopped, mid flow.
Lettie's mother said, 'You'll be needing a hazel wand. And,' she added, somewhat doubtfully, 'I suppose you could take the lad. It's his coin, and it'll be easier to carry if he's with you. Something she made.'
'She?' said Lettie. She was holding her horn-handled penknife, with the blade closed.
'Tastes like a she,' said Lettie's mother. 'I might be wrong, mind.'
'Don't take the boy,' said Old Mrs Hempstock. 'Asking for trouble, that is.'
I was disappointed.
'We'll be fine,' said Lettie. 'I'll take care of him. Him and me. It'll be an adventure. And he'll be company. Please, Gran?'
I looked up at Old Mrs Hempstock with hope on my face, and waited.
'Don't say I didn't warn you, if it all goes wobbly,' said Old Mrs Hempstock.
'Thank you, Gran. I won't. And I'll be careful.'
Old Mrs Hempstock sniffed. 'Now, don't do anything stupid. Approach it with care. Bind it, close its ways, send it back to sleep.'
'I know,' said Lettie. 'I know all that. Honestly. We'll be fine.'
That's what she said. But we weren't.
OCEAN_ch4	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	4	3212	17016	Lettie led me to a hazel thicket beside the old road (the hazel catkins were hanging heavy in the spring) and broke off a branch. Then, with her knife, as if she had done it ten thousand times before, she stripped it of bark and cut it again so that now it resembled a Y. She put the knife away (I did not see where it went) and held the two ends of the Y in her hands.
'I'm not dowsing,' she told me. 'Just using it as a guide. We're looking for a blue ... a blue bottle, I think to start with. Or something purply-blue, and shiny.'
I looked around with her. 'I can't see one.'
'It'll be here,' she assured me.
I gazed around, taking in the grass, a reddish-brown chicken pecking at the side of the driveway, some rusty farm machinery, the wooden trestle table beside the road and the six empty metal milk churns that sat upon it. I saw the Hempstocks' red-brick farmhouse, crouched and comfortable like an animal at rest. I saw the spring flowers; the omnipresent white and yellow daisies, the golden dandelions and do-you-like-butter buttercups, and, late in the season, a lone bluebell in the shadows beneath the milk-churn table, still glistening with dew ...
'That?' I asked.
'You've got sharp eyes,' she said, approvingly.
We walked together to the bluebell. Lettie closed her eyes when we reached it. She moved her body back and forth, the hazel wand extended, as if she were the central point on a clock or a compass, her wand the hands, orienting towards a midnight or an East that I could not perceive. 'Black,' she said suddenly, as if she were describing something from a dream. 'And soft.'
We walked away from the bluebell, along the lane that I imagined, sometimes, must have been a Roman road. We were a hundred yards up the lane, near where the Mini had been parked, when she spotted it: a scrap of black cloth caught on the barbed wire of the fence.
Lettie approached it. Again the outstretched hazel stick, again the slow turning and turning. 'Red,' she said, with certainty. 'Very red. That way.'
We walked together in the direction she indicated. Across a meadow and into a clump of trees. 'There,' I said, fascinated. The corpse of a very small animal - a vole, by the look of it - lay on a clump of green moss. It had no head, and bright blood stained its fur and beaded on the moss. It was very red.
'Now, from here on,' said Lettie, 'hold on to my arm. Don't let go.'
I put out my right hand and took her left arm, just below the elbow. She moved the hazel wand. 'This way,' she said.
'What are we looking for now?'
'We're getting closer,' she said. 'The next thing we're looking for is a storm.'
We pushed our way into a clump of trees, and through the clump of trees into a wood, and squeezed our way through trees too close together, their foliage a thick canopy above our heads. We found a clearing in the wood, and walked along the clearing, in a world made green.
From our left came a mumble of distant thunder.
'Storm,' sang Lettie. She let her body swing again, and I turned with her, holding her arm. I felt, or imagined I felt, a throbbing going through me, holding her arm, as if I were touching mighty engines.
She set off in a new direction. We crossed a tiny stream together. Then she stopped, suddenly, and stumbled, but did not fall.
'Are we there?' I asked.
'Not there,' she said. 'No. It knows we're coming. It feels us. And it does not want us to come to it.'
The hazel wand was whipping around now like a magnet being pushed at a repelling pole. Lettie grinned.
A gust of wind threw leaves and dirt up into our faces. In the distance I could hear something rumble, like a train. It was getting harder to see, and the sky that I could make out above the canopy of leaves was dark, as if huge storm clouds had moved above our heads, or as if it had gone from morning directly to twilight.
Lettie shouted, 'Get down!' and she crouched on the moss, pulling me down with her. She lay prone, and I lay beside her, feeling a little silly. The ground was damp.
'How long will we ...?'
'Shush!' She sounded almost angry. I said nothing.
Something came through the woods, above our heads. I glanced up, saw something brown and furry, but flat, like a huge rug, flapping and curling at the edges, and at the front of the rug, a mouth, filled with dozens of tiny sharp teeth, facing down.
It flapped and floated above us, and then it was gone.
'What was that?' I asked, my heart pounding so hard in my chest that I did not know if I would be able to stand again.
'Manta wolf,' said Lettie. 'We've already gone a bit further out than I thought.' She got to her feet and stared the way the furry thing had gone. She raised the tip of the hazel wand, and turned around slowly.
'I'm not getting anything.' She tossed her head, to get the hair out of her eyes, without letting go of the forks of the hazel wand. 'Either it's hiding or we're too close.' She bit her lip. Then she said, 'The shilling. The one from your throat. Bring it out.'
I took it from my pocket with my left hand, offered it to her.
'No,' she said. 'I can't touch it, not right now. Put it down on the fork of the stick.'
I didn't ask why. I just put the silver shilling down at the intersection of the Y. Lettie stretched her arms out, and turned very slowly, with the end of the stick pointing straight out. I moved with her, but felt nothing. No throbbing engines. We were over halfway around when she stopped and said, 'Look!'
I looked in the direction she was facing, but I saw nothing but trees, and shadows in the wood.
'No, look. There.' She indicated with her head.
The tip of the hazel wand had begun smoking, softly. She turned a little to the left, a little to the right, a little further to the right again, and the tip of the wand began to glow a bright orange.
'That's something I've not seen before,' said Lettie. 'I'm using the coin as an amplifier, but it's as if-'
There was a whoompf! and the end of the stick burst into flame. Lettie pushed it down into the damp moss. She said, 'Take your coin back,' and I did, picking it up carefully, in case it was hot, but it was icy cold. She left the hazel wand behind on the moss, the charcoal tip of it still smoking irritably.
Lettie walked and I walked beside her. We held hands now, my right hand in her left. The air smelled strange, like fireworks, and the world grew darker with every step we took into the forest.
'I said I'd keep you safe, didn't I?' said Lettie.
'Yes.'
'I promised I wouldn't let anything hurt you.'
'Yes.'
She said, 'Just keep holding my hand. Don't let go. Whatever happens, don't let go.'
Her hand was warm, but not sweaty. It was reassuring.
'Hold my hand,' she repeated. 'And don't do anything unless I tell you. You've got that?'
I said, 'I don't feel very safe.'
She did not argue. She said, 'We've gone further than I imagined. Further than I expected. I'm not really sure what kinds of things live out here on the margins.'
The trees ended, and we walked out into open country.
I said, 'Are we a long way from your farm?'
'No. We're still on the borders of the farm. Hempstock Farm stretches a very long way. We brought a lot of this with us from the old country, when we came here. The farm came with us, and brought things with it when it came. Gran calls them fleas.'
I did not know where we were, but I could not believe we were still on the Hempstocks' land, no more than I believed we were in the world I had grown up in. The sky of this place was the dull orange of a warning light; the plants, which were spiky, like huge, ragged aloes, were a dark silvery green, and looked as if they had been beaten from gun-metal.
The coin, in my left hand, which had warmed to the heat of my body, began to cool down again, until it was as cold as an ice cube. My right hand held Lettie Hempstock's hand as tightly as it could.
She said, 'We're here.'
I thought I was looking at a building at first: that it was some kind of tent, as high as a country church, made of grey and pink canvas that flapped in the gusts of storm wind, in that orange sky: a lopsided canvas structure aged by weather and ripped by time.
And then it turned and I saw its face, and I heard something make a whimpering sound, like a dog that had been kicked, and I realised that the thing that was whimpering was me.
Its face was ragged, and its eyes were deep holes in the fabric. There was nothing behind it, just a grey canvas mask, huger than I could have imagined, all ripped and torn, blowing in the gusts of storm wind.
Something shifted, and the ragged thing looked down at us.
Lettie Hempstock said, 'Name yourself.'
There was a pause. Empty eyes stared down. Then a voice as featureless as the wind said, 'I am the lady of this place. I have been here for such a long time. Since before the little people sacrificed each other on the rocks. My name is my own, child. Not yours. Now leave me be, before I blow you all away.' It gestured with a limb like a broken mainsail, and I felt myself shivering.
Lettie Hempstock squeezed my hand and I felt braver. She said, 'Asked you to name yourself, I did. I en't heard more'n empty boasts of age and time. Now, you tell me your name and I en't asking you a third time.' She sounded more like a country girl than she ever had before. Perhaps it was the anger in her voice: her words came out differently when she was angry.
'No,' whispered the grey thing, flatly. 'Little girl, little girl ... who's your friend?'
Lettie whispered, 'Don't say nothing.' I nodded, pressed my lips tightly together.
'I am growing tired of this,' said the grey thing, with a petulant shake of its ragged-cloth arms. 'Something came to me, and pleaded for love and help. It told me how I could make all the things like it happy. That they are simple creatures, and all any of them want is money, just money, and nothing more. Little tokens of work. If it had asked, I would have given them wisdom, or peace, perfect peace ...'
'None of that,' said Lettie Hempstock. 'You've got nothing to give them that they want. Let them be.'
The wind gusted and the gargantuan figure flapped with it, like huge sails swinging, and when the wind was done the creature had changed position. Now it seemed to have crouched lower to the ground, and it was examining us like an enormous canvas scientist looking at two white mice.
Two very scared white mice, holding hands.
Lettie's hand was sweating, now. She squeezed my hand, whether to reassure me or herself I did not know, and I squeezed back.
The ripped face, the place where the face should have been, twisted. I thought it was smiling. Perhaps it was smiling. I felt as if it was examining me, taking me apart. As if it knew everything about me - things I did not even know about myself.
The girl holding my hand said, 'If you en't telling me your name, I'll bind you as a nameless thing. And you'll still be bounden, tied and sealed like a polter or a shuck.'
She waited, but the thing said nothing, and Lettie Hempstock began to say words in a language I did not know. Sometimes she was talking, and sometimes it was more like singing, in a tongue that was nothing I had ever heard, or would ever encounter later in life. I knew the tune, though. It was a child's song, the tune to which we sang the nursery rhyme 'Girls and Boys Come Out to Play'. That was the tune, but her words were older words. I was certain of that.
And as she sang, things happened, beneath the orange sky.
The earth writhed and churned with worms, long grey worms that pushed up from the ground beneath our feet.
Something came hurtling at us from the centre mass of flapping canvas. It was a little bigger than a football. At school, during games, mostly I dropped things I was meant to catch, or closed my hand on them a moment too late, letting them hit me in the face or the stomach. But this thing was coming straight at me and Lettie Hempstock, and I did not think, I only did.
I put both my hands out and I caught the thing, a flapping, writhing mass of cobwebs and rotting cloth. And as I caught it in my hands I felt something hurt me: a stabbing pain in the sole of my foot, momentary and then gone, as if I had trodden upon a pin.
Lettie knocked the thing I was holding out of my hands, and it fell to the ground, where it collapsed into itself. She grabbed my right hand, held it firmly once more. And through all this, she continued to sing.
I have dreamed of that song, of the strange words to that simple rhyme-song, and on several occasions I have understood what she was saying, in my dreams. In those dreams I spoke that language too, the first language, and I had dominion over the nature of all that was real. In my dream, it was the tongue of what is, and anything spoken in it becomes real, because nothing said in that language can be a lie. It is the most basic building brick of everything. In my dreams I have used that language to heal the sick and to fly; once I dreamed I kept a perfect little bed and breakfast by the seaside, and to everyone who came to stay with me I would say, in that tongue, 'Be whole,' and they would become whole, not be broken people, not any longer, because I had spoken the language of shaping.
And because Lettie was speaking the language of shaping, even if I did not understand what she was saying, I understood what was being said. The thing in the clearing was being bound to that place for always, trapped, forbidden to exercise its influence on anything beyond its own domain.
Lettie Hempstock finished singing.
In my mind, I thought I could hear the creature screaming, protesting, railing, but the place beneath that orange sky was quiet, only the flapping of canvas and the rattle of twigs in the wind breaking the silence.
The wind died down.
A thousand pieces of torn grey cloth settled on the black earth like dead things, or like so much abandoned laundry. Nothing moved.
Lettie said, 'That should hold it.' She squeezed my hand. I thought she was trying to sound bright, but she didn't. She sounded grim. 'Let's take you home.'
We walked, hand in hand, through a wood of blue-tinged evergreens, and we crossed a lacquered red and yellow bridge over an ornamental pond; we walked along the edge of a field in which young corn was coming up, like green grass planted in rows; we climbed a wooden stile, hand in hand, and reached another field, planted with what looked like small reeds or furry snakes, black and white and brown and orange and grey and striped, all of them waving gently, curling and uncurling in the sun.
'What are they?' I asked.
'You can pull one up and see, if you like,' said Lettie.
I looked down: the furry tendril by my feet was perfectly black. I bent, grasped it at the base, firmly, with my left hand, and I pulled.
Something came up from the earth, and swung around angrily. My hand felt like a dozen tiny needles had been sunk into it. I brushed the earth from it, and apologised, and it stared at me, more with surprise and puzzlement than with anger. It jumped from my hand to my shirt, I stroked it: a kitten, black and sleek, with a pointed, inquisitive face, a white spot over one ear, and eyes of a peculiarly vivid blue-green.
'At the farm, we get our cats the normal way,' said Lettie.
'What's that?'
'Big Oliver. He turned up at the farm back in pagan times. All our farm cats trace back to him.'
I looked at the kitten hanging on my shirt with tiny kitten claws.
'Can I take it home?' I asked.
'It's not an it. It's a she. Not a good idea, taking anything home from these parts,' said Lettie.
I put the kitten down at the edge of the field. She darted off after a butterfly, which floated up and out of reach, then scampered away, without a look back.
'My kitten was run over,' I told Lettie. 'It was only little. The man who died told me about it, although he wasn't driving. He said they didn't see it.'
'I'm sorry,' said Lettie. We were walking beneath a canopy of apple blossom then, and the world smelled like honey. 'That's the trouble with living things. Don't last very long. Kittens one day, old cats the next. And then just memories. And the memories fade and blend and smudge together ...'
She opened a five-bar gate, and we went through it. She let go of my hand. We were at the bottom of the lane, near the wooden shelf by the road with the battered silver milk churns on it. The world smelled normal.
I said, 'We're really back now?'
'Yes,' said Lettie Hempstock. 'And we won't be seeing any more trouble from her.' She paused. 'Big, wasn't she? And nasty? I've not seen one like that before. If I'd known she was going to be so old, and so big, and so nasty, I would've left you behind.'
I was glad that she had taken me with her.
Then she said, 'I wish you hadn't let go of my hand. But still, you're all right, aren't you? Nothing went wrong. No damage done.'
I said, 'I'm fine. Not to worry. I'm a brave soldier.' That was what my grandfather always said. Then I said, 'No damage done.'
She smiled at me, a bright, relieved smile, and I hoped I had said the right thing.
OCEAN_ch5	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	5	1199	6064	That evening my sister sat on her bed, brushing her hair over and over. She brushed it a hundred times every night, and counted each brush stroke. I did not know why.
'What are you doing?' she asked.
'Looking at my foot,' I told her.
I was staring at the sole of my right foot. There was a pink line across the centre of the sole, from the ball of the foot almost to the heel, where I had stepped on a broken glass as a toddler. I remember waking up in my cot, the morning after it happened, looking at the black stitches that held the edges of the cut together. It was my earliest memory. I was used to the pink scar. The little hole beside it, in the arch of my foot, was new. It was where the sudden sharp pain had been, although it did not hurt. It was just a hole.
I prodded it with my forefinger, and it seemed to me that something inside the hole retreated.
My sister had stopped brushing her hair and was watching me curiously. I got up, walked out of the bedroom, down the corridor, to the bathroom at the end of the hall.
I do not know why I did not ask an adult about it. I do not remember asking adults about anything, except as a last resort. That was the year I dug out a wart from my knee with a penknife, discovering how deeply I could cut before it hurt, and what the roots of a wart looked like.
In the bathroom cupboard, behind the mirror, was a pair of stainless-steel tweezers, the kind with pointed, sharp tips, for pulling out wooden splinters, and a box of sticking plasters. I sat on the metal side of the white bathtub and examined the hole in my foot. It was a simple, small round hole, smooth-edged. I could not see how deeply it went, because something was in the way. Something was blocking it. Something that seemed to retreat as the light touched it.
I held the tweezers, and I watched. Nothing happened. Nothing changed.
I put the forefinger of my left hand over the hole, gently, blocking the light. Then I put the tip of the tweezers beside the hole and I waited. I counted to a hundred - inspired, perhaps, by my sister's hair brushing. Then I pulled my finger away and stabbed in with the tweezers.
I caught the head of the worm, if that was what it was, by the tip, between the metal prongs, and I squeezed it, and I pulled.
Have you ever tried to pull a worm from a hole? You know how hard they can hold on? The way they use their whole bodies to grip the sides of the hole? I pulled perhaps an inch of this worm - pink and grey, streaked, like something infected - out of the hole in my foot, and then felt it stop. I could feel it, inside my flesh, making itself rigid, unpullable. I was not scared by this. It was obviously just something that happened to people, like when the neighbour's cat, Misty, had worms. I had a worm in my foot, and I was removing the worm.
I twisted the tweezers, thinking, I suspect, of spaghetti on a fork, winding the worm around the tweezers. It tried to pull back, but I turned it, a little at a time, until I could definitely pull no further.
I could feel, inside me, the sticky plastic way that it tried to hold on, like a strip of pure muscle. I leaned over, as far as I could, reached out my left hand and turned on the bath's hot tap, the one with the red dot in the centre, and I let it run. The water ran for three, four minutes out of the tap and down the plughole before it began to steam.
When the water was steaming, I extended my foot and my right arm, maintaining pressure on the tweezers and on the inch of the creature that I had wound out of my body. Then I put the place where the tweezers were under the hot tap. The water splashed my foot, but my soles were barefoot-hardened, and I scarcely minded. The water that touched my fingers scalded them, but I was prepared for the heat. The worm wasn't. I felt it flex inside me, trying to pull back from the scalding water, felt it loosen its grip on the inside of my foot. I turned the tweezers, triumphantly, like picking the best scab in the world, as the creature began to come out of me, putting up less and less resistance.
I pulled at it, steadily, and as it went under the hot water it slackened, until it was almost all out of me. But I was too confident, too triumphant, and impatient, and I tugged too quickly, too hard, and the worm came off in my hand. The end of it that came out of me was oozing and broken, as if it had snapped off.
Still, if the creature had left anything in my foot, it was tiny.
I examined the worm. It was dark grey and light grey, streaked with pink, and segmented, like a normal earthworm. Now it was out of the hot water, it seemed to be recovering. The body that had been wrapped around the tweezers now dangled, writhing, hanging from the head (was it its head? How could I tell?) where I had pinched it.
I did not want to kill it - I did not kill animals, not if I could help it - but I had to get rid of it. It was dangerous. I had no doubt of that.
I held the worm above the bath's plughole, where it wriggled under the scalding water. Then I let it go, and watched it vanish down the drain. I let the water run for a while, and I washed off the tweezers. Then I put a small sticking plaster over the hole in the sole of my foot, and put the plug in the bath, to prevent the worm from climbing back up the open plughole, before I turned off the tap. I did not know if it was dead, but I did not think you came back from the drain.
I put the tweezers back where I had got them from, behind the bathroom mirror, then I closed the mirror and stared at myself.
I wondered, as I wondered so often when I was that age, who I was, and what exactly was looking at the face in the mirror. If the face I was looking at wasn't me, and I knew it wasn't, because I would still be me whatever happened to my face, then what was me? And what was watching?
I went back to the bedroom. It was my night to have the door to the hallway open, and I waited until my sister was asleep, and wouldn't tell on me, and then, in the dim light from the hall, I read a Secret Seven mystery until I fell asleep.
OCEAN_ch6	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	6	4262	22581	An admission about myself: as a very small boy, perhaps three or four years old, I could be a monster. 'You were a little momzer,' several aunts told me, on different occasions, once I had safely reached adulthood and my dreadful infant deeds could be recalled with wry amusement. But I do not actually remember being a monster. I just remember wanting my own way.
Small children believe themselves to be gods, or some of them do, and they can only be satisfied when the rest of the world goes along with their way of seeing things.
But I was no longer a small boy. I was seven. I had been fearless, but now I was such a frightened child.
The incident of the worm in my foot did not scare me. I did not talk about it. I wondered, though, the next day, whether people often got foot-worms, or whether it was something that had only ever happened to me, in the orange-sky place on the edge of the Hempstocks' farm.
I peeled off the plaster on the sole of my foot when I awoke, and was relieved to see that the hole had begun to close up. There was a pink place where it had been, like a blood blister, but nothing more.
I went down to breakfast. My mother looked happy. She said, 'Good news, darling. I've got a job. They need an optometrist at Dicksons Opticians, and they want me to start this afternoon. I'll be working four days a week.'
I did not mind. I would be fine on my own.
'And I've got more good news. We have someone coming to look after you children while I'm away. Her name is Ursula. She'll be sleeping in your old bedroom, at the top of the stairs. She'll be a sort of housekeeper. She'll make sure you children are fed, and she'll clean the house - Mrs Wollery is having trouble with her hip, and she says it will be a few weeks before she can come back. It will be such a load off my mind to have someone here, if Daddy and I are both working.'
'You don't have the money,' I said. 'You said you didn't have any money.'
'That's why I'm taking the optometrist job,' she said. 'And Ursula's looking after you for room and board. She needs to live locally for a few months. She phoned this morning. Her references are excellent.'
I hoped that she would be nice. The previous housekeeper, Gertruda, six months earlier, had not been nice: she had enjoyed playing practical jokes on my sister and me, of the apple-pie-bed variety, which left us baffled. Eventually we had marched outside the house with placards saying 'We hate Gertruda' and 'We do not like Gertruda's cooking', and put tiny frogs in her bed, and she had gone back to Sweden.
I took a book and went out into the garden.
It was a warm spring day, and sunny, and I climbed up a rope ladder to the lowest branch of the big beech tree, sat on it, and read my book. I was not scared of anything when I read my book: I was far away, in ancient Egypt, learning about Hathor, and how she had stalked Egypt in the form of a lioness, and killed so many people that the sands of Egypt turned red, and how they had only defeated her by mixing beer and honey and sleeping draughts, and dying this concoction red, so she thought it was blood, and she drank it, and fell asleep. Ra, the father of the gods, made her the goddess of love after that, so the wounds she had inflicted on people would now only be wounds of the heart.
I wondered why the gods had done that. Why they hadn't just killed her, when they had the chance.
I liked myths. They weren't adult stories and they weren't children's stories. They were better than that. They just were.
Adult stories never made sense, and they were so slow to start. They made me feel like there were secrets, masonic, mythic secrets, to adulthood. Why didn't adults want to read about Narnia, about secret islands and smugglers and dangerous fairies?
I was getting hungry. I climbed down from my tree, and went to the back of the house, past the laundry room that smelled of laundry soap and mildew, past the little coal and wood shed, past the outside toilet where the spiders hung and waited, wooden doors painted garden green. In through the back door, along the hallway and into the kitchen.
My mother was in there with a woman I had never seen before. When I saw her, my heart hurt. I mean that literally, not metaphorically: there was a momentary twinge in my chest, just a flash, and then it was gone.
My sister was sitting at the kitchen table, eating a bowl of cereal.
The woman was very pretty. She had shortish honey-blond hair, huge grey-blue eyes, and pale lipstick. She seemed tall, even for an adult.
'Darling? This is Ursula Monkton,' said my mother. I said nothing. I just stared at her. My mother nudged me.
'Hello,' I said.
'He's shy,' said Ursula Monkton. 'I am certain that once he warms up to me we shall be great friends.' She reached out a hand and patted my sister's mousy-brown hair. My sister smiled a gap-toothed smile.
'I like you so much,' my sister said. Then she said, to our mother and me, 'When I grow up I want to be Ursula Monkton.'
My mother and Ursula laughed. 'You little dear,' said Ursula Monkton. Then she turned to me. 'And what about us, eh? Are we friends as well?'
I just looked at her, all grown-up and blonde, in her grey and pink dress, and I was scared.
Her dress wasn't ragged. It was just the fashion of the thing, I suppose, the kind of dress that it was. But when I looked at her, I imagined her dress flapping, in that windless kitchen, flapping like the mainsail of a ship, on a lonely ocean, under an orange sky.
I don't know what I said in reply, or if I even said anything. But I went out of that kitchen, although I was hungry, without even an apple.
I took my book into the back garden, beneath the balcony, by the flower bed under the television-room window, and I read - forgetting my hunger in Egypt with animal-headed gods who cut each other up and then restored one another to life again.
My sister came out into the garden.
'I like her so much,' she told me. 'She's my friend. Do you want to see what she gave me?' She produced a small grey purse, the kind my mother kept in her handbag for her coins, that fastened with a metal butterfly clip. It looked like it was made of leather. I wondered if it was mouse skin. She opened the purse, put her fingers into the opening, came out with a large silver coin: half a crown.
'Look!' she said. 'Look what I got!'
I wanted a half a crown. No, I wanted what I could buy with half a crown - magic tricks and plastic joke toys, and books, and, oh, so many things. But I did not want a little grey purse with a half a crown in it.
'I don't like her,' I told my sister.
'That's only because I saw her first,' said my sister. 'She's my friend.'
I did not think that Ursula Monkton was anybody's friend. I wanted to go and warn Lettie Hempstock about her - but what could I say? That the new housekeeper-nanny wore grey and pink? That she looked at me oddly?
I wished I had never let go of Lettie's hand. Ursula Monkton was my fault, I was certain of it, and I would not be able to get rid of her by flushing her down a plughole, or putting frogs in her bed.
I should have left at that moment, should have run away, fled down the lane the mile or so to the Hempstocks' farm, but I didn't, and then a taxi took my mother away to Dicksons Opticians, where she would show people letters through lenses, and dispense things to help them see more clearly, and I was left there with Ursula Monkton.
She came out into the garden with a plate of sandwiches.
'I've spoken to your mother,' she said, a sweet smile beneath the pale lipstick, 'and while I'm here, you children need to limit your travels. You can be anywhere in the house or in the garden, or I will walk with you to your friends', but you may not leave the property and simply go wandering.'
'Of course,' said my sister.
I did not say anything.
My sister ate a peanut butter sandwich.
I was starving. I wondered whether the sandwiches were dangerous or not. I did not know. I was scared that I would eat one and it would turn into worms in my stomach, and that they would wriggle through me, colonising my body, until they forced their way out of my skin.
I went back into the house. I pushed the kitchen door open. Ursula Monkton was not there. I filled my pockets with fruit, with apples and oranges and hard brown pears. I took three bananas and stuffed them down my jumper, and fled to my laboratory.
My laboratory - that was what I called it - was a green-painted shed as far away from the house as you could get, built up against the side of the house's huge old garage. A fig tree grew beside the shed, although we had never tasted ripe fruit from the tree, only seen the huge leaves and the green fruits. I called it my laboratory because I kept my chemistry set in there: the chemistry set, a perennial birthday present, had been banished from the house by my father, after I had made something in a test tube. I had randomly mixed things together, and then heated them, until they had erupted and turned black, with an ammoniac stench that refused to fade. My father had said that he did not mind me doing experiments (although neither of us knew what I could possibly have been experimenting on. That did not matter; my mother had been given chemistry sets for her birthday, and see how well that had turned out), but he did not want them within smelling range of the house.
I ate a banana and a pear, then hid the rest of the fruit beneath the wooden table.
Adults follow paths. Children explore. Adults are content to walk the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurs to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath rhododendrons, to find the spaces between fences. I was a child, and I knew a dozen different ways of getting out of our property and into the lane, ways that would not involve walking down our drive. I decided that I would creep out of the laboratory shed, along the wall to the edge of the lawn and then into the border of azaleas and bay laurels that bordered the garden there. From the laurels, I would slip down the hill and over the rusting metal fence that bordered the lane.
Nobody was looking. I ran and I crept and got through the laurels, and I went down the hill, pushing through the brambles and the nettle patches that had sprung up since the last time I went that way.
Ursula Monkton was waiting for me at the bottom of the hill, just in front of the rusting metal fence. There was no way she could have got there without me seeing her, but she was there. She folded her arms and looked at me, and her grey and pink dress flapped in a gust of wind.
'I believe I said that you were not to leave the property.'
'I'm not,' I told her, with a cockiness I knew I did not feel, not even a little. 'I'm still on the property. I'm just exploring.'
'You're sneaking around,' she said.
I said nothing.
'I think you should be in your bedroom, where I can keep an eye on you. It's time for your nap.'
I was too old for naps, but I knew that I was too young to argue, or to win the argument if I did.
'Okay,' I said.
'Don't say ""okay"",' she said. 'Say ""Yes, Miss Monkton"". Or ""ma'am"". Say ""Yes, ma'am"".' She looked down at me with her blue-grey eyes, which put me in mind of holes rotted in canvas, and which did not look pretty at that moment.
I said, 'Yes, ma'am,' and hated myself for saying it.
We walked together up the hill.
'Your parents can no longer afford this place,' said Ursula Monkton. 'And they can't afford to keep it up. Soon enough they'll see that the way to solve their financial problems is to sell this house and its gardens to property developers. Then all of this -' and this was the tangle of brambles, the unkempt world behind the lawn - 'will become a dozen identical houses and gardens. And if you are lucky, you'll get to live in one. And if not, you will just envy the people who do. Will you like that?'
I loved the house, and the garden. I loved the rambling shabbiness of it. I loved that place as if it was a part of me, and perhaps, in some ways, it was.
'Who are you?' I asked.
'Ursula Monkton. I'm your housekeeper.'
I said, 'Who are you really? Why are you giving people money?'
'Everybody wants money,' she said, as if it were self-evident. 'It makes them happy. It will make you happy, if you let it.' We had come out by the heap of grass clippings, behind the circle of green grass that we called the fairy ring: sometimes, when the weather was wet, it filled with vivid yellow toadstools.
'Now,' she said. 'Go to your room.'
I ran from her - ran as fast as I could, across the fairy ring, up the lawn, past the rose bushes, past the coal shed and into the house.
Ursula Monkton was standing just inside the back door of the house to welcome me in, although she could not have got past me. I would have seen. Her hair was perfect, and her lipstick seemed freshly applied.
'I've been inside you,' she said. 'So a word to the wise. If you tell anybody anything, they won't believe you. And because I've been inside you, I'll know. And I can make it so you never say anything I don't want you to say to anybody, not ever again.'
I went upstairs to the bedroom, and I lay on my bed. The place on the sole of my foot where the worm had been throbbed and ached, and now my chest hurt too. I went away in my head, into a book. That was where I went whenever real life was too hard or too inflexible. I pulled down a handful of my mother's old books, from when she was a girl, and I read about schoolgirls having adventures in the 1930s and 1940s. Mostly they were up against smugglers or spies or fifth columnists, whatever they were, and the girls were always brave and they always knew exactly what to do. I was not brave and I had no idea what to do.
I had never felt so alone.
I wondered if the Hempstocks were on the telephone. It seemed unlikely, but not impossible - perhaps it had been Mrs Hempstock who had reported the abandoned Mini to the police in the first place. The phone book was downstairs, but I knew the number to call Directory Enquiries, and I only had to ask for anybody named Hempstock living at Hempstock Farm. There was a phone in my parents' bedroom.
I got off the bed, went to the doorway, looked out. The upstairs hallway was empty. As quickly, as quietly as I could, I walked into the bedroom next to mine. The walls were pale pink, my parents' bed covered with a bedspread covered in its turn with huge printed roses. There were French windows to the balcony that ran along that side of the house. There was a cream-coloured telephone on the cream-and-gilt nightstand beside the bed. I picked it up, heard the dull whirring noise of the dial tone, and dialled Directory Enquiries, my finger pulling the holes in the dial down, a one, a nine, a two. I waited for the operator to come on the line, and tell me the number of the Hempstocks' farm. I had a pencil with me, and I was ready to write the telephone number down in the back of a blue cloth-bound book called Pansy Saves the School.
The operator did not come on. The dialling tone continued, and over it, Ursula Monkton's voice saying, 'Properly brought-up young people would not even think about sneaking off to use the telephone, would they?'
I did not say anything, although I have no doubt she could hear me breathing. I put the handset down on the cradle, and went back into the bedroom I shared with my sister.
I sat on my bed, and stared out of the window.
My bed was pushed up hard against the wall just below the window. I loved to sleep with the window open. Rainy nights were the best of all: I would open the window and put my head on my pillow and close my eyes and feel the wind on my face and listen to the trees sway and creak. There would be raindrops blown on to my face, too, if I was lucky, and I would imagine that I was in my boat on the ocean and that it was swaying with the swell of the sea. I did not imagine that I was a pirate, or that I was going anywhere. I was just on my boat.
But now it was not raining, and it was not night. All I could see through the window were trees, and clouds, and the distant purple of the horizon.
I had emergency chocolate supplies hidden beneath the large plastic Batman figurine I had acquired on my birthday, and I ate them, and as I ate them I thought of letting go of Lettie Hempstock's hand to grab the ball of rotting cloth, remembered the stabbing pain in my foot that had followed.
I brought her here, I thought, and I knew that it was true.
Ursula Monkton wasn't real. She was a cardboard mask for the thing that had travelled inside me as a worm, that had flapped and gusted in the open country under that orange sky.
I went back to reading Pansy Saves the School. The secret plans to the airbase next door to the school were being smuggled out to the enemy by spies who were teachers working on the school vegetable allotment: the plans were concealed inside hollowed-out vegetable marrows.
'Great heavens!' said Inspector Davidson of Scotland Yard's renowned Smugglers and Secret Spies Division (the SSSD). 'That is literally the last place we would have looked!'
'We owe you an apology, Pansy,' said the stern headmistress, with an uncharacteristically warm smile, and a twinkle in her eyes that made Pansy think perhaps she had misjudged the woman all this term. 'You have saved the reputation of the school! Now, before you get too full of yourself - aren't there some French verbs you ought to be conjugating for Madame?'
I could be happy with Pansy, in some part of my head, even while the rest of my head was filled with fear. I waited for my parents to come home. I would tell them what was happening. I would tell them. They would believe me.
At that time my father worked in an office an hour's drive away. I was not certain what he did. He had a very nice, pretty secretary, with a toy poodle, and whenever she knew we children would be coming in to see him, she would bring the poodle in from home, and we would play with it. Sometimes we would pass buildings and my father would say, 'That's one of ours.' But I did not care about buildings, so I never asked how it was one of ours, or even who we were.
I lay on my bed, reading book after book, until Ursula Monkton appeared in the doorway of the room and said, 'You can come down now.'
My sister was watching television downstairs, in the television room. She was watching a programme called HOW, a pop science-and-how-things-work show, which opened with the hosts in Native American headdresses saying 'How?' and doing embarrassing war whoops.
I wanted to turn over to the BBC, but my sister looked at me triumphantly and said, 'Ursula says it can stay on whatever I want to watch and you aren't allowed to change it.'
I sat with her for a minute, as an old man with a moustache showed all the children of England how to tie fishing flies.
I said, 'She's not nice.'
'I like her. She's pretty.'
My mother arrived home five minutes later, called hello from the corridor then went into the kitchen to see Ursula Monkton. She reappeared. 'Dinner will be ready as soon as Daddy gets home. Wash your hands.'
My sister went upstairs and washed her hands.
I said to my mother, 'I don't like her. Will you make her go away?'
My mother sighed. 'It is not going to be Gertruda all over again, dear. Ursula's a very nice girl, from a very good family. And she positively adores the two of you.'
My father came home, and dinner was served. A thick vegetable soup, then roast chicken and new potatoes with frozen peas. I loved all of the things on the table. I did not eat any of it.
'I'm not hungry,' I explained.
'I'm not one for telling tales out of school,' said Ursula Monkton, 'but someone had chocolate on his hands and face when he came down from his bedroom.'
'I wish you wouldn't eat that rubbish,' grumbled my father.
'It's just processed sugar. And it ruins your appetite and your teeth,' said my mother.
I was scared they would force me to eat, but they didn't. I sat there hungrily, while Ursula Monkton laughed at all my father's jokes. It seemed to me that he was making special jokes, just for her.
After dinner we all watched Mission: Impossible. I usually liked Mission: Impossible, but this time it made me feel uneasy, as people kept pulling their faces off to reveal new faces beneath. They were wearing rubber masks, and it was always our heroes underneath, but I wondered what would happen if Ursula Monkton pulled off her face, what would be underneath that?
We went to bed. It was my sister's night, and the bedroom door was closed. I missed the light in the hall. I lay in bed with the window open, wide awake, listening to the noises an old house makes at the end of a long day, and I wished as hard as I could, hoping my wishes could become real. I wished that my parents would send Ursula Monkton away, and then I would go down to the Hempstocks' farm, and tell Lettie what I had done, and she would forgive me, and make everything all right.
I could not sleep. My sister was already asleep. She seemed able to go to sleep whenever she wanted to, a skill I envied and did not have.
I left my bedroom.
I loitered at the top of the stairs, listening to the noise of the television coming from downstairs. Then I crept barefoot-silent down the stairs and sat on the third step from the bottom. The door to the television room was half open, and if I went down another step, whoever was watching the television would be able to see me. So I waited there.
I could hear the television voices punctuated by staccato bursts of TV laughter.
And then, over the television voices, adults talking.
Ursula Monkton said, 'So, is your wife away every evening?'
My father's voice. 'No. She's gone this evening to organise tomorrow. But from tomorrow it will be weekly. She's raising money for Africa, in the village hall. For drilling wells, and I believe for contraception.'
'Well,' said Ursula, 'I already know all about that.'
She laughed, a high, tinkling laugh, which sounded friendly and true and real, and had no flapping rags in it. Then she said, 'Little pitchers ...' and a moment later the door opened the whole way, and Ursula Monkton was looking straight at me. She had redone her make-up, her pale lipstick and her big eyelashes.
'Go to bed,' she said. 'Now.'
'I want to talk to my dad,' I said, without hope. She said nothing, just smiled, with no warmth in it, and no love, and I went back up the stairs, and climbed into my bed, and lay in the darkened bedroom until I gave up on sleeping, and then sleep enveloped me when I was not expecting it, and I slept without comfort.
OCEAN_ch7	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	7	2883	14880	The next day was bad.
My parents had both left the house before I woke.
It had turned cold, and the sky was a bleak and charmless grey. I went through my parents' bedroom to the balcony that ran along the length of their bedroom and my sister's and mine, and I stood on the long balcony and I prayed to the sky that Ursula Monkton would have tired of this game, and that I would not see her again.
Ursula Monkton was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs when I went down.
'Same rules as yesterday, little pitcher,' she said. 'You can't leave the property. If you try, I will lock you in your bedroom for the rest of the day, and when your parents come home I will tell them you did something disgusting.'
'They won't believe you.'
She smiled sweetly. 'Are you sure? If I tell them you pulled out your little willy and widdled all over the kitchen floor, and I had to mop it up and disinfect it? I think they'll believe me. I'll be very convincing.'
I went out of the house and down to my laboratory. I ate all the fruit that I had hidden there the day before. I read Sandie Sees it Through, another of my mother's books. Sandie was a plucky but poor schoolgirl who was accidentally sent to a posh school, where everybody hated her. In the end she exposed the geography teacher as an International Bolshevik, who had tied the real geography teacher up. The climax was in the school assembly, when Sandie bravely got up and made a speech which began, 'I know I should not have been sent here. It was only an error in paperwork that sent me here and sent Sandy spelled with a Y to the town grammar school. But I thank Providence that I came here. Because Miss Streebling is not whom she claims to be.'
In the end Sandie was embraced by the people who had hated her.
My father came home early from work - earlier than I remembered seeing him home in years.
I wanted to talk to him, but he was never alone.
I watched them from the branch of my beech tree.
First he showed Ursula Monkton around the gardens, proudly pointing out the rose bushes and the blackcurrant bushes and the cherry trees and the azaleas as if he had had something to do with them, as if they had not been put in place and tended by Mr Wollery for fifty years before we had bought the house.
She laughed at all his jokes. I could not hear what he was saying, but I could see the crooked smile he had when he knew he was saying something funny.
She was standing too close to him. Sometimes he would rest his hand on her shoulder, in a friendly sort of way. It worried me that he was standing so close to her. He didn't know what she was. She was a monster, and he just thought she was a normal person, and he was being nice to her. She was wearing different clothes today: a grey skirt, of the kind they called a midi, and a pink blouse.
On any other day, if I had seen my father walking around the garden I would have run over to him. But not that day. I was scared that he would be angry, or that Ursula Monkton would say something to make him angry with me.
I was terrified of him when he was angry. His face (angular and usually affable) would grow red, and he would shout, shout so loudly and furiously that it would, literally, paralyse me. I would not be able to think.
He never hit me. He did not believe in hitting. He would tell us how his father had hit him, how his mother had chased him with a broom, how he was better than that. When he got angry enough to shout at me, he would occasionally remind me that he did not hit me, as if to make me grateful. In the school stories I read, misbehaviour often resulted in a caning, or the slipper, and then was forgiven and done, and I would sometimes envy those fictional children the cleanness of their lives.
I did not want to approach Ursula Monkton: I did not want to risk making my father angry with me.
I wondered if this would be a good time to try and leave the property, to head down the lane, but I was certain that if I did, I would look up to see my father's angry face beside Ursula Monkton's, all pretty and smug.
So I simply watched them from the huge branch of the beech tree. When they walked out of sight, behind the azalea bushes, I clambered down the rope ladder, went up into the house, up to the balcony, and I watched them from there. It was a grey day, but there were butter-yellow daffodils everywhere, and narcissi in profusion, with their pale outer petals and their dark orange trumpets. My father picked a handful of narcissi and gave them to Ursula Monkton, who laughed, and said something, then made a curtsey. He bowed in return, and said something that made her laugh. I thought he must have proclaimed himself her Knight in Shining Armour, or something like that.
I wanted to shout down to him, to warn him that he was giving flowers to a monster, but I did not. I just stood on the balcony and watched, and they did not look up and they did not see me.
My book of Greek myths had told me that the narcissi were named after a beautiful young man, so lovely that he had fallen in love with himself. He saw his reflection in a pool of water, and would not leave it, and eventually died, so that the gods were forced to transform him into a flower. In my mind, when I read this, I knew that a narcissus must be the most beautiful flower in the world. I was disappointed when I learned that it was just a less impressive daffodil.
My sister came out of the house and went over to them. My father picked her up. They all walked inside together, my father with my sister holding on to his neck, and Ursula Monkton, her arms filled with yellow and white flowers. I watched them. I watched as my father's free hand, the one not holding my sister, went down and rested, casually, proprietorially, on the swell of Ursula Monkton's midi-skirted bottom.
I would react differently to that now. At the time, I do not believe I thought anything of it at all. I was seven.
I climbed up into my bedroom window, easy to reach from the balcony, and down on to my bed, where I read a book about a girl who stayed in the Channel Islands and defied the Nazis because she would not abandon her pony.
And while I read, I thought, Ursula Monkton cannot keep me here for ever. Soon enough - in a few days at the most - someone will take me into town, or away from here, and then I will go to the farm at the bottom of the lane, and I will tell Lettie Hempstock what I did.
Then I thought, suppose Ursula Monkton only needs a couple of days. And that scared me.
Ursula Monkton made meatloaf for dinner that evening, and I would not eat it. I was determined not to eat anything she had made or cooked or touched. My father was not amused.
'But I don't want it,' I told him. 'I'm not hungry.'
It was Wednesday, and my mother was attending her meeting, to raise money so that people in Africa who needed water could drill wells. The meeting was in the village hall of the next village down the road. She had posters that she put up, diagrams of wells, and photographs of smiling people. At the dinner table were my sister, my father, Ursula Monkton, and me.
'It's good, it's good for you, and it's tasty,' said my father. 'And we do not waste food in this house.'
'I said I wasn't hungry.'
I had lied. I was so hungry it hurt.
'Then just try a little nibble,' he said. 'It's your favourite. Meatloaf and mashed potatoes and gravy. You love them.'
There was a children's table in the kitchen, where we ate when my parents had friends over, or would be eating late. But that night we were at the adult table. I preferred the children's table. I felt invisible there. Nobody watched me eat.
Ursula Monkton sat next to my father and stared at me, with a tiny smile at the corner of her lips.
I knew I should shut up, be silent, be sullen. But I couldn't help myself. I had to tell my father why I did not want to eat.
'I won't eat anything she made,' I told him. 'I don't like her.'
'You will eat your food,' said my father. 'You will at least try it. And apologise to Miss Monkton.'
'I won't.'
'He doesn't have to,' said Ursula Monkton sympathetically, and she looked at me, and she smiled. I do not think that either of the other two people at the table noticed that she was smiling, or that there was nothing sympathetic in her expression, or her smile, or her rotting-cloth eyes.
'I'm afraid he does,' said my father. His voice was just a little louder, and his face was just a little redder. 'I won't have him cheeking you like that.' Then, to me, 'Give me one good reason, just one, why you won't apologise, and why you won't eat the lovely food that Ursula has prepared for us.'
I did not lie well. I told him.
'Because she's not human,' I said. 'She's a monster. She's a ...' What had the Hempstocks called her kind of thing? 'She's a flea.'
My father's cheeks were burning red now, and his lips were thin. He said, 'Outside. Into the hall. This minute.'
My heart sank inside me. I climbed down from my stool and followed him out into the corridor. It was dark in the hallway: the only light came from the kitchen, a sheet of clear glass above the door. He looked down at me. 'You will go back into the kitchen. You will apologise to Miss Monkton. You will finish your plate of food, then, quietly and politely, you will go straight upstairs to bed.'
'No,' I told him. 'I won't.'
I bolted, ran down the hallway, round the corner, and I pounded up the stairs. My father, I had no doubt, would come after me. He was twice my size, and fast, but I did not have to keep going for long. There was only one room in that house that I could lock, and it was there that I was headed, left at the top of the stairs and along the hall to the end. I reached the bathroom ahead of my father. I slammed the door, and I pushed the little silver bolt closed.
He had not chased me. Perhaps he thought it was beneath his dignity, chasing a child. But in a few moments I heard his fist slam, and then his voice saying, 'Open this door.'
I didn't say anything. I sat on the plush toilet seat cover and I hated him almost as much as I hated Ursula Monkton.
The door banged again, harder this time. 'If you don't open this door,' he said, loud enough to make sure I heard it through the wood, 'I'm breaking it down.'
Could he do that? I didn't know. The door was locked. Locked doors stopped people coming in. A locked door meant that you were in there, and when people wanted to come into the bathroom they would jiggle the door, and it wouldn't open, and they would say, 'Sorry!' or shout, 'Are you going to be long?' and-
The door exploded inward. The little silver bolt hung off the frame, all bent and broken, and my father stood in the doorway, filling it, his eyes huge and white, his cheeks burning with fury.
He said, 'Right.'
That was all he said, but his hand held my left upper arm in a grip I could never have broken. I wondered what he would do now. Would he, finally, hit me, or send me to my room, or shout at me so loudly that I would wish I were dead?
He did none of those things.
He pulled me over to the bathtub. He leaned over, pushed the white rubber plug into the plughole. Then he turned on the cold tap. Water gushed out, splashing the white enamel, then, steadily and slowly, it filled the bath.
The water ran noisily.
My father turned to the open door. 'I can deal with this,' he said to Ursula Monkton.
She stood in the doorway, holding my sister's hand, and she looked concerned and gentle, but there was triumph in her eyes.
'Close the door,' said my father. My sister started whimpering, but Ursula Monkton closed the door, as best she could, for one of the hinges did not fit properly, and the broken bolt stopped the door shutting all the way.
It was just me and my father. His cheeks had gone from red to white, and his lips were pressed together, and I did not know what he was going to do, or why he was running a bath, but I was scared, so scared.
'I'll apologise,' I told him. 'I'll say sorry. I didn't mean what I said. She's not a monster. She's ... she's pretty.'
He didn't say anything in response. The bath was full, and he turned the cold tap off.
Then, swiftly, he picked me up. He put his huge hands under my armpits, swung me up with ease, so I felt like I weighed nothing at all.
I looked at him, at the intent expression on his face. He had taken off his jacket before he came upstairs. He was wearing a light blue shirt and a maroon paisley tie. He pulled off his watch on its expandable strap, dropped it on to the window ledge.
Then I realised what he was going to do, and I kicked out, and I flailed at him, neither of which action had any effect of any kind as he plunged me down into the cold water.
I was horrified, but it was initially the horror of something happening against the established order of things. I was fully dressed. That was wrong. I had my sandals on. That was wrong. The bath water was cold, so cold and so wrong. That was what I thought, initially, as he pushed me into the water, and then he pushed further, pushing my head and shoulders beneath the chilly water, and the horror changed its nature. I thought, I'm going to die.
And, thinking that, I was determined to live.
I flailed with my hands, trying to find something to hold on to, but there was nothing to grab, only the slippery sides of the bath I'd bathed in for the last two years. (I had read many books in that bath. It was one of my safe places. And now, I had no doubt, I was going to die there.)
I opened my eyes, beneath the water, and I saw it dangling there, in front of my face: my chance for life, and I clutched it with both hands: my father's tie.
I held it tightly, pulled myself up as he pushed me down, gripping it for life itself, pulling my face up and out of that frigid water, holding on to his tie so tightly that he could no longer push my head and shoulders back into the bath without going in himself.
My face was now out of the water, and I clamped my teeth into his tie, just below the knot.
We struggled. I was soaked, took some small pleasure in the knowledge that he was soaked as well, his blue shirt clinging to his huge form.
Now he pushed me down again, but fear of death gives us strength: my hands and my teeth were clamped to his tie, and he could not break my grip on them without hitting me.
My father did not hit me.
He straightened up, and I was pulled up with him, soaked and spluttering and angry and crying and scared. I let go of his tie with my teeth, still held on with my hands.
He said, 'You ruined my tie. Let go.' The tie knot had tightened to pea size; the lining of the tie was dangling damply outside of it. He said, 'You should be glad that your mother isn't here.'
I let go, dropped to the soaked bathroom carpet. I took a step backward, towards the toilet. He looked down at me. Then he said, 'Go to your bedroom. I don't want to see you again tonight.'
I went to my room.
OCEAN_ch8	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	8	5625	29095	I was shivering convulsively and I was wet through and I was cold, very cold. It felt like all my heat had been stolen. The wet clothes clung to my flesh and dripped cold water on to the floor. With every step I took, my sandals made comical squelching noises, and water oozed from the little diamond-shaped holes on the top of them.
I pulled all of my clothes off, and I left them in a sopping heap on the tiles by the fireplace, where they began to puddle. I took the box of matches from the mantelpiece, turned on the gas tap and lit the flame in the gas fire.
(I am staring at a pond, remembering things that are hard to believe. Why do I find the hardest thing for me to believe, looking back, is that a girl of five and a boy of seven had a gas fire in their bedroom?)
There were no towels in the room, and I stood there, wet, wondering how to dry myself off. I took the thin counterpane that covered my bed, wiped myself off with it, then put on my pyjamas. They were red nylon, shiny and striped, with a black plasticised burn mark on the left sleeve, where I had leaned too close to the gas fire once, and the pyjama arm caught alight, although by some miracle I had not burned my arm.
There was a dressing gown that I almost never used hanging on the back of the bedroom door, its shadow perfectly positioned to cast nightmare shadows on the wall when the hall light was on and the door was open. I put it on.
The bedroom door opened, and my sister came in to get the nightdress from under her pillow. She said, 'You've been so naughty that I'm not even allowed to be in the room with you. I get to sleep in Mummy and Daddy's bed tonight. And Daddy says I can watch the television.'
There was an old television in a brown wooden cabinet in the corner of my parents' bedroom that was almost never turned on. The vertical hold was unreliable, and the fuzzy black and white picture had a tendency to stream, in a slow ribbon: people's heads vanished off the bottom of the screen as their feet descended, in a stately fashion, from the top.
'I don't care,' I told her.
'Daddy said you ruined his tie. And he's all wet,' said my sister, with satisfaction in her voice.
Ursula Monkton was at the bedroom door. 'We don't talk to him,' she told my sister. 'We won't talk to him again until he's allowed to rejoin the family.'
My sister slipped out, heading to the next room, my parents' room. 'You aren't in my family,' I told Ursula Monkton. 'When Mummy comes back, I'll tell her what Daddy did.'
'She won't be home for another two hours,' said Ursula Monkton. 'And what can you say to her that will make any difference? She backs up your father in everything, doesn't she?'
She did. They always presented a perfectly united front.
'Don't cross me,' said Ursula Monkton. 'I have things to do here, and you are getting in my way. Next time it will be so much worse. Next time, I lock you in the attic.'
'I'm not afraid of you,' I told her. I was afraid of her, more afraid than I had ever been of anything.
'It's hot in here,' she told me, and smiled. She walked over to the gas fire, reached down, turned it off, took the matches from the mantel.
I said, 'You're still just a flea.'
She stopped smiling. She reached up to the lintel above the door, higher than any child could reach, and she pulled down the key that rested there. She walked out of the room, and closed the door. I heard the key turn, heard the lock engage and click.
I could hear television voices coming from the room next door. I heard the hallway door close, cutting off the two bedrooms from the rest of the house, and I knew that Ursula Monkton was going downstairs. I went over to the lock, and squinted through it. I had learned from a book that I could use a pencil to push a key through a keyhole on to a sheet of paper beneath, and free myself that way ... but the keyhole was empty.
I cried then, cold and still damp, in that bedroom, cried with pain and anger and terror, cried safely in the knowledge that no one would come in and see me, that no one would tease me for crying, as they teased any boys at my school who were unwise enough to give way to tears.
I heard the gentle patter of raindrops against the glass of my bedroom window, and even that brought me no joy.
I cried until I was all cried out. Then I breathed in huge gulps of air, and I thought, Ursula Monkton, flapping canvas monster, worm and flea, would get me if I tried to leave the property. I knew that.
But Ursula Monkton had locked me in. She would not expect me to leave now.
And perhaps, if I was lucky, she might be distracted.
I opened the bedroom window, and listened to the night. The gentle rain made a noise that was almost a rustling. It was a cold night, and I was already chilled. My sister was in the room next door, watching something on the television. She would not hear me.
I went over to the door, and turned off the light.
I walked through the dark bedroom, and climbed back on the bed.
I'm in my bed, I thought. I'm lying in my bed, thinking about how upset I am. Soon, I'll fall asleep. I'm in my bed, and I know she's won, and if she checks up on me I'm in my bed, asleep.
I'm in my bed, and it's time for me to sleep now ...  I can't even keep my eyes open. I'm fast asleep. Fast asleep in my bed ...
I stood on the bed, and climbed out of the window. I hung for a moment, then let myself drop, as quietly as I could, on to the balcony. That was the easy bit.
Growing up, I took so many cues from books. They taught me most of what I knew about what people did, about how to behave. They were my teachers and my advisers. In books, boys climbed trees, so I climbed trees, sometimes very high, always scared of falling. In books, people climbed up and down drainpipes to get in and out of houses, so I climbed up and down drainpipes too. They were the heavy iron drainpipes of old, clamped to the brick, not today's lightweight plastic affairs.
I had never climbed down a drainpipe in the dark, or in the rain, but I knew where the footholds were. I knew also that the biggest challenge would not be falling, a twenty-foot tumble down into the wet flower bed; it was that the drainpipe I was climbing down went past the television room, downstairs, in which, I had no doubt, Ursula Monkton and my father would be watching television.
I tried not to think.
I climbed over the brick wall that edged the balcony, reached out until I felt the iron drainpipe, cold and slick with rain. I held on to it, then took one large step towards it, letting my bare feet come to rest on the metal clamp that encircled the drainpipe, fixing it sturdily to the brick.
I went down, a step at a time, imagining myself Batman, imagining myself a hundred heroes and heroines of school romances, then, remembering myself, I imagined that I was a drop of rain on the wall, a brick, a tree. I am on my bed, I thought. I was not here, with the light of the TV room, uncurtained, spilling out below me, making the rain that fell past the window into a series of glittering lines and streaks.
Don't look at me, I thought. Don't look out of the window.
I inched down. Usually I would have stepped from the drainpipe over to the TV room's outer window ledge, but that was out of the question. Warily, I lowered myself another few inches, leaned further back into the shadows and away from the light, and stole a terrified glance into the room, expecting to see my father and Ursula Monkton staring back at me.
The room was empty.
The lights were on, the television was on as well, but nobody was sitting on the sofa and the door to the downstairs hallway was open.
I took an easy step down on to the window ledge, hoping against all hope that neither of them would come back in and see me, then I let myself drop from the ledge into the flower bed. The wet earth was soft against my feet.
I was going to run, just run, but there was a light on in the drawing room, where we children never went, the oak-panelled room kept only for best and for special occasions.
The curtains were drawn. They were green velvet, lined with white, and the light that escaped them, where they had not been closed all the way, was golden and soft.
I walked over to the window. The curtains were not completely closed. I could see into the room, see what was immediately in front of me.
I was not sure what I was looking at. My father had Ursula Monkton pressed up against the side of the big fireplace in the far wall. He had his back to me. She did too, her hands pressed against the huge high mantelpiece. He was hugging her from behind. Her midi skirt was hiked up around her waist.
I did not know exactly what they were doing, and I did not really care, not at that moment. All that mattered was that Ursula Monkton had her attention on something that was not me, and I turned away from the gap in the curtains and the light and the house, and fled, barefoot, into the rainy dark.
It was not pitch-black. It was the kind of cloudy night where the clouds seem to gather up light from distant street lights and houses below, and throw it back at the earth. I could see enough, once my eyes adjusted. I made it to the bottom of the garden, past the compost heap and the grass cuttings, then down the hill to the lane. Brambles and thorns stuck my feet and pricked my legs, but I kept running.
I went over the low metal fence, into the lane. I was off our property and it felt as if a headache I had not known that I had had suddenly lifted. I whispered, urgently, 'Lettie? Lettie Hempstock?' and I thought, I'm in bed. I'm dreaming all this. Such vivid dreams. I am in my bed, but I did not believe that Ursula Monkton was thinking about me just then.
As I ran, I thought of my father, his arms around the housekeeper-who-wasn't, kissing her neck, and then I saw his face through the chilly bathwater as he held me under, and now I was no longer scared by what had happened in the bathroom; now I was scared by what it meant that my father was kissing the neck of Ursula Monkton, that his hands had lifted her midi skirt above her waist.
My parents were a unit, inviolate. The future had suddenly become unknowable: anything could happen; the train of my life had jumped the rails and headed off across the fields and was coming down the lane with me, then.
The flints of the lane hurt my feet as I ran, but I did not care. Soon enough, I was certain, the thing that was Ursula Monkton would be done with my father. Perhaps they would go upstairs to check on me together. She would find that I was gone and she would come after me.
I thought, if they come after me, they will be in a car. I looked for a gap in the hedgerow on either side of the lane. I spotted a wooden stile and clambered over it, and kept running across the meadow, heart pounding like the biggest, loudest drum there was or had ever been, barefoot, with my pyjamas and my dressing gown all soaked below the knee and clinging. I ran, not caring about the cow pats. The meadow was easier on my feet than the flint lane had been. I was happier, and I felt more real, running on the grass.
Thunder rumbled behind me, although I had seen no lightning. I climbed a fence, and my feet sank into the soft earth of a freshly ploughed field. I stumbled across it, falling sometimes, but I kept going. Over a stile and into the next field, this one unploughed, and I crossed it keeping close to the hedge, scared of being too far out in the open.
The lights of a car came down the lane, sudden and blinding. I froze where I was, closed my eyes, imagined myself asleep in my bed. The car drove past without slowing, and I caught a glimpse of its red rear lights as it moved away from me: a white van that I thought belonged to the Anders family.
Still, it made the lane seem less safe, and now I cut away across the meadow. I reached the next field, saw it was only divided from the one I was in by thin lengths of wire, easy to duck beneath, not even barbed wire, so I reached out my arm and pushed a bare wire up to make room to squeeze under, and-
It was as if I had been thumped, and thumped hard, in the chest. My arm, where it had grasped the wire of the fence, was convulsed, and my palm was burning just as if I had just slammed my funny bone into a wall.
I let go of the electric fence and stumbled back. I could not run any longer, but I hurried in the wind and the rain and the darkness along the side of the fence, careful now not to touch it, until I reached a five-bar gate. I went over the gate, and across the field, heading to the deeper darkness at the far end - trees, I thought, and woodland - and I did not go too close to the edge of the field in case there was another electric fence waiting for me.
I hesitated, uncertain where to go next. As if in answer, the world was illuminated, for a moment, but I only needed a moment, by lightning. I saw a wooden stile, and I ran for it.
Over the stile. I came down into a clump of nettles, I knew, as the hot-cold pricking burning covered my exposed ankles and the tops of my feet, but I ran again, now, ran as best I could. I hoped I was still heading for the Hempstocks' farm. I had to be. I crossed one more field before I realised that I no longer knew where the lane was, or, for that matter, where I was. I knew only that the Hempstocks' farm was at the end of my lane, but I was lost in a dark field, and the thunderclouds had lowered, and the night was so dark, and it was still raining, even if it was not raining hard yet, and now my imagination filled the darkness with wolves and ghosts. I wanted to stop imagining, to stop thinking, but I could not.
And behind the wolves and the ghosts and the trees that walked, there was Ursula Monkton, telling me that the next time I disobeyed her it would be so much worse for me, that she would lock me in the attic.
I was not brave. I was running away from everything, and I was cold, and wet and lost.
I shouted, at the top of my voice. 'Lettie? Lettie Hempstock! Hello?' but there was no reply, and I had not expected one.
The thunder grumbled and rumbled into a low continuous roar, a lion pushed into irritability, and the lightning was flashing and flickering like a malfunctioning fluorescent tube. In the flickers of light, I could see that the area of field I was in came to a point, with hedges on both sides, and no way through. I could see no gate, and no stile other than the one I had come in through, at the far end of the field.
Something crackled.
I looked up at the sky. I had seen lightning in films on the television, long jagged forks of light across the clouds. But the lightning I had seen until now with my own eyes was simply a white flash from above, like the flash of a camera, burning the world in a strobe of visibility. What I saw in the sky then was not that.
It was not forked lightning either.
It came and it went, a writhing, burning blue-whiteness in the sky. It died back and then it flared up, and its flares and flickers illuminated the meadow, made it something I could see. The rain pattered hard, and then it whipped against my face, moved in a moment from a drizzle to a downpour, and in seconds my dressing gown was soaked through. But in the light I saw - or thought I saw - an opening in the hedgerow to my right, and I walked, for I could no longer run, not any longer, as fast as I could, towards it, hoping it was something real. My wet gown flapped in the gusting wind, and the sound of it horrified me.
I did not look up in the sky. I did not look behind me.
But I could see the far end of the field, and there was indeed a space between the hedgerows. I had almost reached it when a voice said:
'I thought I told you to stay in your room. And now I find you sneaking around like a drowned sailor.'
I turned, looked behind me, saw nothing at all. There was nobody there.
Then I looked up.
The thing that called itself Ursula Monkton hung in the air, about twenty feet above me, and lightnings crawled and flickered in the air behind her. She was not flying. She was floating, weightless as a balloon, although the sharp gusts of wind did not move her.
Wind howled and whipped at my face. The distant thunder roared and smaller thunders crackled and spat, and she spoke quietly, but I could hear every word she said as distinctly as if she were whispering into my ears.
'Oh, sweety-weety-pudding-and-pie, you are in so much trouble.'
She was smiling, the hugest, toothiest grin I had ever seen on a human face, but she did not look amused.
I had been running from her through the darkness for, what, half an hour? An hour? I wished I had stayed on the lane and not tried to cut across the fields. I would have been at the Hempstocks' farm by now. Instead, I was lost and I was trapped.
Ursula Monkton came lower. Her pink blouse was open and unbuttoned. She wore a white bra. Her midi skirt flapped in the wind, revealing her calves. She did not appear to be wet, despite the storm. Her clothes, her face, her hair were perfectly dry.
She was floating above me now, and she reached out her hands.
Every move she made, everything she did, was strobed by the tame lightnings that flickered and writhed about her. Her fingers opened like flowers in a speeded-up film, and I knew that she was playing with me, and I knew what she wanted me to do, and I hated myself for not standing my ground, but I did what she wanted: I ran.
I was a little thing that amused her. She was playing, just as I had seen Monster, the big orange tomcat, play with a mouse - letting it go, so that it would run, and then pouncing, and batting it down with a paw. But the mouse still ran, and I had no choice, and I ran too.
I ran for the break in the hedge, as fast as I could, stumbling and hurting and wet.
Her voice was in my ears as I ran.
'I told you I was going to lock you in the attic, didn't I? And I will. Your daddy likes me now. He'll do whatever I say. Perhaps from now on, every night, he'll come up the ladder and let you out of the attic. He'll make you climb down from the attic. Down the ladder. And every night, he'll drown you in the bath, he'll plunge you into the cold, cold water. I'll let him do it every night until it bores me, and then I'll tell him not to bring you back, to simply push you under the water until you stop moving and until there's nothing but darkness and water in your lungs. I'll have him leave you in the cold bath, and you'll never move again. And every night I'll kiss him and kiss him ...'
I was through the gap in the hedgerow, and running on soft grass.
The crackle of the lightning, and a strange sharp, metallic smell were so close they made my skin prickle. Everything around me got brighter and brighter, illuminated by the flickering blue-white light.
'And when your daddy finally leaves you in the bath for good, you'll be happy,' whispered Ursula Monkton, and I imagined that I could feel her lips brushing my ears. 'Because you won't like it in the attic. Not just because it's dark up there, with the spiders, and the ghosts. But because I'm going to bring my friends. You can't see them in the daylight, but they'll be in the attic with you, and you won't enjoy them at all. They don't like little boys, my friends. They'll be spiders as big as dogs. Old clothes with nothing inside that tug at you and never let you go. The inside of your head. And no books, and no stories, ever again.'
And I realised that I had not imagined it. Her lips had brushed my ear. She was floating in the air beside me, so her head was next to mine, and when she caught me looking at her she smiled her pretend smile, and I could not run any longer. I could barely move. I had a stitch in my side, and I could not catch my breath, and I was done.
My legs gave way beneath me, and I stumbled and fell, and this time I did not get up.
I felt heat on my legs, and I looked down to see a yellow stream coming from the front of my pyjama trousers. I was seven years old, no longer a little child, but I was wetting myself with fear, like a baby, and there was nothing I could do about it, while Ursula Monkton hung in the air above me and watched, dispassionately.
The hunt was done.
She stood up straight in the air, three feet above the ground. I was sprawled beneath her, on my back, in the wet grass. She began to descend, slowly, inexorably, like a person on a broken television screen.
Something touched my left hand. Something soft. It nosed my hand, and I looked over, fearing a spider as big as a dog. In the light of the lightnings that writhed about Ursula Monkton, I saw a patch of darkness beside my hand. A patch of darkness with a white spot over one ear. I picked the kitten up in my hand, and brought it to my heart, and I stroked it.
I said, 'I won't come with you. You can't make me.' I sat up, because I felt less vulnerable sitting, and the kitten curled and made itself comfortable in my hand.
'Pudding-and-pie boy,' said Ursula Monkton. Her feet touched the ground, illuminated by her own lightnings, like a painting of a woman in greys and greens and blues, not a real woman at all. 'You're just a little boy. I'm a grown-up. I was an adult when your world was a ball of molten rock. I can do whatever I wish to you. Now, stand up. I'm taking you home.'
The kitten, which was burrowing into my chest with its face, made a high-pitched noise, not a mew. I turned, looking away from Ursula Monkton, looking behind me.
The girl who was walking towards us, across the field, wore a shiny red raincoat, with a hood, and a pair of black wellington boots that seemed too big for her. She walked out of the darkness, unafraid. She looked up at Ursula Monkton.
'Get off my land,' said Lettie Hempstock.
Ursula Monkton took a step backwards and rose, at the same time, so she hung in the air above us. Lettie Hempstock reached out to me, without glancing down at where I sat, and she took my hand, twining her fingers into mine.
'I'm not touching your land,' said Ursula Monkton. 'Go away, little girl.'
'You are on my land,' said Lettie Hempstock.
Ursula Monkton smiled, and the lightnings wreathed and writhed about her. She was power incarnate, standing in the crackling air. She was the storm, she was the lightning, she was the adult world with all its power and all its secrets and all its foolish casual cruelty. She winked at me.
I was a seven-year-old boy, and my feet were scratched and bleeding. I had just wet myself. And the thing that floated above me was huge and greedy, and it wanted to take me to the attic, and when it tired of me it would make my daddy kill me.
Lettie Hempstock's hand in my hand made me braver. But Lettie was just a girl, even if she was a big girl, even if she was eleven, even if she had been eleven for a very long time. Ursula Monkton was an adult. It did not matter, at that moment, that she was every monster, every witch, every nightmare made flesh. She was also an adult, and when adults fight children, adults always win.
Lettie said, 'You should go back where you came from in the first place. It's not healthy for you to be here. For your own good, go back.'
A noise in the air, a horrible, twisted scratching noise, filled with pain and with wrongness, a noise that set my teeth on edge and made the kitten, its front paws resting on my chest, stiffen and its fur prickle. The little thing twisted and clawed up on to my shoulder, and it hissed and it spat. I looked up at Ursula Monkton. It was only when I saw her face that I knew what the noise was.
Ursula Monkton was laughing.
'Go back? When your people ripped the hole in Forever, I seized my chance. I could have ruled worlds, but I followed you, and I waited, and I had patience. I knew that sooner or later the bounds would loosen, that I would walk the true Earth, beneath the Sun of Heaven.' She was not laughing now. 'Everything here is so weak, little girl. Everything breaks so easily. They want such simple things. I will take all I want from this world, like a child stuffing its fat little face with blackberries from a bush.'
I did not let go of Lettie's hand, not this time. I stroked the kitten, whose needle claws were digging into my shoulder, and was bitten for my trouble, but the bite was not hard, just scared.
Her voice came from all around us, as the storm wind gusted. 'You kept me away from here for a long time. But then you brought me a door, and I used him to carry me out of my cell. And what can you do now that I am out?'
Lettie didn't seem angry. She thought about it, then she said, 'I could make you a new door. Or, better still, I could get Granny to send you across the ocean, all the way to wherever you came from in the beginning.'
Ursula Monkton spat on to the grass, and a tiny ball of flame sputtered and fizzed on the ground, where the spit had fallen.
'Give me the boy,' was all she said. 'He belongs to me. I came here inside him. I own him.'
'You don't own nuffink, you don't,' said Lettie Hempstock, angrily. ''Specially not him.' Lettie helped me to my feet, and she stood behind me and put her arms around me. We were two children in a field in the night. She held me, and I held the kitten, while above us and all around us a voice said:
'What will you do? Take him home with you? This world is a world of rules, little girl. He belongs to his parents, after all. Take him away and his parents will come to bring him home, and his parents belong to me.'
'I'm all bored of you now,' said Lettie Hempstock. 'I gived you a chance. You're on my land. Go away.'
As she said that, my skin felt like it did when I'd rubbed a balloon on my sweater then touched it to my face and hair. Everything prickled and tickled. My hair was soaked, but even wet, it felt like it was starting to stand on end.
Lettie Hempstock held me tightly. 'Don't worry,' she whispered, and I was going to say something, to ask why I shouldn't worry, what I had to be afraid of, when the field we were standing in began to glow.
It glowed golden. Every blade of grass glowed and glimmered, every leaf on every tree. Even the hedges were glowing. It was a warm light. It seemed, to my eyes, as if the soil beneath the grass had transmuted from base matter into pure light, and in the golden glow of the meadow the blue-white lightnings that still crackled around Ursula Monkton seemed much less impressive.
Ursula Monkton rose unsteadily, as if the air had just become hot and was carrying her upwards. Then Lettie Hempstock whispered old words into the world and the meadow exploded into a golden light. I saw Ursula Monkton swept up and away, although I felt no wind, but there had to be a wind, for she was flailing and tipping like a dead leaf in a gale. I watched her tumble into the night, and then Ursula Monkton and her lightnings were gone.
'Come on,' said Lettie Hempstock. 'We should get you in front of a kitchen fire. And a hot bath. You'll catch your death.' She let go of my hand, stopped hugging me, stepped back. The golden glow dimmed, so slowly, and then it was gone, leaving only vanishing glimmers and twinkles in the bushes, like the final moments of the fireworks on Bonfire Night.
'Is she dead?' I asked.
'No.'
'Then she'll come back. And you'll get in trouble.'
'That's as maybe,' said Lettie. 'Are you hungry?'
She asked me, and I knew that I was. I had forgotten, somehow, but now I remembered. I was so hungry it hurt.
'Let's see ...' Lettie was talking as she led me through the fields. 'You're wet through. We'll need to get you something to wear. I'll have a look in the chest of drawers in the green bedroom. I think Cousin Japeth left some of his clothes there when he went off to fight in the Mouse Wars. He wasn't much bigger than you.'
The kitten was licking my fingers with a small, rough tongue.
'I found a kitten,' I said.
'I can see that. She must have followed you back from the fields where you pulled her up.'
'This is that kitten? The same one that I picked?'
'Yup. Did she tell you her name yet?'
'No. Do they do that?'
'Sometimes. If you listen.'
I saw the lights of the Hempstocks' farm in front of us, welcoming, and I was cheered, although I could not understand how we had got from the field we were in to the farmhouse so quickly.
'You were lucky,' said Lettie. 'Fifteen feet further back, and the field belongs to Colin Anders.'
'You would have come anyway,' I told her. 'You would have saved me.'
She squeezed my arm with her hand but she said nothing.
I said, 'Lettie. I don't want to go home.' That was not true. I wanted to go home more than anything, just not to the place I had fled that night. I wanted to go back to the home I had lived in before the opal miner had killed himself in our little white Mini, or before he had run over my kitten.
The ball of dark fur pressed itself into my chest, and I wished she was my kitten, and knew that she was not. The rain had become a drizzle once again.
We splashed through deep puddles, Lettie in her wellington boots, my stinging feet bare. The smell of manure was sharp in the air as we reached the farmyard, and then we walked through a side door and into the huge farmhouse kitchen.
OCEAN_ch9	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	9	4897	25964	Lettie's mother was prodding the huge fireplace with a poker, pushing the burning logs together.
Old Mrs Hempstock was stirring a bulbous pot on the stove with a large wooden spoon. She lifted the spoon to her mouth, blew on it theatrically, sipped from it, pursed her lips, then added a pinch of something and a fistful of something else. She turned down the flame. Then she looked at me, from my wet hair to my bare feet, which were blue with cold. As I stood there, a puddle began to appear on the flagstone floor around me, and the drips of water from my dressing gown splashed into it.
'Hot bath,' said Old Mrs Hempstock. 'Or he'll catch his death.'
'That was what I said,' said Lettie.
Lettie's mother was already hauling a tin bath from beneath the kitchen table, and filling it with steaming water from the enormous black kettle that hung above the fireplace. Pots of cold water were added until she pronounced it the perfect temperature.
'Right. In you go,' said Old Mrs Hempstock. 'Spit-spot.'
I looked at her, horrified. Was I going to have to undress in front of people I didn't know?
'We'll wash your clothes, and dry them for you, and mend that dressing gown,' said Lettie's mother, and she took the dressing gown from me, and she took the kitten, which I had barely realised I was still holding, and then she walked away.
As quickly as possible I shed my red nylon pyjamas - the bottoms were soaked and the legs were now ragged and ripped and would never be whole again. I dipped my fingers into the water, then I climbed in and sat in the tin bath in that reassuring kitchen in front of the huge fire, and I leaned back in the hot water. My feet began to throb as they came back to life. I knew that naked was wrong, but the Hempstocks seemed indifferent to my nakedness: Lettie was gone, and my pyjamas and dressing gown with her; her mother was laying the table, getting out and arranging knives, forks, spoons, little jugs and bigger jugs, carving knives and wooden trenchers, and arranging them.
Old Mrs Hempstock passed me a mug, filled with soup from the black pot on the stove. 'Get that down you. Heat you up from the inside first.'
The soup was rich, and warming. I had never drunk soup in the bath before. It was a perfectly new experience. When I finished the mug, I gave it back to her, and in return she passed me a large cake of white soap and a face flannel and said, 'Now get scrubbin'. Rub the life and the warmth back into your bones.'
She sat down in a rocking chair on the other side of the fire, and rocked gently, not looking at me.
I felt safe. It was as if the essence of grandmotherliness had been condensed into that one place, that one time. I was not at all afraid of Ursula Monkton, whatever she was, not then. Not there.
Young Mrs Hempstock opened an oven door and took out a pie, its shiny crust brown and glistening, and put it on the window ledge to cool.
I dried myself off with a towel they brought me, the fire's heat drying me as much as the towel did, then Lettie Hempstock returned and gave me a voluminous white thing, like a girl's nightdress but made of white cotton, with long arms, and a skirt that draped to the floor, and a white cap. I hesitated to put it on, until I realised what it was: a nightgown. I had seen pictures of them in books. Wee Willie Winkie ran through the town wearing one in every book of nursery rhymes I had ever owned.
I slipped into it. The nightcap was too big for me, and fell down over my face, and Lettie took it away once more.
Dinner was wonderful. There was a joint of beef, with roast potatoes, golden-crisp on the outside and soft and white inside, buttered greens I did not recognise, although I think now that they might have been nettles, roasted carrots, blackened and sweet (I did not think that I liked cooked carrots, so nearly did not eat one, but I was brave, and I tried it, and I liked it, and was disappointed in boiled carrots for the rest of my childhood). For dessert, we had the pie, stuffed with apples and with swollen raisins and crushed nuts, all topped with a thick yellow custard, creamier and richer than anything I had ever tasted at school or at home.
The kitten slept on a cushion beside the fire, until the end of the meal, when it joined a fog-coloured house cat four times its size in a meal of scraps of meat.
While we ate, nothing was said about what had happened to me, or why I was there. The Hempstock ladies talked about the farm - there was the door to the milking shed needed a new coat of paint, a cow named Rhiannon who looked to be getting lame in her rear left leg, the path to be cleared on the way that led down to the reservoir.
'Is it just the three of you?' I asked. 'Aren't there any men?'
'Men!' hooted Old Mrs Hempstock. 'I dunno what blessed good a man would be! Nothing a man could do around this farm that I can't do twice as fast and five times as well.'
Lettie said, 'We've had men here, sometimes. They come and they go. Right now, it's just us.'
Her mother nodded. 'They went off to seek their fate and fortune, mostly, the male Hempstocks. There's never any keeping them here when the call comes. They get a distant look in their eyes and then we've lost them, good and proper. Next chance they gets they're off to towns and even cities, and nothing but an occasional postcard to even show they were here at all.'
Old Mrs Hempstock said, 'His parents are coming! They're driving here. They just passed Parson's elm tree. The badgers saw them.'
'Is she with them?' I asked. 'Ursula Monkton?'
'Her?' said Old Mrs Hempstock, amused. 'That thing? Not her.'
I thought about it for a moment. 'They will make me go back with them, and then she'll lock me in the attic and let my daddy kill me when she gets bored. She said so.'
'She may have told you that, ducks,' said Lettie's mother, 'but she en't going to do it, or anything like it, or my name's not Ginnie Hempstock.'
I liked the name Ginnie, but I did not believe her, and I was not reassured. Soon the door to the kitchen would open, and my father would shout at me, or he would wait until we got into the car, and he would shout at me then, and they would take me back up the lane to my house, and I would be lost.
'Let's see,' said Ginnie Hempstock. 'We could be away when they get here. They could arrive last Tuesday, when there's nobody home.'
'Out of the question,' said the old woman. 'Just complicates things, playing with time ... We could turn the boy into something else, so they'd never find him, look how hard they might.'
I blinked. Was that even possible? I wanted to be turned into something. The kitten had finished its portion of meat scraps (indeed, it seemed to have eaten more than the house cat) and now it leapt into my lap, and began to wash itself.
Ginnie Hempstock got up and went out of the room. I wondered where she was going.
'We can't turn him into anything,' said Lettie, clearing the table of the last of the plates and cutlery. 'His parents will get frantic. And if they are being controlled by the flea, she'll just feed the franticness. Next thing you know, we'll have the police dragging the reservoir, looking for him. Or worse. The ocean.'
The kitten lay down and curled up, wrapping around itself until it was nothing more than a flattened circlet of fluffy black fur. It closed its vivid blue eyes, the colour of an ocean, and it slept, and it purred.
'Well?' said Old Mrs Hempstock. 'What do you suggest, then?'
Lettie thought, pushing her lips together, moving them over to one side. Her head tipped, and I thought she was running through alternatives. Then her face brightened. 'Snip and stitch?' she said.
Old Mrs Hempstock sniffed. 'You're a good girl,' she said. 'I'm not saying you're not. But snippage ... well, you couldn't do that. Not yet. You'd have to cut the edges out exactly, sew them back without the seam showing. And what would you cut out? The flea won't let you snip her. She's not in the fabric. She's outside of it.'
Ginnie Hempstock returned. She was carrying my old dressing gown. 'I put it through the mangle,' she said. 'But it's still damp. That'll make the edges harder to line up. You don't want to do needlework when it's still damp.'
She put the dressing gown down on the table, in front of Old Mrs Hempstock. Then she pulled out from the front pocket of her apron a pair of scissors, black and old, a long needle, and a spool of red thread.
'Rowanberry and red thread, stop a witch in her speed,' I recited. It was something I had read in a book.
'That'd work, and work well,' said Lettie, 'if there was any witches involved in all this. But there's not.'
Old Mrs Hempstock was examining my dressing gown. It was brown and faded, with a sort of sepia tartan across it. It had been a present from my father's parents, my grandparents, several birthdays ago, when it had been comically big on me. 'Probably ...' she said, as if she was talking to herself, 'it would be best if your father was happy for you to stay the night here. But for that to happen, they couldn't be angry with you, or even worried ...'
The black scissors were in her hand and already snip-snip-snipping then, when I heard a knock on the front door, and Ginnie Hempstock got up to answer it.
'Don't let them take me,' I said to Lettie.
'Hush,' she said. 'I'm working here, while grandmother's snipping. You just be sleepy, and at peace. Happy.'
I was far from happy, and not in the slightest bit sleepy. Lettie leaned across the table and took my hand. 'Don't worry,' she said.
And with that the door opened, and my father and my mother were in the kitchen. I wanted to hide, but the kitten shifted, reassuringly, on my lap, and Lettie smiled at me, a reassuring smile.
'We are looking for our son,' my father was saying, 'and we have reason to believe ...' and even as he was saying that, my mother was striding towards me. 'There he is! Darling, we were worried silly!'
'You're in a lot of trouble, young man,' said my father.
Snip! Snip! Snip! went the black scissors, and the irregular section of fabric that Old Mrs Hempstock had been cutting fell to the table.
My parents froze. They stopped talking, stopped moving. My father's mouth was still open, my mother stood on one leg, as unmoving as if she were a shop-window dummy.
'What ... what did you do to them?' I was unsure whether or not I ought to be upset.
Ginnie Hempstock said, 'They're fine. Just a little snipping, then a little sewing, and it'll all be good as gold.' She reached down to the table, pointed to the scrap of faded dressing gown tartan resting upon it. 'That's your dad and you in the hallway, and that's the bathtub. She's snipped that out. So without any of that, there's no reason for your daddy to be angry with you.'
I had not told them about the bathtub. I did not wonder how she knew.
Now the old woman was threading the needle with the red thread. She sighed, theatrically. 'Old eyes,' she said. 'Old eyes.' But she licked the tip of the thread and pushed it through the eye of the needle without any apparent difficulty.
'Lettie. You'll need to know what his toothbrush looks like,' said the old woman. She began to sew the edges of the dressing gown together with tiny, careful stitches.
'What's your toothbrush look like?' asked Lettie. 'Quickly.'
'It's green,' I said. 'Bright green. A sort of appley green. It's not very big. Just a green toothbrush, my size.' I wasn't describing it very well, I knew. I pictured it in my head, tried to find something more about it that I could describe, to set it apart from all other toothbrushes. No good. I imagined it, saw it in my mind's eye, with the other toothbrushes in its red-and-white-spotted beaker above the bathroom sink.
'Got it!' said Lettie. 'Nice job.'
'Very nearly done here,' said Old Mrs Hempstock.
Ginnie Hempstock smiled a huge smile, and it lit up her ruddy round face. Old Mrs Hempstock picked up the scissors and snipped a final time, and a fragment of red thread fell to the tabletop.
My mother's foot came down. She took a step and then she stopped.
My father said, 'Um.'
Ginnie said, '... and it made our Lettie so happy that your boy would come here and stay the night. It's a bit old-fashioned here, I'm afraid.'
The old woman said, 'We've got an inside lavvy nowadays. I don't know how much more modern anybody could be. Outside lavvies and chamber pots were good enough for me.'
'He ate a fine meal,' said Ginnie. 'Didn't you?'
'There was pie,' I told my parents. 'For dessert.'
My father's brow was creased. He looked confused. Then he put his hand into the pocket of his car coat, and pulled out something long and green, with toilet paper wrapped around the top. 'You forgot your toothbrush,' he said. 'Thought you'd want it.'
'Now, if he wants to come home, he can come home,' my mother was saying to Ginnie Hempstock. 'He went to stay the night at the Kovacs' house a few months ago, and by nine he was calling us to come and get him.'
Christopher Kovacs was two years older and a head taller than me, and he lived with his mother in a large cottage opposite the entrance to our lane, by the old green water tower. His mother was divorced. I liked her. She was funny, and drove a VW beetle, the first I had ever seen. Christopher owned many books I had not read, and was a member of the Puffin Club. I could read his Puffin books, but only if I went to his house. He would never let me borrow them.
There was a bunk bed in Christopher's bedroom, although he was an only child. I was given the bottom bunk, the night I stayed there. Once I was in bed, and Christopher Kovacs' mother had said goodnight to us and had turned out the bedroom light and closed the door, he leaned down and began squirting me with a water pistol he had hidden beneath his pillow. I had not known what to do.
'This isn't like when I went to Christopher Kovacs' house,' I told my mother, embarrassed. 'I like it here.'
'What are you wearing?' She stared at my Wee Willie Winkie nightgown in puzzlement.
Ginnie said, 'He had a little accident. He's wearing that while his pyjamas are drying.'
'Oh. I see,' said my mother. 'Well, good night, dear. Have a nice time with your new friend.' She peered down at Lettie. 'What's your name again, dear?'
'Lettie,' said Lettie Hempstock.
'Is it short for Letitia?' asked my mother. 'I knew a Letitia when I was at university. Of course, everybody called her Lettuce.'
Lettie just smiled, and did not say anything at all.
My father put my toothbrush down on the table in front of me. I unwrapped the toilet paper around the head. It was, unmistakably, my green toothbrush. Under his car coat my father was wearing a clean white shirt, and no tie.
I said, 'Thank you.'
'So,' said my mother. 'What time should we be by to pick him up in the morning?'
Ginnie smiled even wider. 'Oh, Lettie will bring him back to you. We should give them some time to play, tomorrow morning. Now, before you go, I baked some scones this afternoon ...'
And she put some scones into a paper bag, which my mother took politely, and Ginnie ushered her and my father out of the door. I held my breath until I heard the sound of the Rover being driven away back up the lane.
'What did you do to them?' I asked. And then, 'Is this really my toothbrush?'
'That,' said Old Mrs Hempstock, with satisfaction in her voice, 'was a very respectable job of snipping and stitching, if you ask me.' She held up my dressing gown: I could not see where she had removed a piece, where she had stitched it up. It was seamless, the mend invisible. She pushed the scrap of fabric that she had cut across the table. 'Here's your evening,' she said. 'You can keep it, if you wish. But if I were you, I'd burn it.'
The rain pattered against the window, and the wind rattled the window frames.
I picked up the jagged-edged sliver of cloth. It was damp. I got up, waking the kitten, who sprang off and vanished into the shadows. I walked over to the fireplace.
'If I burn this,' I asked them, 'will it have really happened? Will my daddy have pushed me down into the bath? Will I forget it ever happened?'
Ginnie Hempstock was no longer smiling. Now she looked concerned. 'What do you want?' she asked.
'I want to remember,' I said. 'Because it happened to me. And I'm still me.' I threw the little scrap of cloth on to the fire.
There was a crackle and the cloth smoked, then it began to burn.
I was under the water. I was holding on to my father's tie. I thought he was going to kill me...
I screamed.
I was lying on the flagstone floor of the Hempstocks' kitchen and I was rolling and screaming. My foot felt like I had trodden, barefoot, on a burning cinder. The pain was intense. There was another pain, too, deep inside my chest, more distant, not as sharp: a discomfort, not a burning.
Ginnie was beside me. 'What's wrong?'
'My foot. It's on fire. It hurts so much.'
She examined it, then licked her finger, touched it to the hole in my sole from which I had pulled the worm, two days before. There was a hissing noise, and the pain in my foot began to ease.
'En't never seen one of these before,' said Ginnie Hempstock. 'How did you get it?'
'There was a worm inside it,' I told her. 'That was how it came with us from the place with the orangey sky. In my foot.' And then I looked at Lettie, who had crouched beside me and was now holding my hand, and I said, 'I brought it back. It was my fault. I'm sorry.'
Old Mrs Hempstock was the last to reach me. She leaned over, pulled the sole of my foot up and into the light. 'Nasty,' she said. 'And very clever. She left the hole inside you so she could use it again. She could have hidden inside you, if she needed to, used you as a door to go home. No wonder she wanted to keep you in the attic. So. Let's strike while the iron's hot, as the soldier said when he entered the laundry.' She prodded the hole in my foot with her finger. It still hurt, but the pain had faded, a little. Now it felt like a throbbing headache inside my foot.
Something fluttered in my chest, like a tiny moth, and then was still.
Old Mrs Hempstock said, 'Can you be brave?'
I did not know. I did not think so. It seemed to me that all I had done so far that night was to run from things. She was holding the needle she had used to sew up my dressing gown, and she grasped it now, not as if she were going to sew with it, but as if she were planning to stab me.
I pulled my foot back. 'What are you going to do?'
Lettie squeezed my hand. 'She's going to make the hole go away,' she said. 'I'll hold your hand. You don't have to look, not if you don't want to.'
'It will hurt,' I said.
'Stuff and nonsense,' said the old woman. She pulled my foot towards her, so the sole was facing her, and stabbed the needle down ... not into my foot, I realised, but into the hole itself.
It did not hurt.
Then she twisted the needle and pulled it back towards her. I watched, amazed, as something that glistened - it seemed black, at first, then translucent, then reflective like mercury - was pulled out from the sole of my foot, on the end of the needle.
I could feel it leaving my leg - it seemed to travel up all the way inside me, up my leg, through my groin and my stomach and into my chest. I felt it leave me with relief: the burning sensation abated, as did my terror.
My heart pounded strangely.
I watched Old Mrs Hempstock reel the thing in, and I was still unable, somehow, to entirely make sense of what I was seeing. It was a hole with nothing around it, over two feet long, thinner than an earthworm, like the shed skin of a translucent snake.
And then she stopped reeling it in. 'Doesn't want to come out,' she said. 'It's holding on.'
There was a coldness in my heart, as if a chip of ice were lodged there. The old woman gave an expert flick of her wrist, and then the glistening thing was dangling from her needle (I found myself thinking now not of mercury, but of the silvery slime trails that snails leave in the garden), and it no longer went into my foot.
She let go of my sole and I pulled my foot back. The tiny round hole had vanished completely, as if it had never been there.
Old Mrs Hempstock cackled with glee. 'Thinks she's so clever,' she said, 'leaving her way home inside the boy. Is that clever? I don't think that's clever. I wouldn't give tuppence for the lot of them.'
Ginnie Hempstock produced an empty jam jar, and the old woman put the bottom of the dangling thing into it, then raised the jar to hold it. At the end, she slipped the glistening invisible trail off the needle and put the lid on the jam jar with a decisive flick of her bony wrist.
'Ha!' she said. And again, 'Ha!'
Lettie said, 'Can I see it?' She took the jam jar, held it up to the light. Inside the jar the thing had begun lazily to uncurl. It seemed to be floating, as if the jar had been filled with water. It changed colour as it caught the light in different ways, sometimes black, sometimes silver.
An experiment that I had found in a book of things boys could do, and which I had, of course, done: if you take an egg, and blacken it completely with soot from a candle flame, and then put it into a clear container filled with saltwater, it will float in the water, and it will seem to be silver: a peculiar, artificial silver, that is only a trick of the light. I thought of that egg, then.
Lettie seemed fascinated. 'You're right. She left her way home inside him. No wonder she didn't want him to leave.'
I said, 'I'm sorry I let go of your hand, Lettie.'
'Oh, hush,' she said. 'It's always too late for sorries, but I appreciate the sentiment. And next time, you'll keep hold of my hand no matter what she throws at us.'
I nodded. The ice chip in my heart seemed to warm then, and melt, and I began to feel whole and safe once more.
'So,' said Ginnie. 'We've got her way home. And we've got the boy safe. That's a good night's work or I don't know what is.'
'But she's got the boy's parents,' said Old Mrs Hempstock. 'And his sister. And we can't just leave her free as a daisy. Remember what happened in Cromwell's day? And before that? When Red Rufus was running around? Fleas attract varmints.' She said it as if it were a natural law.
'That can wait until the morrow,' said Ginnie. 'Now, Lettie. Take the lad and find a room for him to sleep in. He's had a long day.'
The black kitten was curled up on the rocking chair beside the fireplace. 'Can I bring the kitten with me?'
'If you don't,' said Lettie, 'she'll just come and find you.'
Ginnie produced two candlesticks, the kind with big round handles, each one with a shapeless blob of white wax in it. She lit a wooden taper from the kitchen fire, then transferred the flame first to one candlewick and then to the other. She handed a candle to me, the other to Lettie.
'Don't you have electricity?' I asked. There were electric lights in the kitchen, big old-fashioned bulbs hanging from the ceiling, filaments glowing.
'Not in that part of the house,' said Lettie. 'The kitchen's new. Sort of. Put your hand in front of your candle as you walk, so it doesn't blow out.'
She cupped her own hand around the flame as she said this, and I copied her, and walked behind her. The black kitten followed us, out of the kitchen, through a wooden door painted white, down a step, and into the farmhouse.
It was dark, and our candles cast huge shadows, so it looked to me, as we walked, as if everything was moving, pushed and shaped by the shadows: the grandfather clock and the stuffed animals and birds (were they stuffed? I wondered. Did that owl move, or was it just the candle flame that made me think that it had turned its head as we passed?), the hall table, the chairs. All of them moved, and all of them stayed perfectly still. We went up a set of stairs, and then up some steps, and we passed an open window.
Moonlight spilled on to the stairs, brighter than our candle flames. I glanced up through the window and I saw the full moon. The cloudless sky was splashed with stars beyond all counting.
'That's the moon,' I said.
'Gran likes it like that,' said Lettie Hempstock.
'But it was a crescent moon yesterday. And now it's full. And it was raining. It is raining. But now it's not.'
'Gran likes the full moon to shine on this side of the house. She says it's restful, and it reminds her of when she was a girl,' said Lettie. 'And you don't trip on the stairs.'
The kitten followed us up the stairs in a sequence of bounces. It made me smile.
At the top of the house was Lettie's room, and beside it, another room, and it was this room that we entered. A fire blazed in the hearth, illuminating the room with oranges and yellows. The room was warm and inviting. The bed had posts at each corner, and it had its own curtains. I had seen something like it in cartoons, but never in real life.
'There's clothes already set out for you to put on in the morning,' said Lettie. 'I'll be asleep in the room next door if you want me - just shout or knock if you need anything, and I'll come in. Gran said for you to use the inside lavatory, but it's a long way through the house, and you might get lost, so if you need to do your business, there's a chamber pot under the bed, same as there's always been.'
I blew out my candle, and pushed through the curtains into the bed.
The room was warm, but the sheets were cold. The bed shook as something landed on it, and then small feet padded up the blankets, and a warm, furry presence pushed itself into my face and the kitten began, softly, to purr.
There was still a monster in my house, and, in a fragment of time that had, perhaps, been snipped out of reality, my father had pushed me down into the water of the bath and tried, perhaps, to drown me. I had run for miles through the dark. I had seen my father kissing and touching the thing that called itself Ursula Monkton. The dread had not left my soul.
But there was a kitten on my pillow, and it was purring in my face and vibrating gently with every purr, and very soon, I slept.
OCEAN_ch10	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	10	4865	25779	I had strange dreams in that house, that night. I woke myself in the darkness, and I knew only that a dream had scared me so badly I had to wake up or die, and yet, try as I might, I could not remember what I had dreamed. The dream was haunting me: standing behind me, present and invisible, like the back of my head, simultaneously there and not there.
I missed my father and I missed my mother, and I missed my bed in my house, only a mile or so away. I missed yesterday, before Ursula Monkton, before my father's anger, before the bathtub. I wanted that yesterday back again, and I wanted it so badly.
I tried to pull the dream that had upset me so to the front of my mind, but it would not come. There was betrayal in it, I knew, and loss, and time. The dream left me scared to go back to sleep: the fireplace was almost dark now, with only the deep red glow of embers in the hearth to mark that it had once been burning, once had given light.
I climbed down from the four-poster bed, and felt beneath it until I found the heavy china chamber pot. I hitched up my nightgown and I used it. Then I walked to the window and looked out. The moon was still full, but now it was low in the sky, and a dark orange: what my mother called a harvest moon. But things were harvested in autumn, I knew, not in spring.
In the orange moonlight I could see an old woman - I was almost certain it was Old Mrs Hempstock, although it was hard to see her face properly - walking up and down. She had a big long stick she was leaning on as she walked, like a staff. She reminded me of the soldiers on parade I had seen on a trip to London, outside Buckingham Palace, as they marched backwards and forwards on parade.
I watched her, and I was comforted.
I climbed back into my bed in the dark, laid my head on the empty pillow, and thought, I'll never go back to sleep, not now, and then I opened my eyes and saw that it was morning.
There were clothes I had never seen before on a chair by the bed. There were two china jugs of water - one steaming hot, one cold - beside a bowl that I realised was a hand basin, set into a small wooden table. There was a fluffy black kitten on the foot of the bed. It opened its eyes as I sat up; they were a vivid blue-green, unnatural and odd, like the sea in summer, and it mewed a high-pitched, questioning noise. I stroked it, then I got out of bed.
I mixed the hot water and the cold in the basin, and I washed my face and hands. I cleaned my teeth with the cold water. There was no toothpaste, but there was a small round tin box on which was written Max Melton's Remarkably Efficacious Tooth Powder, in old-fashioned letters. I put some of the white powder on my green toothbrush, and cleaned my teeth with it. It tasted minty and lemony in my mouth.
I examined the clothes. They were unlike anything I had ever worn before. There were no underpants. There was a white undershirt, with no buttons but with a long tail. There were brown trousers that stopped at the knees, long white stockings, and a chestnut-coloured jacket with a V cut into in the back, like a swallow's tail. The light brown socks were more like stockings. I put the clothes on as best I could, wishing there were zips or clasps, rather than hooks and buttons and stiff, unyielding buttonholes.
The shoes had silver buckles in the front, but the shoes were too big and did not fit me, so I went out of the room in my stockinged feet, and the kitten followed me.
To reach my room the night before I had walked upstairs and, at the top of the stairs, turned left. Now I turned right, and walked past Lettie's bedroom (the door was ajar, the room was empty) and made for the stairs. But the stairs were not where I remembered them. The corridor ended in a blank wall, and a window that looked out over woodland and fields.
The black kitten with the blue-green eyes mewed, loudly, as if to attract my attention, and turned back down the corridor in a self-important strut, tail held high. It led me down the hall, round a corner and down a passage I had never seen before, to a staircase. The kitten bounced amiably down the stairs, and I followed.
Ginnie Hempstock was standing at the foot of the stairs. 'You slept long and well,' she said, 'We've already milked the cows. Your breakfast is on the table, and there's a saucer of cream by the fireplace for your friend.'
'Where's Lettie, Mrs Hempstock?'
'Off on an errand, getting stuff she may need. It has to go, the thing at your house, or there will be trouble, and worse will follow. She's already bound it once, and it slipped the bounds, so she needs to send it home.'
'I just want Ursula Monkton to go away,' I said. 'I hate her.'
Ginnie Hempstock put out a finger, ran it across my jacket. 'It's not what anyone else hereabouts is wearing these days,' she said, 'but my mam put a little glamour on it, so it's not as if anyone will notice. You can walk around in it all you want, and not a soul will think there's anything odd about it. No shoes?'
'They didn't fit.'
'I'll leave something that will fit you by the back door, then.'
'Thank you.'
She said, 'I don't hate her. She does what she does, according to her nature. She was asleep, she woke up, she's trying to give everyone what they want.'
'She hasn't given me anything I want. She says she wants to put me in the attic.'
'That's as maybe. You were her way here, and it's a dangerous thing to be a door.' She tapped my chest, above my heart, with her forefinger. 'And she was better off where she was. We would have sent her home safely - done it before for her kind a dozen times. But she's headstrong, that one. No teaching them. Right. Your breakfast is on the table. I'll be up in the nine-acre field if anyone needs me.'
There was a bowl of porridge on the kitchen table and beside it, a saucer with a lump of golden honeycomb on it, and a jug of rich yellow cream.
I spooned up a piece of the honeycomb and mixed it into the thick porridge, then I poured in the cream.
There was toast, too, cooked beneath the grill, as my father cooked it, with home-made blackberry jam. There was the best cup of tea I have ever drunk. By the fireplace, the kitten lapped at a saucer of creamy milk, and purred so loudly I could hear it across the room.
I wished I could purr too. I would have purred then.
Lettie came in, carrying a shopping bag, the old-fashioned kind: elderly women used to carry them to the shops, big woven bags that were almost baskets, raffia-work outside and lined with cloth, with rope handles. This basket was almost full. Her cheek had been scratched, and had bled, although the blood had dried. She looked miserable.
'Hello,' I said.
'Well,' she said. 'Let me tell you, if you think that was fun, that wasn't any fun, not one bit. Mandrakes are so loud when you pull them up, and I didn't have earplugs, and I swapped it for a shadow bottle, an old-fashioned one with lots of shadows dissolved in vinegar ...' She buttered some toast, then crushed a lump of golden honeycomb on to it and started munching. 'And that was just to get me to the bazaar, and they aren't even meant to be open yet. But I got most of what I needed there.'
'Can I look?'
'If you want to.'
I looked into the basket. It was filled with broken toys: doll's eyes and heads and hands, cars with no wheels, chipped cat's-eye glass marbles. Lettie reached up and took down the jam jar from the window ledge. Inside it, the silvery translucent wormhole shifted and twisted and spiralled and turned. Lettie dropped it into the shopping bag, with the broken toys. The kitten slept, and ignored us entirely.
Lettie said, 'You don't have to come with me, for this bit. You can stay here while I go and talk to her.'
I thought about it. 'I'd feel safer with you,' I told her.
She did not look happy at this. She said, 'Let's go down to the ocean.' The kitten opened its too-blue eyes and stared at us disinterestedly as we left.
There were black leather boots, like riding boots, waiting for me by the back door. They looked old, but well cared for, and were just my size. I put them on, although I felt more comfortable in sandals. Together, Lettie and I walked down to her ocean, by which I mean the pond.
We sat on the old bench, and looked at the placid brown surface of the pond, and the lily pads, and the scum of duckweed by the water's edge.
'You aren't people,' I said.
'Are too.'
I shook my head. 'I bet you don't actually look like that,' I said. 'Not really.'
Lettie shrugged. 'Nobody looks like what they really are on the inside. You don't. I don't. People are much more complicated than that. It's true of everybody.'
I said, 'Are you a monster? Like Ursula Monkton?'
Lettie threw a pebble into the pond. 'I don't think so,' she said. 'Monsters come in all shapes and sizes. Some of them are things people are scared of. Some of them are things that look like things people used to be scared of a long time ago. Sometimes monsters are things people should be scared of, but they aren't.'
I said, 'People should be scared of Ursula Monkton.'
'P'rhaps. What do you think Ursula Monkton is scared of?'
'Dunno. Why do you think she's scared of anything? She's a grown-up, isn't she? Grown-ups and monsters aren't scared of things.'
'Oh, monsters are scared,' said Lettie. 'And as for grown-ups ...' She stopped talking, rubbed her freckled nose with a finger. Then, 'I'm going to tell you something important. Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truthis, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.' She thought for a moment. Then she smiled. 'Except for Granny, of course.'
We sat there, side by side, on the old wooden bench, not saying anything. I thought about adults. I wondered if that was true: if they were all really children wrapped in adult bodies, like children's books hidden in the middle of dull, long books. The kind with no pictures or conversations.
'I love my ocean,' Lettie said, in the end.
'It's just pretending, though,' I told her, feeling like I was letting childhood down by admitting it. 'Your pond. It's not an ocean. It can't be. Oceans are bigger than seas. Your pond is just a pond.'
'It's as big as it needs to be,' said Lettie Hempstock, nettled. She sighed. 'We'd better get on with sending Ursula whatsername back where she came from.' Then she said, 'I do know what she's scared of. And you know what? I'm scared of them too.'
The kitten was nowhere to be seen when we returned to the kitchen, although the fog-coloured cat was sitting on a windowsill, staring out at the world. The breakfast things had all been tidied up and put away, and my red pyjamas and my dressing gown, neatly folded, were waiting for me on the table, in a large brown paper bag, along with my green toothbrush.
'You won't let her get me, will you?' I asked Lettie.
She shook her head, and together we walked up the winding flinty lane that led to my house and to the thing who called herself Ursula Monkton. I carried the brown-paper bag with my nightwear in it, and Lettie carried her too-big-for-her raffia shopping bag, filled with broken toys, which she had obtained in exchange for a mandrake that screamed, and shadows dissolved in vinegar.
Children, as I have said, use back ways and hidden tracks, while adults take roads and official paths. We went off the road, took a short cut that Lettie knew that led us through some fields, then into the extensive abandoned gardens of a rich man's crumbling house, and then back on to the lane again. We came out just before the place where I had gone over the metal fence.
Lettie sniffed the air. 'No varmints yet,' she said. 'That's good.'
'What are varmints?'
She said only, 'You'll know 'em when you see 'em. And I hope you'll never see 'em.'
'Are we going to sneak in?'
'Why would we do that? We'll go up the drive and through the front door, like gentry.'
We started up the drive. I said, 'Are you going to make a spell and send her away?'
'We don't do spells,' she said. She sounded a little disappointed to admit it. 'We'll do recipes sometimes. But no spells or cantrips. Gran doesn't hold with none of that. She says it's common.'
'So what's the stuff in the shopping bag for, then?'
'It's to stop things travelling when you don't want them to. Mark boundaries.'
In the morning sunlight, my house looked so welcoming and friendly. Warm red bricks, and a red tile roof. Lettie reached into the shopping bag. She took a marble from it, pushed it into the still-damp soil. Then, instead of going into the house, she turned left, walking the edge of the property. By Mr Wollery's vegetable patch we stopped and she took something else from her shopping bag: a headless, legless pink doll-body, with badly chewed hands. She buried it beside the pea plants.
We picked some pea pods, opened them and ate the peas inside. Peas baffled me. I could not understand why grown-ups would take things that tasted so good raw, and put them in tins, and make them revolting.
Lettie placed a toy wolf, the small plastic kind you would find in a children's zoo, or an ark, in the coal shed, beneath a large lump of coal. The coal shed smelled of damp and blackness and of old, crushed forests.
'Will these things make her go away?'
'No.'
'Then what are they for?'
'To stop her going away.'
'But we want her to go away.'
'No. We want her to go home.'
I stared at her: at her short brown hair, her snub nose, her freckles. She looked three or four years older than me. She might have been three or four thousand years older, or a thousand times again. I would have trusted her to the gates of Hell and back. But still ...
'I wish you'd explain properly,' I said. 'You talk in mysteries all the time.'
I was not scared, though, and I could not have told you why I was not scared. I trusted Lettie, just as I had trusted her when we had gone in search of the flapping thing beneath the orange sky. I believed in her, and that meant I would come to no harm while I was with her. I knew it in the way I knew that grass was green, that roses had sharp, woody thorns, that breakfast cereal was sweet.
We went into the house through the front door. It was not locked - unless we went away on holidays, I do not ever remember it being locked - and we went inside.
My sister was practising the piano in the front room. We went in. She heard the noise, stopped playing 'Chopsticks' and turned around.
She looked at me curiously. 'What happened last night?' she asked. 'I thought you were in trouble, but then Mummy and Daddy came back and you were just staying with your friends. Why would they say you were sleeping at your friends'? You don't have any friends.' She noticed Lettie Hempstock then. 'Who's this?'
'My friend,' I told her. 'Where's the horrible monster?'
'Don't call her that,' said my sister. 'She's nice. She's having a lie-down.'
My sister did not say anything about my clothes.
Lettie Hempstock took a broken xylophone from her shopping bag and dropped it on to the scree of toys that had accumulated between the piano and the blue toy box with the detached lid.
'There,' she said. 'Now it's time to go and say hello.'
The first faint stirrings of fear inside my chest, inside my mind. 'Go up to her room, you mean?'
'Yup.'
'What's she doing up there?'
'Still giving people money,' said Lettie. 'Only local people so far. She finds what they think they need and she tries to give it to them. She's doing it to make the world into something she'll be happier in. Somewhere more comfortable for her. Somewhere cleaner. And she doesn't care so much about giving them money, not any more. Now what she cares about more is people hurting.'
As we went up the stairs, Lettie placed something on each step: a clear glass marble with a twist of green inside it; one of the little metal objects we called knucklebones; a bead; a pair of bright blue doll's eyes, connected at the back with white plastic, to make them open or close; a small horseshoe magnet; a black pebble; a badge, the kind that came attached to birthday cards, with I Am Seven on it; a book of matches; a plastic ladybird with a black magnet in the base; a toy car, half squashed, its wheels gone; and last of all, a lead soldier. It was missing a leg.
We were at the top of the stairs. The bedroom door was closed. Lettie said, 'She won't put you in the attic.' Then, without knocking, she opened the door, and she went into the bedroom that had once been mine, and, reluctantly, I followed.
Ursula Monkton was lying on the bed with her eyes closed. She was the first adult woman who was not my mother that I had seen naked, and I glanced at her curiously. But the room was more interesting to me than she was.
It was my old bedroom, but it wasn't. Not any more. There was the little yellow hand basin, just my size, and the walls were still robin's-egg blue, as they had been when it was mine. But now strips of cloth hung from the ceiling, grey, ragged cloth strips, like bandages, some only a foot long, others dangling almost all the way to the floor. The window was open and the wind rustled and pushed them, so they swayed, greyly, and it seemed as if perhaps the room was moving, like a tent or a ship at sea.
'You have to go now,' said Lettie.
Ursula Monkton sat up on the bed, and then she opened her eyes, which were the same grey as the hanging cloths. She said, in a voice that still sounded half asleep, 'I wondered what I would have to do to bring you both here, and now look, you came.'
'You didn't bring us here,' Lettie said. 'We came because we wanted to. And I came to give you one last chance to go.'
'I'm not going now,' said Ursula Monkton, and she sounded petulant, like a very small child who wanted something. 'I've only just got here. I have a house, now. I have pets - his father is just the sweetest thing. I'm making people happy. There is nothing like me anywhere in this whole world. I was looking, just now when you came in. I'm the only one there is. They can't defend themselves. They don't know how. So this is the best place in the whole world.'
She smiled at us both, brightly. She really was pretty, for a grown-up, but when you are seven, beauty is an abstraction, not an imperative. I wonder what I would have done if she had smiled at me like that now: whether I would have handed my mind or my heart or my identity to her for the asking, as my father did.
'You think this world's like that,' said Lettie. 'You think it's easy. But it en't.'
'Of course it is. What are you saying? That you and your family will defend this world against me? You're the only one who ever leaves the borders of your farm - and you tried to bind me without knowing my name. Your mother wouldn't have been that foolish. I'm not scared of you, little girl.'
Lettie reached deep into the shopping bag. She pulled out the jam jar with the translucent wormhole inside, and held it out.
'Here's your way back,' she said. 'I'm being kind, and I'm being nice. Trust me. Take it. I don't think you can get any nearer to home than the place we met you, with the orange sky, but that's far enough. I can't get you from there to where you came from in the first place - I asked Gran, and she says it isn't even there any more - but once you're back, we can find a place for you, somewhere similar. Somewhere you'll be happy. Somewhere you'll be safe.'
Ursula Monkton got off the bed. She stood up and looked down at us. There were no lightnings wreathing her, not any longer, but she was scarier standing naked in that bedroom than she had been floating in the storm. She was an adult - no, more than an adult. She was old. And I have never felt more like a child.
'I'm so happy here,' she said. 'So very, very happy.' And then she said, almost regretfully, 'You're not.'
I heard a sound, a soft, raggedy, flapping sound. The grey cloths began to detach themselves from the ceiling, one by one. They fell, but not in a straight line. They fell towards us, from all over the room, as if we were magnets, pulling them towards our bodies. The first strip of grey cloth landed on the back of my left hand, and it stuck there. I reached out my right hand and grabbed it, and I pulled the cloth off; it adhered, for a moment, and as it pulled off, it made a sucking sound. There was a discoloured patch on the back of my left hand, where the cloth had been, and it was as red as if I had been sucking on it for a long, long time, longer and harder than I ever had in real life, and it was beaded with blood. There were pinpricks of red wetness that smeared as I touched them, and then a long bandage cloth began to attach itself to my legs, and I moved away as a cloth landed on my face and my forehead, and another wrapped itself over my eyes, blinding me, so I pulled at the cloth on my eyes, but now another cloth circled my wrists, bound them together, and my arms were wrapped and bound to my body, and I stumbled, and fell to the floor.
If I pulled against the cloths, they hurt me.
My world was grey. I gave up, then. I lay there, and did not move, concentrated only on breathing through the space the cloth strips had left for my nose. They held me, and they felt alive.
I lay there, and I listened. There was nothing else I could do.
Ursula said, 'I need the boy safe. I promised I'd keep him in the attic, so the attic it shall be. But you, little farm girl. What shall I do with you? Something appropriate. Perhaps I ought to turn you inside out, so your heart and brains and flesh are all on the outside, and the skin side's inside. Then I'll keep you wrapped up in my room here, with your eyes staring forever at the darkness inside yourself. I can do that.'
'No,' said Lettie. She sounded sad, I thought. 'Actually, you can't. And I gave you your chance.'
'You threatened me. Empty threats.'
'I dunt make threats,' said Lettie. 'I really wanted you to have a chance.' And then she said, 'When you looked around the world for things like you, didn't you wonder why there weren't lots of other old things around? No, you never wondered. You were so happy it was just you here, you never stopped to think.
'Gran always calls your sort of thing fleas, Skarthach of the Keep. I mean, she could call you anything. I think she thinks fleas is funny ... She dunt mind your kind. She says you're harmless enough. Just a bit stupid. That's 'cos there are things that eat fleas, in this part of creation. Varmints, Gran calls them. She dunt like them at all. She says they're mean, and they're hard to get rid of. And they're always hungry.'
'I'm not scared,' said Ursula Monkton. She sounded scared. And then she said, 'How did you know my name?'
'Went looking for it this morning. Went looking for other things too. Some boundary markers, to keep you from running too far, getting into more trouble. And a trail of breadcrumbs that leads straight here, to this room. Now, open the bottle, take out the doorway, and let's send you home.'
I waited for Ursula Monkton to respond, but she said nothing. There was no answer. Only the slamming of a door, and the sound of footsteps, fast and pounding, running down the stairs.
Lettie's voice was close to me, and it said, 'She would have been better off staying here and taking me up on my offer.'
I felt her hands tugging at the cloths on my face. They came free with a wet, sucking sound, but they no longer felt alive, and when they came off they fell to the ground and lay there, unmoving. This time there was no blood beaded on my skin. The worst thing that had happened was that my arms and legs had gone to sleep. Lettie helped me to my feet.
She did not look happy.
'Where did she go?' I asked.
'She's followed the trail out of the house. And she's scared. Poor thing. She's so scared.'
'You're scared too.'
'A bit, yes. Right about now she's going to find that she's trapped inside the bounds I put down, I expect,' said Lettie.
We went out of the bedroom. Where the toy soldier at the top of the stairs had been, there was now a rip. That's the best I can describe it: it was as if someone had taken a photograph of the stairs and then torn out the soldier from the photograph. There was nothing in the space where the soldier had been but a dim greyness that hurt my eyes if I looked at it too long.
'What's she scared of?'
'You heard. Varmints.'
'Are you scared of varmints, Lettie?'
She hesitated, just a moment too long. Then she said simply, 'Yes.'
'But you aren't scared of her. Of Ursula.'
'I can't be scared of her. It's just like Gran says. She's like a flea, all puffed up with pride and power and lust, like a flea bloated with blood. But she couldn't have hurt me. I've seen off dozens like her, in my time. One as come through in Cromwell's day - now there was something to talk about. He made folk lonely, that one. They'd hurt themselves just to make the loneliness stop - gouge out their eyes or jump down wells, and all the while that great lummocking thing sits in the cellar of the Duke's Head, looking like a squat toad big as a bulldog.' We were at the bottom of the stairs, walking down the hall.
'How do you know where she went?'
'Oh, she couldn't have gone anywhere but the way I laid out for her.' In the front room my sister was still playing 'Chopsticks' on the piano.

Da da DUM da da
da da DUM da da
da da DUM da DUM da DUM da da ...

We walked out of the front door. 'He was nasty, that one, back in Cromwell's day. But we got him out of there just before the hunger birds came.'
'Hunger birds?'
'What Gran calls varmints. The cleaners.'
They didn't sound bad. I knew that Ursula had been scared of them, but I wasn't. Why would you be scared of cleaners?
OCEAN_ch11	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	11	2364	12423	We caught up with Ursula Monkton on the lawn, by the rose bushes. She was holding the jam jar with the drifting wormhole inside it. She looked strange. She tugged at the lid, and then stopped and looked up at the sky. Then she looked back to the jam jar once more.
She ran over to my beech tree, the one with the rope ladder, and she threw the jam jar as hard as she could against the trunk. If she was trying to break it, she failed. The jar simply bounced off, and landed on the moss that half covered the tangle of roots, and lay there, undamaged.
Ursula Monkton glared at Lettie. 'Why?' she said.
'You know why,' said Lettie.
'Why would you let them in?' She had started to cry, and I felt uncomfortable. I did not know what to do when adults cried. It was something I had only seen twice before in my life: I had seen my grandparents cry, when my aunt had died, in hospital, and I had seen my mother cry. Adults should not weep, I knew. They did not have mothers who would comfort them.
I wondered if Ursula Monkton had ever had a mother. She had mud on her face, and on her knees, and she was wailing.
I heard a sound in the distance, odd and outlandish: a low thrumming, as if someone had plucked at a taut piece of string.
'It won't be me that lets them in,' said Lettie Hempstock. 'They go where they wants to. They usually don't come here because there's nothing for them to eat. Now, there is.'
'Send me back,' said Ursula Monkton. And now I did not think she looked even faintly human. Her face was wrong, somehow: an accidental assemblage of features that simply put me in mind of a human face, like the knobbly grey whorls and lumps on the side of my beech tree, or the patterns in the headboard of the bed at my grandmother's house, which, if I looked at them wrongly in the moonlight, showed me an old man with his mouth open wide, as if he were screaming.
Lettie picked up the jam jar from the green moss, and twisted the lid. 'You've gone and got it stuck tight,' she said. She walked over to the rock path, turned the jam jar upside down, holding it at the bottom, and banged it, lid side down, once, confidently, against the ground. Then she turned it the right side up, and twisted. This time the lid came off in her hand.
She passed the jam jar to Ursula Monkton, who reached inside it and pulled out the translucent thing that had once been a hole in my foot. It writhed and wiggled and flexed seemingly in delight at her touch.
She threw it down. It fell on to the grass, and it grew. Only it didn't grow. It changed: as if it was closer to me than I had thought. I could see through it, from one end to the other. I could have run down it, if the far end of that tunnel had not ended in a bitter orange sky.
As I stared at it, my chest twinged again: an ice-cold feeling, as if I had just eaten so much ice cream that I had chilled my insides.
Ursula Monkton walked towards the tunnel mouth. (How could that be a tunnel? I could not understand it. It was still a glistening translucent silver-black wormhole, on the grass, no more than a foot or so long. It was as if I had zoomed in on something small, I suppose. But it was still a tunnel, and you could have taken a house through it.)
Then she stopped, and she wailed.
 She said, 'The way back.' Only that. 'Incomplete,' she said. 'It's broken. The last of the gate isn't there ...' and she looked around her, troubled and puzzled. She focused on me - not my face, but my chest. And she smiled.
Then she shook. One moment she was an adult woman, naked and muddy, the next, as if she was a flesh-coloured umbrella, she unfurled.
And as she unfurled, she stretched out, and she grabbed me, pulled me up and high off the ground, and I reached out in fear and held her in my turn.
I was holding flesh. I was fifteen feet or more above the ground, as high as a tree.
I was not holding flesh.
I was holding old fabric, a perished, rotting canvas, and, beneath it, I could feel wood. Not good, solid wood, but the kind of old wood I'd find where trees had crumbled, the kind that always felt wet, that I could pull apart with my fingers, soft wood with tiny beetles in it, and woodlice, all filled with threadlike fungus.
It creaked and swayed as it held me.
YOU HAVE BLOCKED THE WAYS, it said to Lettie Hempstock.
'I never blocked nothing,' Lettie said. 'You've got my friend. Put him down.' She was a long way beneath me, and I was scared of heights and I was scared of the creature that was holding me.
THE PATHIS INCOMPLETE. THE WAYS ARE BLOCKED.
'Put him down. Now. Safely.'
HE COMPLETES THE PATH. THE PATHIS INSIDE HIM.
I was certain that I would die, then.
I did not want to die. My parents had told me that I would not really die, not the real me: that nobody really died, when they died; that my kitten and the opal miner had just taken new bodies and would be back again, soon enough. I did not know if it was true or not. I knew only that I was used to being me, and I liked my books and my grandparents and Lettie Hempstock, and that death would take all these things from me.
I WILL OPEN HIM. THE WAY IS BROKEN. IT REMAINS INSIDE HIM.
I would have kicked, but there was nothing to kick against. I pulled with my fingers at the limb holding me, but my fingernails dug into rotting cloth and soft wood, and beneath it, wood as hard as bone; and the thing held me close.
'Let me go!' I shouted. 'Let! Me! Go!'
NO.
'Mummy!' I shouted. 'Daddy!' Then, 'Lettie, make her put me down.'
My parents were not there. Lettie was. She said, 'Skarthach. Put him down. I gave you a choice before. Sending you home will be harder with the end of your tunnel inside him. But we can do it - and Gran can do it if Mum and me can't. So put him down.'
IT IS INSIDE HIM. IT IS NOT A TUNNEL. NOT ANY LONGER. IT IS A DOOR. IT IS A GATE. IT CREPT UP SO NOW IT IS INSIDE HIM. ALL I NEED TO DO TO GET AWAY FROM HERE IS TO REACH INTO HIS CHEST AND PULL OUT HIS BEATING HEART AND FINISH THE PATH.
It was talking without words, the faceless flapping thing, talking directly inside my head, and yet there was something in its words that reminded me of Ursula Monkton's pretty, musical voice. I knew it meant what it said.
'All of your chances are used up,' said Lettie, as if she were telling us that the sky was blue. And she raised two fingers to her lips and, shrill and sweet and piercing sharp, she whistled.
They came.
High in the sky they were, and black, jet black, so black it seemed as if they were specks on my eyes, not real things at all. They had wings, but they were not birds. They were older than birds, and they flew in circles and in loops and whorls, dozens of them, hundreds perhaps, and each flapping unbird slowly, ever so slowly, descended.
I found myself imagining a valley filled with dinosaurs, millions of years ago, who had died in battle, or of disease; imagining first the carcasses of the rotting thunder lizards, bigger than buses, and then the vultures of that aeon: grey-black, naked, winged but featherless; faces from nightmares - beak-like snouts filled with needle-sharp teeth, made for rending and tearing and devouring, and hungry red eyes. These creatures would have descended on the corpses of the great thunder lizards and left nothing but bones.
Huge, they were, and sleek, and ancient, and it hurt my eyes to look at them.
'Now,' said Lettie Hempstock to Ursula Monkton. 'Put him down.'
The thing that held me made no move to drop me. It said nothing, just moved swiftly, like a raggedy tall ship, across the grass towards the tunnel.
I could see the anger in Lettie Hempstock's face, her fists clenched so tightly the knuckles were white. I could see above us the hunger birds circling, circling ...
And then one of them dropped from the sky, dropped faster than the mind could imagine. I felt a rush of air beside me, saw a black, black jaw filled with needles and eyes that burned like gas jets, and I heard a ripping noise, like a curtain being torn apart.
The flying thing swooped back up into the sky with a length of grey cloth between its jaws.
I heard a voice wailing inside my head and out of it, and the voice was Ursula Monkton's.
They descended, then, as if they had all been waiting for the first of their number to move. They fell from the sky on to the thing that held me, nightmares tearing at a nightmare, pulling off strips of fabric, and through it all I heard Ursula Monkton crying.
I ONLY GAVE THEM WHAT THEY NEEDED, she was saying, petulant and afraid. I MADE THEM HAPPY.
'You made my daddy hurt me,' I said, as the thing that was holding me flailed at the nightmares that tore at its fabric. The hunger birds ripped at it, each bird silently tearing away strips of cloth and flapping heavily back into the sky, to wheel and descend again.
I NEVER MADE ANY OF THEM DO ANYTHING, it told me. For a moment I thought it was laughing at me, then the laughter became a scream, so loud it hurt my ears and my mind.
It was as if the wind left the tattered sails then, and the thing that was holding me crumpled slowly to the ground.
I hit the grass hard, skinning my knees and the palms of my hands. Lettie pulled me up, helped me away from the fallen, crumpled remains of what had once called itself Ursula Monkton.
There was still grey cloth, but it was not cloth: it writhed and rolled on the ground around me, blown by no wind that I could perceive, a squirming maggoty mess.
They landed on it like seagulls on a beach of stranded fish, and they tore at it as if they had not eaten for a thousand years and needed to stuff themselves now, as it might be another thousand years or longer before they would eat again. They tore at the grey stuff, and in my mind I could hear it screaming the whole time as they crammed its rotting-canvas flesh into their sharp maws.
Lettie held my arm. She didn't say anything.
We waited.
And when the screaming stopped, I knew that Ursula Monkton was gone for ever.
Once the black creatures had finished devouring the thing on the grass, and when nothing remained, not even the tiniest scrap of grey cloth, then they turned their attentions to the translucent tunnel, which wiggled and wriggled and twitched like a living thing. Several of them grasped it in their claws, and they flew up with it, pulling it into the sky while the rest of them tore at it, demolishing it with their hungry mouths.
I thought that when they finished it they would go away, return to wherever they had come from, but they did not. They descended. I tried to count them as they landed, and I failed. I had thought that there were hundreds of them, but I might have been wrong. There might have been twenty of them. There might have been a thousand. I could not explain it; perhaps they were from a place where such things didn't apply, somewhere outside of time and numbers.
They landed, and I stared at them, but saw nothing but shadows.
So many shadows.
And they were staring at us.
Lettie said, 'You've done what you came here for. You got your prey. You cleaned up. You can go home now.'
The shadows did not move.
She said, 'Go!'
The shadows on the grass stayed exactly where they were. If anything they seemed darker, more real than they had been before.
- You have no power over us.
'Perhaps I don't,' said Lettie. 'But I called you here, and now I'm telling you to go home. You devoured Skarthach of the Keep. You've done your business. Now clear off.'
- We are cleaners. We came to clean.
'Yes, and you've cleaned the thing you came for. Go home.'
 - Not everything, sighed the wind in the rhododendron bushes and the rustle of the grass.
Lettie turned to me, and put her arms around me. 'Come on,' she said. 'Quickly.'
We walked across the lawn, rapidly. 'I'm taking you down to the fairy ring,' she said. 'You have to wait there until I come and get you. Don't leave. Not for anything.'
'Why not?'
'Because something bad could happen to you. I don't think I could get you back to the farmhouse safely, and I can't fix this on my own. But you're safe in the ring. Whatever you see, whatever you hear, don't leave it. Just stay where you are and you'll be fine.'
'It's not a real fairy ring,' I told her. 'That's just our games. It's a green circle of grass.'
'It is what it is,' she said. 'Nothing that wants to hurt you can cross it. Now, stay inside.' She squeezed my hand, and walked me into the green grass circle. Then she ran off, into the rhododendron bushes, and she was gone.
OCEAN_ch12	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	12	3046	15625	The shadows began to gather around the edges of the circle. Formless blotches, only there, really there, when glimpsed from the corners of my eyes. That was when they looked birdlike. That was when they looked hungry.
I have never been as frightened as I was in that grass circle with the dead tree in the centre, on that afternoon. No birds sang, no insects hummed or buzzed. Nothing changed. I heard the rustle of the leaves and the sigh of the grass as the wind passed over it, but Lettie Hempstock was not there, and I heard no voices in the breeze. There was nothing to scare me but shadows, and the shadows were not even properly visible when I looked at them directly.
The sun got lower in the sky, and the shadows blurred into the dusk, became, if anything, more indistinct, so now I was not certain that anything was there at all. But I did not leave the grass circle.
'Hey! Boy!'
I turned. He walked across the lawn towards me. He was dressed as he had been the last time I had seen him: a dinner jacket, a frilly white shirt, a black bow tie. His face was still an alarming cherry-red, as if he had just spent too long on the beach, but his hands were white. He looked like a waxwork, not a person, something you would expect to see in the Chamber of Horrors. He grinned when he saw me looking at him, and now he looked like a waxwork that was smiling, and I swallowed, and wished that the sun was out again.
'Come on, boy,' said the opal miner. 'You're just prolonging the inevitable.'
I did not say a word. I watched him. His shiny black shoes walked up to the grass circle, but they did not cross it.
My heart was pounding so hard in my chest I was certain that he must have heard it. My neck and scalp prickled.
'Boy,' he said, in his sharp South African accent. 'They need to finish this up. It's what they do: they're the carrion kind, the vultures of the void. Their job. Clean up the last remnants of the mess. Nice and neat. Pull you from the world and it will be as if you never existed. Just go with it. It won't hurt.'
I stared at him. Adults only ever said that when it, whatever it happened to be, was going to hurt so much.
The dead man in the dinner jacket turned his head slowly, until his face was looking at mine. His eyes were rolled back in his head, and seemed to be staring blindly at the sky above us, like a sleepwalker.
'She can't save you, your little friend,' he said. 'Your fate was sealed and decided days ago, when their prey used you as a door from its place to this one, and she fastened her path in your heart.'
'I didn't start it!' I told the dead man. 'It's not fair. You started it.'
'Yes,' said the dead man. 'Are you coming?'
I sat down with my back to the tree in the centre of the fairy ring, and I closed my eyes, and I did not move. I remembered poems to distract myself, recited them silently under my breath, mouthing the words but making no sound.
Fury said to the mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law I will prosecute you ...
I had learned that poem by heart at my school. It was told by the mouse from Alice in Wonderland, the mouse she met swimming in the pool of her own tears. In my copy of Alice, the words of the poem curled and shrank like a mouse's tail.
I could say all of the poem in one long breath, and I did, all the way to the inevitable end.
I'll be judge I'll be jury said cunning old Fury I'll try the whole cause and condemn you to death.
When I opened my eyes and looked up, the opal miner was no longer there.
The sky was going grey and the world was losing depth and flattening into twilight. If the shadows were still there I could no longer perceive them; or rather, the whole world had become shadows.
My little sister ran down from the house, calling my name. She stopped before she reached me, and she said, 'What are you doing?'
'Nothing.'
'Daddy's on the phone. He says you have to come and talk to him.'
'No. He doesn't.'
'What?'
'He doesn't say that.'
'If you don't come now, you'll be in trouble.'
 I did not know if this was my sister or not, but I was on the inside of the grass circle, and she was on the outside.
I wished I had brought a book with me, even though it was almost too dark to read. I said the Mouse's pool of tears poem again, in my head. Come I'll take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning I've nothing to do ...
'Where's Ursula?' asked my sister. 'She went up to her room, but she isn't there any more. She's not in the kitchen and she's not in the loo-lahs. I want my tea. I'm hungry.'
'You can make yourself something to eat,' I told her. 'You're not a baby.'
'Where's Ursula?'
She was ripped to shreds by alien vulture-monsters and honestly I think you're one of them or being controlled by them or something.
'Don't know.'
'I'm telling Mummy and Daddy when they get home that you were horrible to me today. You'll get into trouble.' I wondered if this was actually my sister or not. It definitely sounded like her. But she did not take a step over the circle of greener grass, into the ring. She stuck her tongue out at me, and ran back towards the house.
Said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath ...
Deep twilit dusk, all colourless and strained. Mosquitoes whined about my ears and landed, one by one, on my cheeks and my hands. I was glad I was wearing Lettie Hempstock's cousin's strange old-fashioned clothing then, because I had less bare skin exposed. I slapped at the insects as they landed, and some of them flew off. One that didn't fly away, gorging itself on the inside of my wrist, burst when I hit it, leaving a smeared teardrop of my blood to run down the inside of my arm.
There were bats flying above me. I liked bats, always had, but that night there were so many of them, and they made me think of the hunger birds, and I shuddered.
Twilight became, imperceptibly, night, and now I was sitting in a circle that I could no longer see, at the bottom of the garden. Lights, friendly electric lights, went on in the house.
I did not want to be scared of the dark. I was not scared of any real thing. I just did not want to be there any longer, waiting in the darkness for my friend who had run away from me and did not seem to be coming back.
I'll be judge I'll be jury said cunning old Fury I'll try the whole cause and condemn you to death.
I stayed just where I was. I had seen Ursula Monkton torn to shreds, and the shreds devoured by scavengers from outside the universe of things that I understood. If I went out of the circle, I was certain, they would do the same to me.
I moved from Lewis Carroll to Gilbert and Sullivan.
When you're lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is taboo'd by anxiety, I conceive you may use any language you choose to indulge in without impropriety ...
I loved the sound of the words, even if I was not entirely sure what all of them meant.
I needed to wee. I turned my back on the house, took a few steps away from the tree, scared that I would take one step too far and find myself outside the circle. I urinated into the darkness. I had just finished when I was blinded by a torch beam, and my father's voice said, 'What on earth are you doing down here?'
'I ... I'm just down here,' I said.
'Yes. Your sister said. Well, time to come back to the house. Your dinner's on the table.'
I stayed where I was. 'No,' I said, and shook my head.
'Don't be silly.'
'I'm not being silly. I'm staying here.'
'Come on.' And then, more cheerful, 'Come on, Handsome George.' It had been his silly pet name for me, when I was a baby. He even had a song that went with it that he would sing while bouncing me on his lap. It was the best song in the world.
I didn't say anything.
'I'm not going to carry you back to the house,' said my father. There was an edge starting to creep into his voice. 'You're too big for that.'
Yes, I thought. And you'd have to cross into the fairy ring to pick me up.
But the fairy ring seemed foolish now. This was my father, not some waxwork thing that the hunger birds had made to lure me out. It was night. My father had come home from work. It was time.
I said, 'Ursula Monkton's gone away. And she's not ever coming back.'
He sounded irritated, then. 'What did you do? Did you say something horrible to her? Were you rude?'
'No.'
He shone the torch beam on to my face. The light was almost blinding. He seemed to be fighting to keep his temper under control. He said, 'Tell me what you said to her.'
'I didn't say anything to her. She just went away.'
It was true, or almost.
'Come back to the house, now.'
'Please, Daddy. I have to stay here.'
'You come back to the house this minute!' shouted my father, at the top of his voice, and I could not help it: my lower lip shook, my nose started to run, and tears sprang to my eyes. The tears blurred my vision and stung, but they did not fall, and I blinked them away.
I did not know if I was talking to my own father or not.
I said, 'I don't like it when you shout at me.'
'Well, I don't like it when you act like a little animal!' he shouted, and now I was crying, and the tears were running down my face, and I wished that I was anywhere else but there that night.
I had stood up to worse things than him in the last few hours. And suddenly, I knew: I didn't care any more. I looked up at the dark shape behind and above the torch beam, and I said, 'Does it make you feel big to make a little boy cry?' and I knew as I said it that it was the thing I should never have said.
His face, what I could see of it in the reflected torchlight, crumpled, and looked shocked. He opened his mouth to speak, then he closed it again. I could not remember my father ever being at a loss for words, before or after. Only then. I felt terrible. I thought, I will die here soon. I do not want to die with those words on my lips.
But the torch beam was turning away from me. My father said only, 'We'll be up at the house. I'll put your dinner in the oven.'
I watched the torchlight move back across the lawn, past the rose bushes and up towards the house, until it went out, and was lost to sight. I heard the back door open and close again.
Then you get some repose in the form of a doze with hot eyeballs and head ever aching, but your slumbering teems with such horrible dreams that you'd very much better be waking ...
Somebody laughed. I stopped singing, and looked around, but saw nobody.
'""The Nightmare Song"",' a voice said. 'How appropriate.'
She walked closer, until I could see her face. She was still quite naked, and she was smiling. I had seen her torn to pieces a few hours before, but now she was whole. Even so, she looked less solid than any of the other people I had seen that night; I could see the lights of the house glimmering behind her, through her. Her smile had not changed.
'You're dead,' I told her.
'Yes. I was eaten,' said Ursula Monkton.
'You're dead. You aren't real.'
'I was eaten,' she repeated. 'I am nothing. And they have let me out, just for a little while, from the place inside them. It's cold in there, and very empty. But they have promised you to me, so I will have something to play with; something to keep me company in the dark. And after you have been eaten, you too will be nothing. But whatever remains of that nothing will be mine to keep, eaten and together, my toy and my distraction, until the end of time. We'll have such fun.'
A ghost of a hand was raised, and it touched the smile, and it blew me the ghost of Ursula Monkton's kiss.
'I'll be waiting for you,' it said.
A rustle in the rhododendrons behind me and a voice, cheerful and female and young, saying, 'It's okay. Gran fixed it. Everything's taken care of. Come on.'
The moon was visible now above the azalea bush, a bright crescent like a thick nail paring.
I sat down by the dead tree, and did not move.
'Come on, silly. I told you. They've gone home,' said Lettie Hempstock.
'If you're really Lettie Hempstock,' I told her, 'you come here.'
She stayed where she was, a shadowy girl. Then she laughed, and she stretched and she shook, and she was only another shadow: a shadow that filled the night.
'You are hungry,' said the voice in the night, and it was no longer Lettie's voice, not any longer. It might have been the voice inside my own head, but it was speaking aloud. 'You are tired. Your family hates you. You have no friends. And Lettie Hempstock, I regret to tell you, is never coming back.'
I wished I could have seen who was talking. If you have something to fear, rather than something that could be anything, it is easier.
'Nobody cares,' said the voice, so resigned, so practical. 'Now, step out of the circle and come to us. One step is all it will take. Just put one foot across the threshold and we will make all the pain go away for ever: the pain you feel now and the pain that is still to come. It will never happen.'
It was not one voice, not any longer. It was two people talking in unison. Or a hundred people. I could not tell. So many voices.
'How can you be happy in this world? You have a hole in your heart. You have a gateway inside you to lands beyond the world you know. They will call you, as you grow. There can never be a time when you forget them, when you are not, in your heart, questing after something you cannot have, something you cannot even properly imagine, the lack of which will spoil your sleep and your day and your life, until you close your eyes for the final time, until your loved ones give you poison and sell you to anatomy, and even then you will die with a hole inside you, and you will wail and curse at a life ill-lived. But you won't grow. You can come out, and we will end it, cleanly, or you can die in there, of hunger and of fear. And when you are dead, your circle will mean nothing, and we will tear out your heart and take your soul for a keepsake.'
'P'raps it will be like that,' I said, to the darkness and the shadows, 'and p'raps it won't. And p'raps if it is, it would have been like that anyway. I don't care. I'm still going to wait here for Lettie Hempstock, and she's going to come back to me. And if I die here, then I still die waiting for her, and that's a better way to go than you and all you stupid horrible things tearing me to bits because I've got something inside me that I don't even want!'
There was silence. The shadows seemed to have become part of the night once again. I thought over what I'd said, and I knew that it was true. At that moment, for once in my childhood, I was not scared of the dark, and I was perfectly willing to die (as willing as any seven-year-old, certain of his immortality, can be) if I died waiting for Lettie. Because she was my friend.
Time passed. I waited for the night to begin to talk to me again, for people to come, for all the ghosts and monsters of my imagination to stand beyond the circle and call me out, but nothing more happened. Not then. I simply waited.
The moon rose higher. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness. I sang, under my breath, mouthing the words over and over.

You're a regular wreck with a crick in your neck and no wonder you snore for your head's on the floor and you've needles and pins from your sole to your shins and your flesh is a-creep for your left leg's asleep and you've cramp in your toes and a fly on your nose you've got fluff in your lung and a feverish tongue and a thirst that's intense and a general sense that you haven't been sleeping in clover ...

I sang it to myself, the whole song, all the way through, two or three times, and I was relieved that I remembered the words, even if I did not always understand them.
OCEAN_ch13	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	13	2931	15373	When Lettie arrived, the real Lettie, this time, she was carrying a bucket of water. It must have been heavy judging from the way she carried it. She stepped over where the edge of the ring in the grass must have been and she came straight to me.
'Sorry,' she said. 'That took a lot longer than I expected. It didn't want to cooperate, neither, and in the end it took me and Gran to do it, and she did most of the heavy lifting. It wasn't going to argue with her, but it didn't help, and it's not easy ...'
'What?' I asked. 'What are you talking about?'
She put the metal bucket down on the grass beside me without spilling a drop. 'The ocean,' she said. 'It didn't want to go. It gave Gran such a struggle that she said she was going to have to go and have a lie-down afterwards. But we still got it into the bucket in the end.'
The water in the bucket was glowing, emitting a greenish-blue light. I could see Lettie's face by it. I could see the waves and ripples on the surface of the water, watch them crest and splash against the side of the bucket.
'I don't understand.'
'I couldn't get you to the ocean,' she said. 'But there was nothing stopping me bringing the ocean to you.'
I said, 'I'm hungry, Lettie. And I don't like this.'
'Mum's made dinner. But you're going to have to stay hungry for a little bit longer. Were you scared, up here on your own?'
'Yes.'
'Did they try and get you out of the circle?'
'Yes.'
She took my hands in hers, then, and squeezed them. 'But you stayed where you were meant to be, and you didn't listen to them. Well done. That's quality, that is,' and she sounded proud. In that moment I forgot my hunger and I forgot my fear.
'What do I do now?' I asked her.
'Now,' she said, 'you step into the bucket. You don't have to take your shoes off or anything. Just step in.'
It did not even seem a strange request. She let go of one of my hands, kept hold of the other. I thought, I will never let go of your hand, not unless you tell me to. I put one foot into the glimmering water, raising the water level almost to the edge. My foot rested on the tin floor of the bucket. The water was cool on my foot, not cold. I put the other foot into the water and I went down with it, down like a marble statue, and the waves of Lettie Hempstock's ocean closed over my head.
I felt the same shock you would feel if you had stepped backwards, without looking, and had fallen into a swimming pool. I closed my eyes at the water's sting and kept them tightly shut, so tightly.
I could not swim. I did not know where I was, or what was happening, but even under the water I could feel that Lettie was still holding my hand.
I was holding my breath.
I held it until I could hold it no longer, and then I gulped a breath in, expecting to choke, to splutter, to die.
I did not choke. I felt the coldness of the water - if it was water - pour into my nose and my throat, felt it fill my lungs, but that was all it did. It did not hurt me.
I thought, this is the kind of water you can breathe. I thought, perhaps there is just a secret to breathing water, something simple that everyone could do, if only they knew. That was what I thought.
That was the first thing I thought.
The second thing I thought was that I knew everything. Lettie Hempstock's ocean flowed inside me, and it filled the entire universe, from Egg to Rose. I knew that. I knew what Egg was - where the universe began, to the sound of uncreated voices singing in the void - and I knew where Rose was - the peculiar crinkling of space on space into dimensions that fold like origami and blossom like strange orchids, and which would mark the last good time before the eventual end of everything and the next Big Bang, which would be, I knew now, nothing of the kind.
I knew that Old Mrs Hempstock would be here for that one, as she had been for the last.
I saw the world I had walked since my birth and I understood how fragile it was, that the reality I knew was a thin layer of icing on a great dark birthday cake writhing with grubs and nightmares and hunger. I saw the world from above and below. I saw that there were patterns and gates and paths beyond the real. I saw all these things and understood them and they filled me, just as the waters of the ocean filled me.
Everything whispered inside me. Everything spoke to everything, and I knew it all.
I opened my eyes, curious to learn what I would see in the world outside me, if it would be anything like the world inside.
I was hanging deep beneath the water.
I looked down, and the blue world below me receded into darkness. I looked up and the world above me did the same. Nothing was pulling me down deeper, nothing was forcing me towards the surface.
And then I turned my head, a little, to look at her, because she was still holding my hand, she had never let go of my hand, and I saw Lettie Hempstock.
At first, I do not think I knew what I was looking at. I could make no sense of it. Where Ursula Monkton had been made of grey cloth that flapped and snapped and gusted in the storm winds, Lettie Hempstock was made of silken sheets, the colour of ice, filled with tiny flickering candle flames, a hundred hundred candle flames.
Could there be candle flames burning under the water? There could. I knew that, when I was in the ocean, and I even knew how. I understood it just as I understood Dark Matter, the material of the universe that makes up everything that must be there but we cannot find. I found myself thinking of an ocean running beneath the whole universe, like the dark seawater that laps beneath the wooden boards of an old pier: an ocean that stretches from forever to forever and is still small enough to fit inside a bucket, if you have Old Mrs Hempstock to help you, and you ask nicely.
Lettie Hempstock looked like pale silk and candle flames. I wondered how I looked to her, in that place, and knew that even in a place that was nothing but knowledge, that was the one thing I could not know. That if I looked inward I would see only infinite mirrors, staring into myself for eternity.
The silk filled with candle flames moved then, a slow, graceful, under-the-water sort of a movement. The current pulled at it, and now it had arms and the hand that had never let go of mine, and a body and a freckled face that was familiar, and it opened its mouth and, in Lettie Hempstock's voice, it said, 'I'm really sorry.'
'What for?'
She did not reply. The currents of the ocean pulled at my hair and my clothes like summer breezes. I was no longer cold and I knew everything and I was not hungry and the whole big, complicated world was simple and graspable and easy to unlock. I would stay here for the rest of time in the ocean which was the universe which was the soul which was all that mattered. I would stay here for ever.
'You can't,' said Lettie. 'It would destroy you.'
I opened my mouth to tell her that nothing could kill me, not now, but she said, 'Not kill you. Destroy you. Dissolve you. You wouldn't die in here, nothing ever dies in here, but if you stayed here for too long, just a little of you would exist everywhere, all spread out. And that's not a good thing. Never enough of you all together in one place, so there wouldn't be anything left that would think of itself as an ""I"". No point of view any longer, because you'd be an infinite sequence of views and of points ...'
I was going to argue with her. She was wrong, she had to be; I loved that place, that state, that feeling, and I was never going to leave it.
And then my head broke water, and I blinked and coughed, and I was standing thigh deep in the pond at the back of the Hempstocks' farm, and Lettie Hempstock was standing beside me, holding my hand.
I coughed again, and it felt like the water fled my nose, my throat, my lungs. I pulled clean air into my chest, in the light of the huge, full harvest moon that shone on the Hempstocks' red-tiled roof, and for one final perfect moment, I still knew everything: I remember that I knew how to make it so the moon would be full when you needed it to be, and shining just on the back of the house, every night.
I knew everything, but Lettie Hempstock was pulling me up out of the pond.
I was still wearing the strange old-fashioned clothes I had been given that morning, and as I stepped out of the pond, up on to the grass that edged it, I discovered that my clothes and my skin were now perfectly dry. The ocean was back in the pond, and all the knowledge I was left with, as if I had woken from a dream on a summer's day, was that it had not been long ago since I had known everything.
I looked at Lettie in the moonlight. 'Is that how it is for you?' I asked.
'Is what how it is for me?'
'Do you still know everything, all the time?'
She shook her head. She didn't smile. She said, 'Be boring, knowing everything. You have to give all that stuff up if you're going to muck about here.'
'So you used to know everything?'
She wrinkled her nose. 'Everybody did. I told you. It's nothing special, knowing how things work. And you really do have to give it all up if you want to play.'
'To play what?'
'This,' she said. She waved at the house and the sky and the impossible full moon and the skeins and shawls and clusters of bright stars.
I wished I knew what she meant. It was as if she was talking about a dream we had shared. For a moment it was so close in my mind that I could almost touch it.
'You must be so hungry,' said Lettie, and the moment was broken, and yes, I was so hungry, and the hunger took my head and swallowed my lingering dreams.
There was a plate in my place at the table in the farmhouse's huge kitchen. On it was a portion of shepherd's pie, the mashed potato a crusty brown on top, minced meat and vegetables and gravy beneath it. I was scared of eating food outside my home, scared that I might want to leave food I did not like and be told off, or be forced to sit and eat it in minuscule portions until it was gone, as I was at school, but the food at the Hempstocks' was always perfect. It did not scare me.
Ginnie Hempstock was there, bustling about in her apron, rounded and welcoming. I ate without talking, head down, shovelling the welcome food into my mouth. The woman and the girl spoke in low, urgent tones.
'They'll be here soon enough,' said Lettie. 'They aren't stupid. And they won't leave until they've taken the last little bit of what they came here for.'
Her mother sniffed. Her red cheeks were flushed from the heat of the kitchen fire. 'Stuff and nonsense,' she said. 'They're all mouth, they are.'
I had never heard that expression before, and I thought she was telling us that the creatures were just mouths and nothing more. It did not seem unlikely that the shadows were indeed all mouths. I had seen them devour the grey thing that had called itself Ursula Monkton.
My mother's mother would tell me off for eating like a wild animal. 'You must essen, eat,' she would say, 'like a person, not a chazzer, a pig. When animals eat, they fress. People essen. Eat like a person.' Fressen: that was how the hunger birds had taken Ursula Monkton, and it was also, I had no doubt, how they would consume me.
'I've never seen so many of them,' said Lettie. 'When they came here in the old days, there was only a handful of them.'
Ginnie poured me a glass of water. 'That's your own fault,' she told Lettie. 'You put up signals, and called them. Like banging the dinner bell, you were. Not surprising they all came.'
'I just wanted to make sure that she left,' said Lettie.
'Her kind. They're like chickens who get out of the hen-house, and are so proud of themselves and so puffed up for being able to eat all the worms and beetles and caterpillars they want that they never think about foxes,' said Ginnie. 'Anyway, now we've got foxes. And we'll send them all home, same as we did the last times they were sniffing around. We did it before, didn't we?'
'Not really,' said Lettie. 'Either we sent the flea home, and the varmints had nothing to hang around for, like the flea in the cellar in Cromwell's time, or they came and took what they came here for and then they went away. Like the fat flea who made people's dreams come true in Red Rufus's day. They took him and they upped and left. We've never had to get rid of them before.'
Her mother shrugged. 'It's all the same sort of thing. We'll just send them back where they came from.'
'And where do they come from?' asked Lettie.
I had slowed down now, and was making the final fragments of my shepherd's pie last as long as I could, prodding them around the plate slowly with my fork.
'That dunt matter,' said Ginnie. 'They all go back eventually. Probably just get bored of waiting.'
'I tried pushing them,' said Lettie Hempstock, matter-of-factly. 'Couldn't get any traction. I held them with a dome of protection, but that wouldn't have lasted much longer. We're good here - nothing's coming into this farm without our say-so.'
'In or out,' said Ginnie. She removed my empty plate, replaced it with a bowl containing a steaming slice of spotted dick with thick yellow custard drizzled all over it.
I ate it with joy.
I do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I took joy in the things that made me happy. The custard was sweet and creamy in my mouth, the dark swollen currants in the spotted dick were tangy in the cake-thick chewy blandness of the pudding, and perhaps I was going to die that night and perhaps I would never go home again, but it was a good dinner, and I had faith in Lettie Hempstock.
The world outside the kitchen was still waiting. The Hempstocks' fog-coloured house cat - I do not believe I ever knew her name - padded through the kitchen. That reminded me ...
'Mrs Hempstock? Is the kitten still here? The black one with the white ear?'
'Not tonight,' said Ginnie Hempstock. 'She's out and about. She was asleep on the chair in the hall all this afternoon.'
I wished I could stroke her soft fur. I wanted, I realised, to say goodbye.
'Um. I suppose. If I do. Have to die. Tonight,' I started, haltingly, not sure where I was going. I was going to ask for something, I imagine - for them to say goodbye to my mummy and daddy, or to tell my sister that it wasn't fair that nothing bad ever happened to her; that her life was charmed and safe and protected, while I was forever stumbling into disaster. But nothing seemed right, and I was relieved when Ginnie interrupted me.
'Nobody is going to die tonight,' she said, firmly. She took my empty bowl and washed it out in the sink, then she dried her hands on her apron. She took the apron off, went out into the hallway and returned a few moments later wearing a plain brown coat and a pair of large dark green wellington boots.
Lettie seemed less confident than Ginnie. But Lettie, with all her age and wisdom, was a girl, while Ginnie was an adult, and her confidence reassured me. I had faith in them both.
'Where's Old Mrs Hempstock?' I asked.
'Having a lie-down,' said Ginnie. 'She's not as young as she used to be.'
'How old is she?' I asked, not expecting to get an answer. Ginnie just smiled, and Lettie shrugged.
I held Lettie's hand as we left the farmhouse, promising myself that this time I would not let it go.
OCEAN_ch14	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	14	4233	22534	When I entered the farmhouse, through the back door, the moon had been full, and it was a perfect summer's night. When I left, I went with Lettie Hempstock and her mother out of the front door, and the moon was a curved white smile, high in a cloudy sky, and the night was gusty with sudden, undecided spring breezes coming first from one direction then from another; every now and again a gust of wind would contain a sprinkling of rain that never amounted to anything more than that.
We walked through the manure-stinking farmyard and up the lane. We passed a bend in the road. Although it was dark, I knew exactly where we were. This was where it had all begun. It was the corner where the opal miner had parked my family's white Mini, the place he had died all alone, with a face the colour of pomegranate juice, aching for his lost money, on the edge of the Hempstock land where the barriers between life and death were thin.
I said, 'I think we should wake up Old Mrs Hempstock.'
'It doesn't work like that,' said Lettie. 'When she gets tired, she sleeps until she wakes up, on her own. A few minutes or a hundred years. There's no waking her. Might as well try and wake up an atom bomb.'
Ginnie Hempstock stopped, and she planted herself in the middle of the lane, facing away from the farmhouse.
'Right!' she shouted to the night. 'Let's be having you.'
Nothing. A wet wind that gusted and was gone.
Lettie said, 'P'raps they've all gone home ...'
'Be nice if they had,' said Ginnie. 'All this palaver and nonsense.'
I felt guilty. It was, I knew, my fault. If I had kept hold of Lettie's hand, none of this would have happened. Ursula Monkton, the hunger birds, these things were undoubtedly my responsibility. Even what had happened - or now had perhaps no longer happened - in the cold bath, the previous night.
I had a thought.
'Can't you just snip it out? The thing in my heart, that they want? Maybe you could snip it out like your granny snipped things last night?'
Lettie squeezed my hand in the dark.
'Maybe Gran could do that if she was here,' she said. 'I can't. I don't think Mum could either. It's really hard, snipping things out of time: you have to make sure that the edges all line up, and even Gran doesn't always get it right. And this would be harder than that. It's a real thing. I don't think even Gran could take it out of you without hurting your heart. And you need your heart.' Then she said. 'They're coming.'
But I knew something was happening, knew it before she said anything. For the second time I saw the ground begin to glow golden; I watched the trees and the grass, the hedgerows and the willow clumps and the last stray daffodils begin to shine with a burnished half-light. I looked around, half fearful, half with wonder, and I observed that the light was brightest behind the house and over to the west, where the pond was.
I heard the beating of mighty wings, and a series of low thumps. I turned and I saw them: the vultures of the void, the carrion kind, the hunger birds.
They were not shadows any longer, not here, not in this place. They were all too real, and they landed in the darkness, just beyond the golden glow of the ground. They landed in the air and in trees, and they shuffled forward, as close as they could get to the golden ground of the Hempstocks' farm. They were huge - each of them was much bigger than I was.
I would have been hard pressed to describe their faces, though. I could see them, look at them, take in every feature, but the moment I looked away, they were gone, and there was nothing in my mind where the hunger birds had been but tearing beaks and talons, or wriggling tentacles, or hairy, chitinous mandibles. I could not keep their true faces in my head. When I turned away, the only knowledge I retained was that they had been looking directly at me, and that they were ravenous.
'Right, my proud beauties,' said Ginnie Hempstock, loudly. Her hands were on the hips of her brown coat. 'You can't stay here. You know that. Time to get a move on.' And then she said simply, 'Hop it.'
They shifted but they did not move, the innumerable hunger birds, and they began to make a noise. I thought that they were whispering amongst themselves, and then it seemed to me that the noise they were making was an amused chuckling.
I heard their voices, distinct but twining together, so I could not tell which creature was speaking.
- We are hunger birds. We have devoured palaces and worlds and kings and stars. We can stay wherever we wish to stay.
- We perform our function.
- We are necessary.
And they laughed so loudly it sounded like a train approaching. I squeezed Lettie's hand, and she squeezed mine.
- Give us the boy.
Ginnie said, 'You're wasting your time, and you're wasting mine. Go home.'
- We were summoned here. We do not need to leave until we have done what we came here for. We restore things to the way they are meant to be. Would you deprive us of our function?
''Course I will,' said Ginnie. 'You've had your dinner. Now you're just making nuisances of yourselves. Be off with you. Blinking varmints. I wouldn't give tuppence ha'penny for the lot of you. Go home!' and she shook her hand in a flicking gesture.
One of the creatures let out a long, wailing scream of appetite and frustration.
Lettie's hold on my hand was firm. She said, 'He's under our protection. He's on our land. And one step on to our land and that's the end of you. So go away.'
The creatures seemed to huddle closer. There was silence in the Sussex night: only the rustle of leaves in the wind, only the call of a distant owl, only the sigh of the breeze as it passed; but in that silence I could hear the hunger birds conferring, weighing up their options, plotting their course. And in that silence I felt their eyes upon me.
Something in a tree flapped its huge wings and cried out, a shriek that mingled triumph and delight, an affirmative shout of hunger and joy. I felt something in my chest react to the scream, like the tiniest splinter of ice inside my heart.
- We cannot cross the border. This is true. We cannot take the child from your land. This also is true. We cannot hurt your farm or your creatures ...
'That's right. You can't. So get along with you! Go home. Haven't you got a war to be getting back to?'
- We cannot hurt your world, true.
- But we can hurt this one.
One of the hunger birds reached a sharp beak down to the ground at its feet, and began to tear at it - not as a creature that eats earth and grass, but as if it were eating a curtain or a piece of scenery with the world painted on it. Where it devoured the grass, nothing remained - a perfect nothing, only a colour that reminded me of grey, but a formless, pulsing grey like the shifting static of our television screen when you dislodged the aerial cord and the picture had gone completely.
This was the void. Not blackness, not nothingness. This was what lay beneath the thinly painted scrim of reality.
And the hunger birds began to flap and to flock.
They landed on a huge oak tree and they tore at it and they wolfed it down, and in moments the tree was gone, along with everything that had been behind it.
A fox slipped out of a hedgerow and slunk down the lane, its eyes and mask and brush illuminated golden by the farm light. Before it had made it halfway across the road, it had been ripped from the world, and there was only void behind it.
Lettie said, 'What he said before. We have to wake Gran.'
'She won't like that,' said Ginnie. 'Might as well try and wake a-'
'Dunt matter. If we can't wake her up, they'll destroy the whole of this creation.'
Ginnie said only, 'I don't know how.'
A clump of hunger birds flew up to a patch of the night sky where stars could be seen through the breaks in the clouds, and they tore at a kite-shaped constellation I could never have named, and they scratched and they rent and they gulped and they swallowed. In a handful of heartbeats, where the constellation and sky had been, there was now only a pulsing nothingness that hurt my eyes if I looked at it directly.
I was a normal child. Which is to say, I was selfish and I was not entirely convinced of the existence of things that were not me, and I was certain, rock-solid, unshakeably certain, that I was the most important thing in creation. There was nothing that was more important to me than I was.
Even so, I understood what I was seeing. The hunger birds would - no, they were ripping the world away, tearing it into nothing. Soon enough, there would be no world. My mother, my father, my sister, my house, my school friends, my town, my grandparents, London, the Natural History Museum, France, television, books, ancient Egypt - because of me, all these things would be gone, and there would be nothing in their place.
I did not want to die. More than that, I did not want to die as Ursula Monkton had died, beneath the rending talons and beaks of things that might not even have had legs or faces. I did not want to die at all. Understand that.
I let go of Lettie Hempstock's hand and I ran, as fast as I could, knowing that to hesitate, even to slow down, would be to change my mind, which would be the wrong thing, which would be to save my life.
How far did I run? Not far, I suppose, as these things go. Lettie Hempstock was shouting at me to stop, but still I ran, crossing the farmland, where every blade of grass, every pebble on the lane, every willow tree and hazel hedge glowed golden, and I ran towards the darkness. I ran and I hated myself for running, as I had hated myself the time I had jumped from the high board at the swimming pool, knowing there was no going back, that there was no way that this could end in anything but pain.
They took off into the air, the hunger birds, as I ran towards them, as pigeons will rise when you run at them. I knew they were circling.
I stood there in the darkness and I waited for them to descend. I waited for their beaks to tear at my chest, for them to devour my heart.
I stood there for perhaps two heartbeats, and it felt like forever.
It happened. Something slammed into me from behind and knocked me down into the mud on the side of the lane, face first. I saw bursts of light that were not there. The ground hit my stomach, and the wind was knocked out of me.
(A ghost memory rises here: a phantom moment, a shaky reflection in the pool of remembrance. I know how it would have felt when they took my heart. How it felt as the hunger birds, all mouth, tore into my chest and snatched out my heart, still pumping, and devoured it to get at what was hidden inside it. I know how that feels, as if it was truly a part of my life, of my death. And then the memory snips and rips, neatly, and-)
A voice said, 'Idiot! Don't move. Just don't,' and the voice was Lettie Hempstock's, and I could not have moved if I had wanted to. She was on top of me, and she was heavier than I was, and she was pushing me down into the grass and the wet earth, and I could see nothing.
I felt them, though.
I felt them crash into her. She was holding me down, making herself a barrier between me and the world.
I heard Lettie's voice wail in pain.
I felt her shudder and twitch.
A voice said, 'This is unacceptable.'
It was a familiar voice, but still, I could not place it, or move to see who was talking.
Lettie was on top of me, still shaking, but as the voice spoke, she stopped moving. The voice continued, 'On what authority do you harm my child?'
A pause. Then,
- She was between us and our lawful prey.
'You're scavengers. Eaters of offal, of rubbish, of garbage. You're cleaners. Do you think that you can harm my family?'
I knew who was talking. The voice sounded like Lettie's gran, like Old Mrs Hempstock. Like her, I knew, and yet so unlike. If Old Mrs Hempstock had been an empress, she might have talked like that, her voice more stilted and formal and yet more musical than the old-lady voice I knew.
Something wet and warm was soaking my back.
- No ... No, lady.
That was the first time I heard fear or doubt in the voice of one of the hunger birds.
'There are pacts, and there are laws and there are treaties, and you have violated all of them.'
Silence then, and it was louder than words could have been. They had nothing to say.
I felt Lettie's body being rolled off mine, and I looked up to see Ginnie Hempstock's sensible face. She sat on the ground on the edge of the road, and I buried my face in her bosom. She took me in one arm, Lettie in the other.
From the shadows, a hunger bird spoke, with a voice that was not a voice, and it said only,
- We are sorry for your loss.
'Sorry?' The word was spat, not said.
Ginnie Hempstock swayed from side to side, crooning low and wordlessly to me and to her daughter. Her arms were around me. I lifted my head and I looked back at the person speaking, my vision blurred by tears.
I stared at her.
It was Old Mrs Hempstock, I suppose. But it wasn't. It was Lettie's gran in the same way that ...
I mean ...
She shone silver. Her hair was still long, still white, but now she stood as straight as a teenager. My eyes had become used to the darkness, and I could not look at her face to see if it was the face I was familiar with: it was too bright. Magnesium-flare bright. Fireworks Night bright. Midday sun reflecting off a silver coin bright.
I looked at her as long as I could bear to look, and then I turned my head, screwing my eyes tightly shut, unable to see anything but a pulsating after-image.
The voice that was like Old Mrs Hempstock's said, 'Shall I bind you in the heart of a dark star, to feel your pain in a place where every fragment of a moment lasts a thousand years? Shall I invoke the compacts of Creation, and have you all removed from the list of created things, so there never will have been any hunger birds, and anything that wishes to traipse from world to world can do so with impunity?'
I listened for a reply, but heard nothing. Only a whimper, a mewl of pain or of frustration.
'I'm done with you. I will deal with you in my own time and in my own way. For now I must tend to the children.'
- Yes, lady.
- Thank you, lady.
'Not so fast. Nobody's going anywhere before you put all those things back like they was. There's Boötes missing from the sky. There's an oak tree gone, and a fox. You put them all back, the way they were.' And then the silvery empress added, in a voice that was now also unmistakably Old Mrs Hempstock's, 'Varmints.'
Somebody was humming a tune. I realised, as if from a long way away, that it was me, at the same moment that I remembered what the tune was:

Girls and boys come out to play,
the moon doth shine as bright as day.
Leave your supper and leave your meat,
and join your playfellows in the street.
Come with a whoop and come with a call.
Come with a whole heart or not at all ...

I held on to Ginnie Hempstock. She smelled like a farm and like a kitchen, like animals and like food. She smelled very real, and the realness was what I needed at that moment.
I reached out a hand, tentatively touched Lettie's shoulder. She did not move or respond.
Ginnie started speaking, then, but at first I did not know if she was talking to herself or to Lettie or to me. 'They overstepped their bounds,' she said. 'They could have hurt you, child, and it would have meant nothing. They could have hurt this world without anything being said - it's only a world, after all, and they're just sand grains in the desert, worlds. But Lettie's a Hempstock. She's outside of their dominion, my little one. And they hurted her.'
I looked at Lettie. Her head had flopped down, hiding her face. Her eyes were closed.
'Is she going to be all right?' I asked.
Ginnie didn't reply, just hugged us both the tighter to her bosom, and rocked, and crooned a wordless song.
The farm and its land no longer glowed golden. I could not feel anything in the shadows watching me, not any longer.
'Don't you worry,' said an old voice, now familiar once more. 'You're safe as houses. Safer'n most houses I've seen. They've gone.'
'They'll come back again,' I said. 'They want my heart.'
'They'd not come back to this world again for all the tea in China,' said Old Mrs Hempstock. 'Not that they've got any use for tea - or for China - no more than a carrion crow does.'
Why had I thought her dressed in silver? She wore a much-patched grey dressing gown over what had to have been a nightie, but a nightie of a kind that had not been fashionable for several hundred years.
The old woman put a hand on her granddaughter's pale forehead, lifted it up, then let it go.
Lettie's mother shook her head. 'It's over,' she said.
I understood it then, at the last, and felt foolish for not understanding it sooner. The girl beside me, on her mother's lap, at her mother's breast, had given her life for mine.
'They were meant to hurt me, not her,' I said.
'No reason they should've taken either of you,' said the old lady, with a sniff. I felt guilt then, guilt beyond anything I had ever felt before.
'We should get her to a hospital,' I said, hopefully. 'We can call a doctor. Maybe they can make her better.'
Ginnie shook her head.
'Is she dead?' I asked.
'Dead?' repeated the old woman in the dressing gown. She sounded offended. 'Has hif,' she said, grandly aspirating each aitch as if that were the only way to convey the gravity of her words. 'Has hif han 'Empstock would hever do hanything so ... common ...'
'She's hurt,' said Ginnie Hempstock, cuddling me close. 'Hurt as badly as she can be hurt. She's so close to death as makes no odds if we don't do something about it, and quickly.' A final hug, then, 'Off with you, now.' I clambered reluctantly from her lap, and stood up.
Ginnie Hempstock rose to her feet, her daughter's body limp in her arms. Lettie lolled and was jogged like a rag doll as her mother got up, and I stared at her, shocked beyond measure.
I said, 'It was my fault. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.'
Old Mrs Hempstock said, 'You meant well,' but Ginnie Hempstock said nothing at all. She walked down the lane towards the farm, and then she turned off behind the milking shed. I thought that Lettie was too big to be carried, but Ginnie carried her as if she weighed no more than a kitten, her head and upper body resting on Ginnie's shoulder, like a sleeping infant being taken upstairs to bed. Ginnie carried her down that path, and beside the hedge, and back, and back, until we reached the pond.
There were no breezes back there, and the night was perfectly still; our path was lit by moonlight and nothing more; the pond, when we got there, was just a pond. No golden, glimmering light. No magical full moon. It was black and dull, with the moon, the true moon, the quarter-moon, reflected in it.
I stopped at the edge of the pond, and Old Mrs Hempstock stopped beside me.
But Ginnie Hempstock kept walking.
She staggered down into the pond, until she was wading thigh deep, her coat and skirt floating on the water as she waded, breaking the reflected moon into dozens of tiny moons that scattered and re-formed around her.
At the centre of the pond, with the black water above her hips, she stopped. She took Lettie from her shoulder, so the girl's body was supported at the head and at the knees by Ginnie Hempstock's practical hands; then slowly, so very slowly, she laid Lettie down in the water.
The girl's body floated on the surface of the pond.
Ginnie took a step back, and then another, never looking away from her daughter.
I heard a rushing noise, as if of an enormous wind coming towards us.
Lettie's body shook.
There was no breeze, but now there were whitecaps on the surface of the pond. I saw waves, gentle, lapping waves at first, and then bigger waves that broke and slapped at the edge of the pond. One wave crested and crashed down close to me, splashing my clothes and face. I could taste the water's wetness on my lips, and it was salt.
I whispered, 'I'm sorry, Lettie.'
I should have been able to see the other side of the pond. I had seen it a few moments before. But the crashing waves had taken it away, and I could see nothing beyond Lettie's floating body but the vastness of the lonely ocean, and the dark.
The waves grew bigger. The water began to glow in the moonlight, as it had glowed when it was in the bucket, a pale, perfect blue. The black shape on the surface of the water was the body of the girl who had saved my life.
Bony fingers rested on my shoulder. 'What are you apologising for, boy? For killing her?'
I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.
'She's not dead. You didn't kill her, nor did the hunger birds, although they did their best to get to you through her. She's been given to her ocean. One day, in its own time, the ocean will give her back.'
I thought of corpses and of skeletons with pearls for eyes. I thought of mermaids with tails that flicked when they moved, like my goldfish's tail had flicked before my goldfish had stopped moving, to lie, belly up, like Lettie, on the top of the water. I said, 'Will she be the same?'
The old woman guffawed, as if I had said the funniest thing in the universe. 'Nothing's ever the same,' she said. 'Be it a second later or a hundred years. It's always churning and roiling. And people change as much as oceans.'
Ginnie clambered out of the water, and she stood at the water's edge beside me, her head bowed. The waves crashed and smacked and splashed and retreated. There was a distant rumble that became a louder and louder rumble: something was coming towards us, across the ocean. From miles away, from hundreds and hundreds of miles away it came: a thin white line etched in the glowing blue, and it grew as it approached.
The great wave came, and the world rumbled, and I looked up as it reached us: it was taller than trees, than houses, than mind or eyes could hold, than heart could follow.
Only when it reached Lettie Hempstock's floating body did the enormous wave crash down. I expected to be soaked, or worse, to be swept away by the angry ocean water, and I raised my arm to cover my face.
There was no splash of breakers, no deafening crash, and when I lowered my arm I could see nothing but the still black water of a pond in the night, and nothing on the surface of the pond but a smattering of lily pads and the thoughtful, incomplete reflection of the moon.
Old Mrs Hempstock was gone too. I had thought that she was standing beside me, but only Ginnie stood there, next to me, staring down silently into the dark mirror of the little pond.
'Right,' she said. 'I'll take you home.'
OCEAN_ch15	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	15	1776	9354	There was a Land Rover parked behind the cowshed. The doors were open and the ignition key was in the lock. I sat on the newspaper-covered passenger seat and watched Ginnie Hempstock turn the key. The engine sputtered a few times before it started.
I had not imagined any of the Hempstocks driving. I said, 'I didn't know you had a car.'
'Lots of things you don't know,' said Mrs Hempstock, tartly. Then she glanced at me more gently and said, 'You can't know everything.' She backed the Land Rover up and it bumped its way forward across the ruts and the puddles of the back of the farmyard.
There was something on my mind.
'Old Mrs Hempstock says that Lettie isn't dead,' I said. 'But she looked dead. I think she is actually dead. I don't think it's true that she's not dead.'
Ginnie looked like she was going to say something about the nature of truth, but all she said was, 'She's hurt. Very badly hurt. The ocean has taken her. Honestly, I don't know if it will ever give her back. But we can hope, can't we?'
'Yes.' I squeezed my hands into fists, and I hoped as hard as I knew how.
We bumped and jolted up the lane at fifteen miles per hour.
I said, 'Was she - is she - really your daughter?' I didn't know, I still don't know, why I asked her that. Perhaps I just wanted to know more about the girl who had saved my life, who had rescued me more than once. I didn't know anything about her.
'More or less,' said Ginnie. 'The men Hempstocks, my brothers, they went out into the world, and they had babies who've had babies. There are Hempstock women out there in your world, and I'll wager each of them is a wonder in her own way. But only Gran and me and Lettie are the pure thing.'
'She didn't have a daddy?' I asked.
'No.'
'Did you have a daddy?'
'You're all questions, aren't you? No, love. We never went in for that sort of thing. You only need men if you want to breed more men.'
I said, 'You don't have to take me home. I could stay with you. I could wait until Lettie comes back from the ocean. I could work on your farm, and carry stuff, and learn to drive a tractor.'
She said, 'No,' but she said it kindly. 'You get on with your own life. Lettie gave it to you. You just have to grow up and try and be worth it.'
A flash of resentment. It's hard enough being alive, trying to survive in the world and find your place in it, to do the things you need to do to get by, without wondering if the thing you just did, whatever it was, was worth someone having, if not died, then having given up her life. It wasn't fair.
'Life's not fair,' said Ginnie, as if I had spoken aloud.
She turned into our driveway, pulled up outside the front door. I got out and she did too.
'Better make it easier for you to go home,' she said.
Mrs Hempstock rang the doorbell, although the door was never locked, and industriously scraped the soles of her wellington boots on the doormat until my mother opened the door. She was dressed for bed, and wearing her quilted pink dressing gown.
'Here he is,' said Ginnie. 'Safe and sound, the soldier back from the wars. He had a lovely time at our Lettie's going-away party, but now it's time for this young man to get his rest.'
My mother looked blank - almost confused - and then the confusion was replaced by a smile, as if the world had just reconfigured itself into a form that made sense.
'Oh, you didn't have to bring him back,' said my mother. 'One of us would have come and picked him up.' Then she looked down at me. 'What do you say to Mrs Hempstock, darling?'
I said it automatically. 'Thank-you-for-having-me.'
My mother said, 'Very good, dear.' Then, 'Lettie's going away?'
'To Australia,' said Ginnie. 'To be with her father. We'll miss having this little fellow over to play, but, well, we'll let you know when Lettie comes back. He can come and play then.'
I was getting tired. The party had been fun, although I could not remember much about it. I knew that I would not visit the Hempstock farm again, though. Not unless Lettie was there.
Australia was a long, long way away. I wondered how long it would be until she came back from Australia with her father. Years, I supposed. Australia was on the other side of the world, across the ocean ...
A small part of my mind remembered an alternative pattern of events, and then lost it, as if I had woken from a comfortable sleep, and looked around, pulled the bedclothes over me and returned to my dream.
Mrs Hempstock got back into her ancient Land Rover, so bespattered with mud (I could now see, in the light above the front door) that there was almost no trace of the original paintwork visible, and she backed it up, down the drive, towards the lane.
My mother seemed unbothered that I had returned home in fancy dress clothes at almost eleven at night. She said, 'I have some bad news, dear.'
'What's that?'
'Ursula's had to leave. Family matters. Pressing family matters. She's already left. I know how much you children liked her.'
I knew that I didn't like her, but I said nothing.
There was now nobody sleeping in my bedroom at the top of the stairs. My mother asked if I would like my room back for a while. I said no, unsure of why I was saying no. I could not remember why I disliked Ursula Monkton so much - indeed, I felt faintly guilty for disliking her so absolutely and so irrationally - but I had no desire to return to that bedroom, despite the little yellow hand basin just my size, and I remained in the shared bedroom until our family moved out of that house half a decade later (we children protesting, the adults I think just relieved that their financial difficulties were over).
The house was demolished after we moved out. I would not go and see it standing empty, and refused to witness the demolition. There was too much of my life bound up in those bricks and tiles, those drainpipes and walls.
Years later, my sister, now an adult herself, confided in me that she believed that our mother had fired Ursula Monkton (whom she remembered, so fondly, as the nice one in a sequence of grumpy childminders) because our father was having an affair with her. It was possible, I agreed. Our parents were both still alive then, and I could have asked them, but I didn't.
My father did not mention the events of those nights, not then, not later.
If I took anything from him and my childhood, it was the resolve not to shout at people, and especially not to shout at children.
I finally made friends with my father when I entered my twenties. We had so little in common when I was a boy, and I am certain I had been a disappointment to him. He did not ask for a child with a book, off in its own world. He wanted a son who did what he had done: swam and boxed and played rugby, and drove cars at speed with abandon and joy, but that was not what he had wound up with.
I did not ever go down the lane all the way to the end. I did not think of the white Mini. When I thought of the opal miner, it was in the context of the two rough raw opal rocks that sat on our mantelpiece, and in my memory he always wore a checked shirt and jeans. His face and arms were tan, not the cherry-red of monoxide poisoning, and he had no bow tie.
Monster, the ginger tomcat the opal miner had left us, had wandered off to be fed by other families, and although we saw him, from time to time, prowling the ditches and trees at the end of the lane, he would not ever come when we called. I was relieved by this, I think. He had never been our cat. We knew it, and so did he.
A story only matters, I suspect, to the extent that the people in the story change. But I was seven when all of these things happened, and I was the same person at the end of it that I was at the beginning, wasn't I? So was everyone else. People don't change.
Some things changed, though.
A month or so after the events here, and five years before the ramshackle world I lived in was demolished and replaced by trim, squat, regular houses containing smart young people who worked in the City but lived in my town, who made money by moving money from place to place but who did not build or dig or farm or weave, and nine years before I would kiss smiling Callie Anders ...
I came home from school. The month was May, or perhaps early June. She was waiting by the back door as if she knew precisely where she was and who she was looking for: a young black cat, larger than a kitten now, with a white splodge over one ear, and with eyes of an intense and unusual greenish-blue.
She followed me into the house.
I fed her with an unused can of Monster's cat food, which I spooned into Monster's dusty bowl.
My parents, who had never noticed the ginger tom's disappearance, did not initially notice the arrival of the new kitten-cat, and by the time my father commented on her existence, she had been living with us for several weeks, exploring the garden until I came home from school, then staying near me while I read or played. At night she would wait beneath the bed until the lights were turned out, then she would accommodate herself on the pillow beside me, grooming my hair, and purring, so quietly as never to disturb my sister.
I would fall asleep with my face pressed into her fur, while her deep electrical purr vibrated softly against my cheek.
She had such unusual eyes. They made me think of the seaside, and so I called her Ocean, and could not have told you why.
OCEAN_ch16	OCEAN	The Ocean at the End of the Lane	16	1987	10386	I sat on the dilapidated green bench beside the duckpond, at the back of the red-brick farmhouse, and I thought about my kitten.
I only remembered that Ocean had grown into a cat, and that I had adored her for years. I wondered what had happened to her, and then I thought, it doesn't matter that I can't remember the details any longer: death happened to her. Death happens to all of us.
A door opened in the farmhouse, and I heard feet on the path. Soon the old woman sat down beside me. 'I brung you a cup of tea,' she said. 'And a cheese and tomato sandwich. You've been out here for quite a while. I thought you'd probably fallen in.'
'I sort of did,' I told her. And, 'Thank you.' It had become dusk, without my noticing, while I had been sitting there.
I took the tea, and sipped it, and I looked at the woman, more carefully this time. I compared her to my memories of forty years ago. I said, 'You aren't Lettie's mother. You're her grandmother, aren't you? You're Old Mrs Hempstock.'
'That's right,' she said, unperturbed. 'Eat your sandwich.'
I took a bite of my sandwich. It was good, really good. Freshly baked bread, sharp, salty cheese, the kind of tomatoes that actually taste like something.
I was awash in memory, and I wanted to know what it meant, what it all meant. I said, 'Is it true?' and felt foolish. Of all the questions I could have asked, I had asked that.
Old Mrs Hempstock shrugged. 'What you remembered? Probably. More or less. Different people remember things differently, and you'll not get any two people to remember anything the same, whether they were there or not. You stand two of you lot next to each other, and they could be continents away for all it means anything.'
There was another question I needed answered. I said, 'Why did I come here?'
She looked at me as if it were a trick question. 'The funeral,' she said. 'You wanted to get away from everyone and be on your own. So first of all you drove back to the place you'd lived in as a boy, and when that didn't give you what you missed, you came here, like you always do.'
'Like I always do?' I drank some more tea. It was still hot, and strong enough: a perfect cup of builder's tea. You could stand a spoon straight up in it, as my father always said of a cup of tea of which he approved.
'Like you always do,' she repeated.
'No,' I said. 'I haven't been here since, well, since Lettie went to Australia. Her going-away party.' And then I said, 'Which never happened. You know what I mean.'
'You come back sometimes,' she said. 'You were here once when you were twenty-four, I remember. You had two young children, and you were so scared. You came here before you left these parts; you were, what, in your thirties then? I fed you a good meal in the kitchen, and you told me about your dreams and the art you were making.'
'I don't remember.'
She pushed the hair from her eyes. 'It's easier that way.'
I sipped my tea, and finished the sandwich. The mug was white, and so was the plate. The endless summer evening was coming to an end.
I asked her again, 'Why did I come here?'
'Lettie wanted you to,' said somebody.
The person who said that was walking around the pond: a woman in a brown coat, wearing wellington boots. I looked at her in confusion. She looked younger than I was now. I remembered her as vast, as adult, but now I saw she was only in her late thirties. I remembered her as stout, but she was buxom, and attractive in an apple-cheeked sort of a way. She was still Ginnie Hempstock, Lettie's mother, and she looked, I was certain, just as she had looked forty-something years ago.
She sat down on the bench on the other side of me, so I was flanked by Hempstock women. She said, 'I think Lettie just wants to know if it was worth it.'
'If what was worth it?'
'You,' said the old woman, tartly.
'Lettie did a very big thing for you,' said Ginnie. 'I think she mostly wants to find out what happened next, and whether it was worth everything she did.'
'She ... sacrificed herself for me.'
'After a fashion, dear,' said Ginnie. 'The hunger birds tore out your heart. You screamed so piteously as you died. She couldn't abide that. She had to do something.'
I tried to remember this. I said, 'That isn't how I remember it.'
The old lady sniffed. 'Didn't I just say you'll never get any two people to remember anything the same?' she asked.
'Can I talk to her?'
'She's sleeping,' said Lettie's mother. 'She's healing. She's not talking yet.'
'Not until she's done where she is,' said Lettie's grandmother, gesturing, but I could not tell if she was pointing to the duckpond or to the sky.
'When will that be?'
'When she's good and ready,' said the old woman, as her daughter said, 'Soon.'
'Well,' I said. 'If she brought me here to look at me, let her look at me,' and as I said it, I knew that it had already happened. How long had I been sitting on that bench? As I had been remembering her, she had been examining me. 'Oh. She did already, didn't she?'
'Yes, dear.'
'And did I pass?'
The face of the old woman on my right was unreadable in the gathering dusk. On my left the younger woman said, 'You don't pass or fail at being a person, dear.'
I put the empty cup and plate down on the ground.
Ginnie Hempstock said, 'I think you're doing better than you were the last time we saw you. You're growing a new heart, for a start.'
In my memory she was a mountain, this woman, and I had sobbed and shivered on her bosom. Now she was smaller than I was, and I could not imagine her comforting me, not in that way.
The moon was full, in the sky above the pond. I could not for the life of me remember what phase the moon had been in the last time I had noticed it. I could not actually remember the last time I had done more than glance at the moon.
'So what will happen now?'
'Same thing as happens every other time you've come here,' said the old woman. 'You go home.'
'I don't know where that is any more,' I told them.
'You always say that,' said Ginnie.
In my memory Lettie Hempstock was still a full head taller than I was. She was eleven, after all. I wondered what I would see - who I would see - if she stood before me now.
The moon in the duckpond was full as well, and I found myself, unbidden, thinking of the holy fools in the old story, the ones who went fishing in a lake for the moon, with nets, convinced that the reflection in the water was nearer and easier to catch than the globe that hung in the sky.
And, of course, it is.
I got up and walked a few steps to the edge of the pond. 'Lettie,' I said, trying to ignore the two women behind me. 'Thank you for saving my life.'
'She should never've taken you with her in the first place, when she went off to find the start of it all,' sniffed Old Mrs Hempstock. 'Nothing to stop her sorting it all out on her own. Didn't need to take you along for company, silly thing. Well, that'll learn her for next time.'
I turned and looked at Old Mrs Hempstock. 'Do you really remember when the moon was made?' I asked.
'I remember lots of things,' she said.
'Will I come back here again?' I asked.
'That's not for you to know,' said the old woman.
'Get along now,' said Ginnie Hempstock, gently. 'There's people who are wondering where you've got to.'
And when she mentioned them, I realised, with an awkward horror, that my sister, her husband, her children and my own, all the well-wishers and mourners and visitors, would be puzzling over what had become of me. Still, if there was a day that they would find my absent ways easy to forgive, it was today. It had been a long day and a hard one. I was glad that it was over.
I said, 'I hope that I haven't been a bother.'
'No, dear,' said the old woman. 'No bother at all.'
I heard a cat miaow. A moment later, it sauntered out of the shadows and into a patch of bright moonlight. It approached me confidently, pushed its head against my shoe.
I crouched beside it and scratched its forehead, stroked its back. It was a beautiful cat, black, or so I imagined, the moonlight having swallowed the colour of things. It had a white spot over one ear.
I said, 'I used to have a cat like this. She was beautiful. I don't actually remember what happened to her.'
'You brought her back to us,' said Ginnie Hempstock. And then she touched my shoulder with her hand, squeezing it for a heartbeat, and she walked away.
I picked up my plate and my mug, and I carried them along the path with me as we made our way back to the house, the old woman and I.
'The moon does shine as bright as day,' I said. 'Like in the song.'
'It's good to have a full moon,' she agreed.
I said, 'It's funny. For a moment, I thought there were two of you. Isn't that odd?'
'It's just me,' said the old woman. 'It's only ever just me.'
'I know,' I said. 'Of course it is.'
I was going to take the plate and mug into the kitchen, but she stopped me at the farmhouse door. 'You ought to get back to your family now,' she said. 'They'll be sending out a search party.'
'They'll forgive me,' I said. I hoped that they would. My sister would be concerned, and there would be people I barely knew disappointed not to have told me how very, very sorry they were for my loss. 'You've been so kind. Letting me sit and think here. By the pond. I'm very grateful.'
'Stuff and nonsense,' she said. 'Nothing kind about it.'
'Next time Lettie writes from Australia,' I said, 'please tell her I said hello.'
'I will,' she said. 'She'll be glad you thought of her.'
I got into the car and started the engine. The old woman stood in the doorway, watching me, politely, until I had turned the car around and was on my way up the lane.
I looked back at the farmhouse in my rear-view mirror, and a trick of the light made it seem as if two moons hung in the sky above it, like a pair of eyes watching me from above: one moon perfectly full and round, the other, its twin on the other side of the sky, a half-moon.
Curiously I turned in my seat and looked back: a single half-moon hung over the farmhouse, peaceful and pale and perfect.
I wondered where the illusion of the second moon had come from, but I only wondered for a moment, and then I dismissed it from my thoughts. Perhaps it was an after-image, I decided, or a ghost: something that had stirred in my mind for a moment, so powerfully that I believed it to be real, but now was gone, and faded into the past like a memory forgotten, or a shadow into the dusk.
OFG_ch1	OFG	Odd and the Frost Giants	1	1481	7997	CHAPTER 1ODDTHERE WAS A BOY called Odd, and there was nothing strange or unusual about that, not in that time or place. Odd meant the tip of a blade, and it was a lucky name.He was odd, though. At least, the other villagers thought so. But if there was one thing that he wasn't, it was lucky.His father had been killed during a sea raid two years before, when Odd was ten. It was not unknown for people to get killed in sea raids, but his father wasn't killed by a Scotsman, dying in glory in the heat of battle as a Viking should. He had jumped overboard to rescue one of the stocky little ponies that they took with them on their raids as pack animals.They would load the ponies up with all the gold and valuables and food and weapons that they could find, and the ponies would trudge back to the longship. The ponies were the most valuable and hardworking things on the ship. After Olaf the Tall was killed by a Scotsman, Odd's father had to look after the ponies. Odd's father wasn't very experienced with ponies, being a woodcutter and wood-carver by trade, but he did his best. On the return journey, one of the ponies got loose during a squall off Orkney and fell overboard. Odd's father jumped into the grey sea with a rope, pulled the pony back to the ship and, with the other Vikings, hauled it back up on deck.He died before the next morning of the cold and the wet and the water in his lungs.When they returned to Norway, they told Odd's mother, and Odd's mother told Odd. Odd just shrugged. He didn't cry. He didn't say anything.Nobody knew what Odd was feeling on the inside. Nobody knew what he thought. And, in a village on the banks of a fjord, where everybody knew everybody's business, that was infuriating.There were no full-time Vikings back then. Everybody had another job. Sea raiding was something the men did for fun or to get things they couldn't find in their village. They even got their wives that way. Odd's mother, who was as dark as Odd's father had been fair, had been brought to the fjord on a longship from Scotland. She would sing Odd the ballads that she had learned as a girl, back before Odd's father had taken her knife away and thrown her over his shoulder and carried her back to the longship.Odd wondered if she missed Scotland, but when he asked her, she said no, not really, she just missed people who spoke her language. She could speak the language of the Norse now, but with an accent.Odd's father had been a master of the axe. He had a one-room cabin that he had built from logs deep in the little forest behind the fjord, and he would go out to the woods and return a week or so later with his handcart piled high with logs, all ready to weather and to split, for they made everything they could out of wood in those parts: wooden nails joined wooden boards to build wooden dwellings or wooden boats. In the winter, when the snows were too deep for travel, Odd's father would sit by the fire and carve, making wood into faces and toys and drinking cups and bowls, while Odd's mother sewed and cooked and, always, sang.She had a beautiful voice.Odd didn't understand the words of the songs she sang, but she would translate them after she had sung them, and his head would roil with fine lords riding out on their great horses, their noble falcons on their wrists, brave hounds always padding by their sides, off to get into all manner of trouble, fighting giants and rescuing maidens and freeing the oppressed from tyranny.After Odd's father died, his mother sang less and less.Odd kept smiling, though, and it drove the villagers mad. He even smiled after the accident that crippled his right leg.Odd's father would sit by the fire and carve, making wood into faces and toys and drinking cups and bowls.It was three weeks after the longship had come back without his father's body. Odd had taken his father's tree-cutting axe, so huge he could hardly lift it, and had hauled it out into the woods, certain that he knew all there was to know about cutting trees and determined to put this knowledge into practice.He should possibly, he admitted to his mother later, have used the smaller axe and a smaller tree to practise on.Still, what he did was remarkable.After the tree had fallen on his foot, he had used the axe to dig away the earth beneath his leg and he had pulled it out, and he had cut a branch to make himself a crutch to lean on, for the bones in his leg were shattered. And, somehow, he had got himself home, hauling his father's heavy axe with him, for metal was rare in those hills and axes needed to be bartered or stolen, and he could not have left it to rust.So two years passed, and Odd's mother married Fat Elfred, who was amiable enough when he had not been drinking, but he already had four sons and three daughters from a previous marriage (his wife had been struck by lightning), and he had no time for a crippled stepson, so Odd spent more and more time out in the great woods.Odd loved the spring, when the waterfalls began to course down the valleys and the woodland was covered with flowers. He liked summer, when the first berries began to ripen, and autumn, when there were nuts and small apples. Odd did not care for the winter, when the villagers spent as much time as they could in the village's great hall, eating root vegetables and salted meat. In winter the men would fight and fart and sing and sleep and wake and fight again, and the women would shake their heads and sew and knit and mend.By March, the worst of the winter would be over. The snow would thaw, the rivers begin to run and the world would wake into itself again.Not that year.Winter hung in there, like an invalid refusing to die. Day after grey day the ice stayed hard; the world remained unfriendly and cold.In the village, people got on one another's nerves. They'd been staring at each other across the great hall for four months now. It was time for the men to make the longship seaworthy, time for the women to start clearing the ground for planting. The games became nasty. The jokes became mean. Fights were to hurt.Which is why, one morning at the end of March-some hours before the sun was up, when the frost was hard and the ground still like iron, while Fat Elfred and his children and Odd's mother were still asleep-Odd put on his thickest, warmest clothes, stole a side of smoke-blackened salmon from where it hung in the rafters of Fat Elfred's house and a firepot with a handful of glowing embers from the fire; and he took his father's second-best axe, which he tied by a leather thong to his belt, and limped out into the woods.The snow was deep and treacherous, with a thick, shiny crust of ice. It would have been hard walking for a man with two good legs, but for a boy with one good leg, one very bad leg and a wooden crutch, every hill was a mountain.Odd crossed a frozen lake, which should have melted weeks before, and went deep into the woods. The days seemed almost as short as they had been in midwinter, and although it was only midafternoon it was dark as night by the time he reached his father's old woodcutting hut.The door was blocked by snow, and Odd had to take a wooden spade and dig it out before he could enter. He fed the firepot with kindling, and tended it until he felt safe transferring the fire into the fireplace, where the old logs were dry.On the floor he found a lump of wood, slightly bigger than his fist. He was going to throw it on the fire, but his fingers felt carving on the small wooden block, and so he put it to one side, to look at when it was light. He gathered snow in a small pan, and melted it over the fire, and he ate smoked fish and hot berry-water.It was good. There were blankets in the corner still, and a straw-stuffed mattress, and he could imagine that the little room smelled of his father, and nobody hit him or called him a cripple or an idiot, and so, after building the fire high enough that it would still be burning in the morning, he went to sleep quite happy.
OFG_ch2	OFG	Odd and the Frost Giants	2	1322	6902	CHAPTER 2THE FOX, THE EAGLE AND THE BEARODD WAS WOKEN BY something scratching against the hut. He pulled himself up to his feet, thought briefly about tales of trolls and monsters, hoped that it wasn't a bear, then opened the door. It was daylight outside, which meant it was late in the morning, and a fox was staring up at him, insolently, from the snow.Its muzzle was narrow, its ears were pricked and sharp and its expression was calculating and sly. When it saw that Odd was watching, it jumped into the air, as if it were trying to show off, and retreated a little way and then stopped. It was red-orange, like flame, and it took a dancing step or two towards Odd, and turned away, then looked back at Odd as if it were inviting him to follow.It was, Odd concluded, an animal with a plan. He had no plans, other than a general determination never to return to the village. And it was not every day that you got to follow a fox.So he did.It moved like a flame, always ahead of him. If Odd slowed down, if the terrain was too difficult, if the boy got tired, then the fox would simply wait patiently at the top of the nearest rise until Odd was ready, and then its tail would go up, and it would flicker forward into the snow.Odd pressed on.There was a bird circling high overhead. A hawk, Odd thought, and then it landed in a dead tree, and he realized how big it was and knew it was an eagle. Its head was cocked oddly to one side, and Odd was convinced it was watching him.He followed the fox up a hill and down another (down was harder than up for Odd, in the snow, with one bad foot and a crutch, and several times he fell) and then halfway up another, to a place where a dead pine tree stuck out from the hill like a rotten tooth. A silver birch tree grew close beside the dead pine. And it was here that the fox stopped.A mournful bellow greeted them.The dead tree had a hole in one side, the kind that bees sometimes inhabit and fill with honeycomb. The people in Odd's village would make the honey into the alcoholic mead they drank to celebrate the safe return of their Vikings, and the midwinter, and any other excuse they needed to celebrate.An enormous brown bear had its front paw caught in the hollow of the pine tree.Odd smiled grimly. It was obvious what had happened.In order to get at the pine tree hollow, the bear had leaned its weight against the birch tree, bending it down and moving it out of the way. But the moment the bear had pushed its paw into the hole, it had taken its weight off the birch, which had snapped back, and now the bear was profoundly trapped.The animal bellowed once more, a deeply grumpy bellow. It looked miserable, but not as if it were about to attack.An enormous brown bear had its front paw caught in the hollow of the pine tree.Warily Odd walked towards the tree.Above them, the eagle circled.Odd unhooked his axe from his belt and walked around the pine tree. He cut a piece of wood about six inches long and used it to prop the two trees apart; he did not want to crush the bear's paw. Then, with clean, economical blows, he swung the blade of his axe against the birch.The wood was hard, but he kept swinging, and he had soon come close to cutting it through.Odd looked at the bear. The bear looked at Odd with big brown eyes. Odd spoke aloud. 'I can't run,' he said to the bear. 'So if you want to eat me, you'll find me easy prey. But I should have worried about that before, shouldn't I? Too late now.'He took a deep breath and swung the axe one last time. The birch tree tipped and fell away from the bear, who blinked and pulled its paw from the hollow in the pine tree. The paw was dripping with honey.The bear licked its paw with a startlingly pink tongue. Odd, who was hungry, picked a lump of honeycomb from the edge of the hole, and ate it, wax and all. The honey oozed down his throat and made him cough.The bear made a snuffling noise. It reached into the tree, pulled out a huge lump of comb and finished it off in a couple of bites. Then it stood up on its hind legs and it roared.Odd wondered if he was going to die now, if the honey had just been an appetizer, but the bear got down on all fours once more and continued, single-mindedly, to empty the tree of honey.It was getting dark.Odd knew it was time for him to head for home. He started down the hill, and was almost at the bottom when he realized that he had absolutely no idea where his hut was. He had followed the fox to get here, but the fox was not going to lead him back. He tried to hurry, and he stumbled on a patch of ice, and his crutch went flying. He landed face-first in the hard snow.He crawled towards his crutch, and as he did so, he felt hot breath on the back of his neck.'Hello, bear,' said Odd, cheerfully. 'You had better eat me. I'll be more use as bear food than I will be frozen to death on the ice.'The bear did not seem to want to eat Odd. It sat down on the ice in front of him, and gestured with its paw.'You mean it?' said Odd. 'You aren't going to eat me?'The bear made a rumbling sort of noise in the back of its throat. But it was a gloomy noise, and not a hungry noise, and Odd decided to chance his luck. The day could not get stranger, after all.He clambered onto the bear's back, holding his crutch with his left hand and clutching the bear's fur with his right. The bear stood up slowly, making sure the boy was on, then set off at a fast lope through the twilight.As the bear sped up, the cold went through Odd's clothes and chilled him to the bone.The fox dashed ahead of them, the eagle flew above them and Odd thought crazily, happily, I'm just like one of the brave lords in my mother's ballads. Only without the horse, the dog and the falcon.And he thought, I can never tell anyone about this, because they won't believe it. Because even I wouldn't believe it.Snow fell from branches as they brushed past and stung his face, but he laughed as they went. The moon rose, pale and huge, and cold, cold, but Odd laughed some more, because his hut was waiting for him, and he was an impossible lord riding a bear, and because he was Odd.The bear stopped in front of Odd's hut, and Odd half climbed, half fell from the beast's back. He pulled himself up with his crutch, and then he said, 'Thank you.' He thought the bear nodded its head in the moonlight, but perhaps he imagined it.There was a crash of wings, and the eagle landed on the snow a few feet from Odd. It tipped its head on one side to stare at Odd with an eye the color of honey. There was nothing but darkness where its other eye should have been.He walked up to his door. The fox was already waiting there, sitting like a dog. The bear padded up to the hut behind him.Odd looked from one animal to the other. 'What?' he said testily, although it was obvious what they wanted.And then, 'I suppose you had better come in,' he said. He opened the door.And they came in.
OFG_ch3	OFG	Odd and the Frost Giants	3	2226	12173	CHAPTER 3THE NIGHT CONVERSATIONODD HAD IMAGINED THAT the side of salmon would feed him for a week or more. But bears and foxes and eagles all, he discovered, eat salmon, and he felt that feeding them was the least he could do to thank them for seeing him home. They ate until it was all gone, but only Odd and the eagle seemed satisfied. The fox and the bear both looked like they were still hungry.'We'll find more food tomorrow,' said Odd. 'Sleep now.'The animals stared at him. He walked over to the straw mattress and climbed onto it, placing the crutch carefully against the wall, to pull himself up with when he woke. The bed didn't smell like his father at all, he realized, as he lay down. It just smelled like straw. Odd closed his eyes, and he was asleep.Dreams of darkness, of flashes, of moments-nothing he could hold on to, nothing that comforted him. And then into the dream came a booming gloomy voice that said, 'It wasn't my fault.'A higher voice, bitterly amused, said, 'Oh, right. I told you not to go pushing that tree down. You just didn't listen.''I was hungry. I could smell the honey. You don't know what it was like, smelling that honey. It was better than mead. Better than roasted goose.' And then, the gloomy voice, so bass it made Odd's stomach vibrate, changed its tone. 'And you, of all people, don't need to go blaming anyone else. It's because of you we're in this mess.''I thought we had a deal. I thought we weren't going to keep harping on about a trivial little mistake...''You call this trivial?'And then a third voice, high and raw, screeched, 'Silence.'There was silence. Odd rolled over. There was a glow from the fire embers, enough to see the inside of the hut, enough to confirm to Odd that there were not another three people in there with him. It was just him and the fox and the bear and the eagle...'It's because of you we're in this mess.'Whatever they are, thought Odd, they don't seem to eat people.He sat up, leaned against the wall. The bear and the eagle both ignored him. The fox darted him a green-eyed glance.'You were talking,' said Odd.The animals looked at Odd and at one another. If they did not actually say 'Who? Us?' it was there in their expressions, in the way they held themselves.'Somebody was talking,' said Odd, 'and it wasn't me. There isn't anyone else in here.That means it was you lot. And there's no point in arguing.''We weren't arguing,' said the bear. 'Because we can't talk.' Then it said, 'Oops.'The fox and the eagle glared at the bear, who put a paw over its eyes and looked ashamed of itself.Odd sighed. 'Which one of you wants to explain what's going on?' he said.'Nothing's going on,' said the fox brightly. 'Just a few talking animals. Nothing to worry about. Happens every day. We'll be out of your hair first thing in the morning.'The eagle fixed Odd with its one good eye. Then it turned to the fox. 'Tell!'The fox shifted uncomfortably. 'Why me?''Oh,' said the bear, 'I don't know. Possibly because it's all your fault?''That's a bit much,' replied the fox. 'Blaming the whole thing on a chap like that. It wasn't like I set out to do this. It could have happened to any of us.''What could?' asked Odd, exasperated. 'And why can you talk?'The bear pushed itself up onto all fours. It made a rumbling noise, then it said, 'We can talk because, O mortal child-do not be afraid-beneath these animal disguises we wear...well, not actual disguises, I mean we are actually a bear and a fox and a big bird, which is a rotten sort of thing to happen, but where was I...?''Gods!' screeched the eagle.'Gods?' said Odd.'Aye. Gods,' said the bear. 'I was just getting to that. I am great Thor, Lord of the Thunders. The eagle is Lord Odin, All-father, greatest of the Gods. And this runt-eared meddling fox is-''Loki,' said the fox smoothly. 'Blood-brother to the Gods. Smartest, sharpest, most brilliant of all the inhabitants of Asgard, or so they say-''Brilliant?' snorted the bear.'You would have fallen for it. Anyone would,' said the fox.'Fallen for what?' said Odd.A flash of green eyes, a sigh and the fox began. 'I'll tell you. And you'll see. It could have happened to anyone. So, Asgard. Home of the mighty. In the middle of a plain, surrounded by an impregnable wall built for us by a Frost Giant. And it was due to me, I should add, that that wall did not cost us the Giant's fee, which was unreasonably high.''Freya,' said the bear. 'The Giant wanted Freya. Most lovely of the Goddesses-with, obviously, the exception of Sif, my own little love. And it wanted the Sun and the Moon.''If you interrupt me one more time,' said the fox, 'one more time, I will not only stop talking, but I shall go off on my own and leave the two of you to fend for yourselves.'The bear said, 'Yes, but-''Not one word.'The bear was silent.The fox said, 'In the great hall of Odin sat all the Gods, drinking mead, eating and telling stories. They drank and bragged and fought and boasted and drank, all through the night and well into the small hours. The women had gone to bed hours since, and now the fires in the hall burned low and most of the Gods slept where they sat, heads resting on the wooden tables. Even great Odin slept in his high chair, his single eye closed in sleep. And yet there was one among the Gods who had drunk and eaten more than any of the others and still was not sleepy. This was I, Loki, called Sky Walker, and I was neither sleepy nor yet drunk, not even a little...'The bear made a noise, a small grumpy harrumph of disbelief. The fox looked at him sharply.'I said one word...''That wasn't a word,' said the bear. 'I just made a noise. So. You weren't drunk.''Right. I wasn't. And not-drunkenly I wandered out from the hall, and I walked, with my shoes that step on air, up to the top of the wall around Asgard, and I looked out over the wall. In the moonlight, standing beneath the wall, staring up at me, I saw the most beautiful woman anyone has ever seen. Her flesh was creamy, her hair was golden, her lips, her shoulders...perfection. And in a voice like the striking of a harp string, she called out to me.''Hail, brave warrior,' she said.'''Hail yourself,' says I. ''Hail, most beautiful of creatures,' at which she laughed prettily and her eyes sparkled and I knew she liked me. ''And what would a young lady of such loveliness be doing, a-wandering alone, and at night, with wolves and trolls and worse on the loose? Let me offer you hospitality-the hospitality of Loki, mightiest and wisest of all the lords of Asgard. I declare that I shall take you into my own house and care for you in every way that I can!''''I cannot accept your offer, O brave and extremely good-looking one,' she said to me, eyes shining like twin sapphires in the moonlight. ''For although you are obviously tall and powerful and extremely attractive, I have promised my father-a king who lives far from here-that I will not give my heart or my lips to any but he who possesses one thing.''''And that one thing is?' says I, determined to bring her anything she named.'''Mjollnir,' says the maiden. ''The Hammer of Thor.''Hah! Pausing only to tell her not to go anywhere, my feet flew, and like the wind I rushed to the great hall. They were all asleep, or so drunk it made no never mind. There was Thor, sleeping in a drunken stupor, his face on the gravy-covered wooden trencher, and hanging from his side, his hammer. Only the nimble fingers of Loki, wiliest and cleverest, could have teased it from the belt without waking Thor-'At this, the bear made a deep noise in the back of its throat. After glaring at it for a moment, the fox said, 'Heavy it was, that hammer. Heavier than people dream. It weighed as much as a small mountain. Too heavy to carry, if you are not Thor. And yet, not too much for my genius. I took off my shoes, which, as I said, can walk on the air, and I tied them, one to the handle and one to the head. Then I snapped my fingers and the hammer followed me.'This time I hurried to the gates of Asgard. I unbarred them and I walked through-followed, I do not need to tell you, by the hammer.'The maiden was there. She was sitting on a boulder and she was weeping.'''Why the tears, O loveliness itself?' I asked.'At that, she looked up at me with a tear-stained face. ''I weep because once I saw you, great and noble lord, I knew I could never love another. And yet I am doomed to give my heart and my caress only to he who lets me touch the Hammer of Thor.''I reached out a hand and touched her cold, wet cheek. ''Dry your tears,' I told her. ''And behold... the Hammer of Thor!''She stopped crying then, and reached out her delicate hands and held the hammer tightly.I had reckoned I could have my fun with the lady and still get the hammer back into the hall before Thor woke up. But we would need to get a move on.'''Now,' I said. ''About that kiss.''For a moment I thought she had begun to cry once again, and then I knew that she was laughing. But the noise she made was not a sweet, tinkling, maidenly laugh. It was a deep, crashing noise, like an ice sheet grinding against a mountainside.'The maiden pulled my shoes from the hammer and dropped them to the ground. She held the hammer as if it was a feather. A wave of cold engulfed me, and I found myself looking up at her, and to make matters worse she wasn't even a she any longer.'She was a man. Well, not a man. Male, yes. Yet big as a high hill, icicles hanging from his beard. And she-he, rather-said, ''After so long, all it took was one drunken, lust-ridden oaf, and Asgard is ours.' Then the Frost Giant peered down at me, and he gestured with the Hammer of Thor. ''And you,' he said in a deep and extremely satisfied voice, ''you need to be something else.''I felt my back pushing up. I felt a tail pushing its way out from the base of my spine. My fingers shrank into paws and claws. It wasn't the first time I had turned into animal form-I was a horse once, you know-but it was the first time it was imposed on me from the outside, and it wasn't a nice feeling. Not a nice feeling at all.''It was worse for us,' said the bear. 'One moment you are fast asleep, dreaming about thunderstorms, and the next you're being scrunched into a bear. They turned the All-father into an eagle.'The eagle screeched, startling Odd. 'Rage!' it said.'The giant laughed at us, waving my hammer around the while, and then he forced Heimdall to summon the Rainbow Bridge and exiled the three of us here to Midgard. There's no more to tell.'There was silence then in the tiny hut. Only the crackle and spit of a pine branch on the fire.'Well,' said Odd, 'Gods or not, I can't keep feeding you, if this winter keeps going. I don't think I can keep feeding me.''We won't die,' said the bear, 'because we can't die here. But we'll get hungry. And we'll get more wild. More animal. It's something that happens when you have taken on animal form.Stay in it too long and you become what you pretend to be. When Loki was a horse-''We don't talk about that,' said the fox.'So is that why the winter isn't ending?' said Odd.'The Frost Giants like the winter. They are the winter,' said the bear.'And if spring never comes? If summer doesn't happen? If this winter just goes on forever?'The bear said nothing. The fox swished its tail impatiently. They looked to the eagle. It tilted its head back, and with one fiery yellow eye it stared at Odd. Then it said, 'Death!''Eventually,' added the fox. 'Not immediately. In a year or so. And some creatures will go south. But most of the people and the animals will die. It's happened before, back when we had wars with the Frost Giants at the dawn of time. When they won, huge ice sheets would cover this part of the world. When we won-and if it took us a hundred thousand years, we always did-the ice sheets would retreat and the spring would return. But we were Gods then, not animals.''And I had my hammer,' said the bear.'Well then,' said Odd. 'We'll set off as soon as it gets light enough to travel.''Set off?' said the fox. 'For where?''Asgard, of course,' said Odd, and he smiled his infuriating smile. Then he went back to his little bed, and he went back to sleep.
OFG_ch4	OFG	Odd and the Frost Giants	4	1832	10015	CHAPTER 4MAKING RAINBOWS'WHAT'S THAT YOU'VE GOT there?' asked the fox.'It's a lump of wood,' said Odd. 'My father began to carve it into something years ago, and he left it here, but he never came back to finish it.''What was it going to be?''I don't know,' admitted Odd. 'My father used to say that the carving was in the wood already. You just had to find out what the wood wanted to be, and then take your knife and remove everything that wasn't that.''Mm.' The fox seemed unimpressed.Odd was riding on the bear's back. The fox trotted along beside them. High above them, the eagle rode the winds. The sun shone in a cloudless blue sky, and it was colder than it had been when there was cloud cover. They were heading towards higher ground, along a rocky ridge, following a frozen river. The wind hurt Odd's face and ears.'This won't work,' said the bear gloomily. 'I mean, whatever it is, it won't.'Odd said nothing.'You're smiling, aren't you,' said the bear. 'I can tell.'The thing was this: You got to Asgard, the place the Gods came from, by crossing the Rainbow Bridge, which was called Bifrost. If you were a God, you simply wiggled your fingers and a rainbow appeared, and you walked across it.High above them, the eagle rode the winds.Easy, or so the fox said, and the bear morosely agreed. Or at least, it was easy until you didn't have fingers. Which they didn't. Still, even if you didn't have fingers, Loki pointed out, you could normally still find a rainbow and use it. Rainbows turned up after it rained, didn't they?Well, they didn't in midwinter.Odd thought about it. He thought about the way rainbows appeared on rainy days, when the sun came out.'I think,' said the bear, 'as a responsible adult, I should point a few things out.''Talk is free,' said Odd, 'but the wise man chooses when to spend his words.' It was something his father used to say.'I just thought I should point out that we are wasting our time. We don't have any way of getting to the Rainbow Bridge. And if by some miracle we crossed it, look at us-we're animals, and you can barely walk. We can't defeat Frost Giants. This whole thing is hopeless.''He's right,' said the fox.'If it's hopeless,' said Odd, 'why are you coming with me?'The animals said nothing. The morning sun sparkled up at them from the snow, dazzling Odd, making him squint.'Nothing better to do,' said the bear after a while.'Up here!' said Odd. He clung tightly to the bear's fur as they clambered up the side of a steep hill. They could see the mountains beyond.'Stop,' said Odd. The waterfall was one of his favorite places in the world. From spring until midwinter it ran high and fast before it crashed down almost a hundred feet into the valley beneath, where it had carved out a rocky basin. In high summer, when the sun barely set, the villagers would come out to the waterfall and splash around in the basin pool, letting the water tumble onto their heads.Now, the waterfall was frozen and ice ran from the crags down to the basin in twisted ropes and great clear icicles.'It's a waterfall,' said Odd. 'We used to come out here. And when the water came down and the sun was shining brightly, you could see a rainbow, like a huge circle, all around the waterfall.''No water,' said the fox. 'No water, no rainbow.''There's water,' said Odd. 'But it's ice.'He took the axe from his belt, pushed his crutch beneath his arm as he got down from the bear's back and walked over the ice until he stood before the frozen waterfall. He used the crutch to hold himself in position as best he could. Then he began to swing the axe. The noise of the blade hitting the thick icicle cracked off the hills around them, making echoes that sounded as if an entire army of men was hammering on the ice...There was a crash, and an icicle as large as Odd smashed down to the surface of the frozen pool.'Clever,' said the bear, in the kind of tone of voice that meant that it wasn't clever at all.'You broke it.''Yes,' said Odd. He inspected the shards of ice on the ground, picked up the biggest, most cleanly broken piece he could find, then took it to the side of the frozen pool, and put it on a rock, and stared at it.'It's a lump of ice,' said the fox. 'If you ask me.''Yes,' said Odd. 'I think the rainbows are imprisoned in the ice when the water freezes.'The boy took out his knife and began to trace outlines on the ice block with the blade, going back and forth with it, scoring it as best he could.The eagle circled high above them, almost invisible in the midwinter sun.'He's been up there a long time,' said the bear. 'Do you think he's looking for something?'The fox said, 'I worry about him. It must be hard to be an eagle. He could get lost in there.When I was a horse...''A mare, you mean,' said the bear with a grunt.The fox tossed its head and walked away. Odd put his knife down and took out his axe once more. 'I've seen rainbows on the snow sometimes,' said Odd, loud enough for the fox to hear, 'and on the side of buildings, when the sun shone through the icicles. And I thought, Ice is only water, so it must have rainbows in it too. When the water freezes, the rainbows are trapped in it, like fish in a shallow pool. And the sunlight sets them free.'Odd knelt on the frozen pond. He hit the big lump of ice with his axe. This did nothing-the axe just glanced off the ice and nearly cut into his leg.'Do that again and you'll break the axe,' said the fox. 'Hold on.'He nosed along the bank of the frozen pool for several minutes. Then he began scrabbling at the snow. 'Here,' he said. 'This is what you need.' He put his paw on a grey rock he had revealed.Odd pulled at the stone, which came up easily from the ground, and it proved to be a flint.Part of it was grey, but the other part, the translucent part of the flint, was a deep salmon-pink color, and it seemed to have been chipped.'Don't touch the edges,' said the fox. 'It'll be sharp. Really sharp. They didn't mess about when they made those things, and they don't blunt easily if you make them well.''What is it?''A hand axe. They used to do sacrifices here, on that big rock over there, and they used tools like this to slice up the animal and to part the flesh from the bones.''How do you know?' asked Odd.There was satisfaction and pride in the fox's voice as it said, 'Who do you think they were making sacrifices to?'Odd brought the tool over to the lump of ice. He ran his hands over the ice, slippery as a fish, then he began to attack the ice with the flint. The rock felt warm in his hands. Hot, even.'It's hot,' said Odd.'Is it?' said the fox, sounding pleased with itself.The ice fell away under the flint axe, just as Odd had wanted it to. He hacked it into a shape that was almost triangular, thicker on one side than on the other.The fox and the bear stood nearby watching. The eagle descended to see what was going on, landed in the leafless branches of a tree and was still as a statue.Odd took his ice triangle and placed it so that the sunlight shone through it onto the white snow that drifted on the frozen pool. Nothing happened. He twisted it, tilted it, moved it around and...A puddle of light appeared on the snow, all the colors of the rainbow...'How is that?' asked Odd.'But it's on the ground,' said the bear doubtfully. 'It should be in the air. I mean, how can that be a bridge?'The eagle took off from the tree with a clap of wings, and began to fly upwards.'I don't think he's very impressed,' said the fox. 'Nice try.'Odd shrugged. He could feel his mouth pulling up into a smile even as his heart sank. He had been so proud of himself, making a rainbow. His hands were numb. He hefted the stone axe, was about to throw it, hard, away from him and then simply dropped it.A screech. Odd looked up to see the eagle plummeting towards them. He began to step back, marvelling at the eagle's speed, wondering how the bird could pull out in time...It didn't pull out.The eagle hit the patch of colored light on the white snow without slowing, as if it was diving into a pool of liquid water.The puddle of color splashed...and opened.Scarlet fell softly about them and everything was outlined in greens and blues and the world was raspberry-colored and leaf-colored and golden-colored and fire-colored and blueberry-colored and wine-colored. Odd's world was colors, and, despite his crutch, he could feel himself falling forward, tumbling into the rainbow...Everything went dark. Odd's eyes took moments to adjust, and when they did, above him was a velvet night sky, hung with a billion stars. A rainbow arced across it, and Odd was walking on the rainbow-no, not walking: his feet did not move. It felt as if he was being carried up the arch, going upwards, forwards, uncertain how fast he was travelling, only certain that he was somehow swept up in the colors and that it was the colors of the rainbow that were carrying him along.He looked behind him, wondering if he would see the snowy world he had left, but he saw nothing but blackness, empty even of stars.Odd's stomach gave a sort of a lurch. He could feel himself dropping, and he turned his head to see the rainbow fading. Through the prism of colors he saw huge fir trees, foggy and purple and blue and red, and then the trees came into focus and found their own color-a cool bluish green-as Odd tumbled off the side of a fir tree and down into a drift of snow. The scent of bruised fir tree surrounded him.It was daylight. He was wet, and cold, but unhurt.He glanced up, but there was no sign of the Rainbow Bridge. Silently, across the thick snow, the fox and the bear were walking towards him. And then, with a rattle and a clatter, the eagle landed on a branch beside him, making the snow on the branch fall flump to the ground.The eagle looked less crazy now, thought Odd. And then, it looks bigger.'Where is this place?' asked Odd, but he knew the answer, knew it even before the eagle threw back its head and screamed, with delight and with relish and with keen, dark joy,'Asgard!'
OFG_ch5	OFG	Odd and the Frost Giants	5	1810	10024	CHAPTER 5AT MIMIR'S WELLREALLY, TRULY, WITH ALL of his heart, Odd found that he wanted to believe that he was still in the world he had known all his life. That he was still in the country of the Norse folk, that he was in Midgard. Only he wasn't, and he knew it. The world smelled different, for a start. It smelled alive. Everything he looked at looked sharper, more real, more there.And if there was any doubt, then he only had to look at the animals.'You got bigger,' he told them. 'You've grown.'And they had. The fox's ears were now level with Odd's chest. The eagle's wingspan, when the bird preened in the sunshine, was as wide as a longship. The bear, which had not been small to begin with, was now the size of Odd's father's hut, enormous in its bulk and in its bearishness.'We didn't grow,' said the fox, its fur the vivid orange color of a blazing fire. 'This is how big we are here. We're normal-sized.'Odd nodded. Then he said, 'So this whole place is called Asgard, and the town we have to go to is also called Asgard, yes?''We named it after ourselves,' said the bear. 'After the Aesir.''How far is it to your place?'The fox sniffed the air, then it looked around. There were mountains behind them, and a forest all about them. 'A day's travel. Maybe a little more. Once we get through this forest we reach the plain, and the town is in the center of the plain.'Odd nodded. 'I suppose we should get on with it, then.''There will be time,' said the bear. 'Asgard is not going anywhere. And right now, I am hungry. I am going fishing. Why don't you two build us a fire?' And without waiting to see what would happen, the great beast lumbered off into the darkness of the forest. The eagle flapped its wings, loud as a small thunderclap, and it took off, circling higher and higher, and then followed the bear.Odd and the fox gathered wood, finding dry twigs and dead branches, then Odd heaped them high. He took out his knife and sliced a point on a hard stick, put the point against a piece of dry, soft wood, preparing to rotate the stick between his hands, to use the friction to make a fire.The fox eyed him, unimpressed. 'Why bother?' it said. 'This is easier.' It put its muzzle against the heap of wood, breathed on the twigs. The air above the twigs wavered and shimmered, then, with a crackle, the sticks caught fire.'How did you do that?''This is Asgard,' said the fox. 'It's less...solid...than the place you come from. The Gods-even transformed Gods-well, there is power in this place...you understand?''Not really. But not to worry.'Odd sat beside the fire and he waited for the bear and the eagle to return. While he waited, he took out the piece of wood his father had started to carve. He inspected it, puzzling over the shape, familiar yet strange, wondering what it had been intended to be, and why it should bother him so. He ran his thumb over it, and it comforted him.It was twilight by the time the bear brought back the largest trout Odd had ever seen. The boy gutted it with his knife (the fox devoured the raw guts enthusiastically), then he speared it through with a long stick, cut two forked sticks to make an improvised spit and he roasted it over the fire, turning it every few minutes to ensure it did not burn.When the fish was cooked, the eagle took the head, and the other three divided the meat between them, the bear eating more than the other two put together.The twilight edged imperceptibly into night, and a huge, dark-yellow moon began to rise on the horizon, achingly slowly.When they had finished eating, the fox went to sleep beside the fire, and the eagle flapped heavily off into a dead pine to sleep. Odd took the leftover fish and pushed it into a drift of snow, to keep it fresh, as his mother had taught him.The bear looked at Odd. Then it said casually, 'You must be thirsty. Come on. Let's look for some water.'Odd climbed onto the bear's broad back, and held tight as it lumbered off into the darkness of the forest.It didn't feel like they were looking for anything, though. It felt like the bear knew exactly where he was going, that he was heading somewhere. Up a ridge and down into a small gorge and through a copse of trees, magical in its stillness, and then they were pushing through scratchy gorse, and now they were in a small clearing, in the center of which was a pool of liquid water.'Careful,' said the bear, quietly. 'It goes down a long way.'Odd stared. The yellow moonlight was deceptive, but still...'There are shapes moving in the water,' he said.'Nothing in there that will hurt you,' said the bear. 'They're just reflections, really. It's safe to drink. I give you my word.'Odd untied his wooden cup from his belt. He dipped it into the water, and he drank. The water was refreshing and strangely sweet. He had not realized how thirsty he had been, and he filled and emptied his wooden cup four times.And then he yawned. 'Feel so sleepy.''It's all the travelling,' said the bear. 'Here. Let me.' It pulled over several fallen fir branches at the edge of the clearing with its teeth. 'Curl up on these.''But the others...' said Odd.'I'll tell them you fell asleep in the woods,' said the bear. 'Just don't go wandering off.For now, just rest.'And the bear lay down on the branches, crushing them under its bulk. The boy lay beside the animal, smelling the deep bearish scent of it, pushing against the fur and feeling the softness and the warmth.The world was comfortable and quiet and warm. He was safe, and everything was enclosed by the dark...When he opened his eyes once more, he was cold, and he was alone, and the moon was huge and white and high in the sky. More than twice as big as the moon in Midgard, thought Odd, and he wondered if that was because Asgard was closer to the moon, or whether it had its own moon...The bear was gone.In the pale moonlight Odd could see shapes moving in the water of the pool, and he pulled himself to his feet and limped over to look more closely.At the water's edge he crouched down, made a cup from his hand, scooped up water, and drank. The water was icy cold, but as he drank he felt warmed and safe and comfortable.The figures in the water dissolved and reformed.'What do you need to see?' asked a voice from behind Odd.Odd said nothing.'You have drunk from my spring,' said the voice.'Did I do something wrong?' asked Odd.There was silence. Then, 'No,' said the voice. It sounded very old, so ancient Odd could not tell if it was a man's voice or a woman's. Then the voice said, 'Look.'On the water's surface he saw reflections. His father, in the winter, playing with him and his mother-a silly game of blindman's buff that left them all giggling and helpless on the ground...He saw a huge creature, with icicles in its beard and hair like the pattern the frost makes on the leaves and on the ice early in the morning, sitting beside a huge wall, scanning the horizon restlessly.He saw his mother sitting in a corner of the great hall, sewing up Fat Elfred's worn jerkin, and her eyes were red with tears.He saw the cold plains where the Frost Giants live, saw Frost Giants hauling rocks, and feasting on great horned elk, and dancing beneath the moon.He saw his father, sitting in the woodcutter's hut he had so recently left himself. His father had a knife in one hand, a lump of wood in the other. He began to carve, a strange, distant smile on his face. Odd knew that smile...He saw his father as a young man, leaping from the longship into the sea and running up a craggy beach. Odd knew that this was Scotland, that soon his father would meet his mother...He saw his mother sitting in a corner of the great hall...and her eyes were red with tears.He kept watching.The moonlight was so bright in that place. Odd could see what he needed to. After some time, he pulled out the lump of wood he had found in his father's hut and his knife, and he began to carve, in smooth, confident strokes, removing everything that wasn't part of the carving.He carved until daybreak, when the bear crunched through the trees into the clearing.It did not ask what Odd had seen in the pool, and Odd did not volunteer anything.Odd climbed onto the bear's back. 'You're getting smaller again,' said Odd. This was no longer the huge bear of the previous evening. Now it seemed only slightly bigger than it had been the first time Odd had ridden it. 'You've shrunk.''If you say so,' said the bear.'Where do the Frost Giants come from?' asked Odd, as they bounded through the forest.'Jotunheim,' said the bear. 'It means giants' home. It's across the great river. Mostly they stay on their own side. But they've crossed before. One time, one of them wanted the Sun, the Moon and Lady Freya. The time before that, they wanted my hammer, Mjollnir, and the hand of Lady Freya. There was one time they wanted all the treasures of Asgard and Lady Freya...''They must like Lady Freya a lot,' said Odd.'They do. She's very pretty.''What's it like in Jotunheim?' asked Odd.'Bleak. Treeless. Cold. Desolate. Nothing like it is here. You should ask Loki.''Why?''He wasn't always one of the Aesir. He was born a Frost Giant. He was the smallest Frost Giant ever. They used to laugh at him. So he left. Saved Odin's life, on his travels. And he...'The bear hesitated and seemed to think twice about whatever he had been going to say, then finished, '...he keeps things interesting.' And then the bear said, 'Anything that you did last night, anything you saw...''Yes?''The wise man knows when to keep silent. Only the fool tells all he knows.'The fox and the eagle were waiting beside the remains of the fire. Odd finished what was left of the fish. Then the bear said, 'Well? What do we do now?'Odd said, 'Take me to the edge of the forest. You wait for me. I'll walk alone from there to the gates of Asgard.''Why?' asked the fox.'Because I don't want the Frost Giants knowing you three are back,' said Odd. 'Not yet.'They set off.'I could get very used to travelling by bear,' Odd said. But the bear only grunted.
OFG_ch6	OFG	Odd and the Frost Giants	6	2577	13979	CHAPTER 6THE GATES OF ASGARDWHERE THE FOREST ENDED, the bear stopped, and Odd climbed off. He put his crutch beneath his armpit, gripped it hard with his right hand.'Right,' he said. 'Wish me good luck. The blessing of the Gods must count for something.''What if you don't come back?' said the fox.'Then you're no worse off now than you were before you met me,' said Odd cheerfully.'Anyway, why shouldn't I come back?''They could eat you,' said the bear.Odd blinked. 'Ah...do Frost Giants eat people?'There was a pause. The fox said, 'Occasionally' at the same time as the bear said,'Almost never.'The fox coughed. 'I wouldn't worry,' it said. 'There's barely any meat on you. You'd scarcely be worth the trouble of eating.' It grinned. This did nothing to make Odd feel any better.He hefted his crutch and began to walk, slowly, laboriously, towards the huge stone wall that surrounded the city of the Gods.The snow had blown clear of the path, and although the ground was slippery in places, he found the walk was not as hard as he had expected.Days were longer here in Asgard. The sun was a silver coin that hung in the white sky.Odd pushed himself to keep walking, one step at a time, remembering back when he had walked with ease and never thought twice about the miracle of putting one foot in front of the other and pushing the world towards you.At first, Odd thought that the wall of Asgard was as high as a tall man and that there was a pale statue of a man sitting on a boulder beside it-at least, he imagined it to be a statue. And then he moved slowly closer, and closer, and the wall grew, and the pale statue grew also, until, as the boy got closer still, he had to throw back his head to look at them.Every step he took towards the gates, towards the huge pale figure on the boulder, he felt the temperature drop.And then the statue moved, and Odd knew.'WHO ARE YOU?' The voice tumbled across the plain like an avalanche.'I'm called Odd,' shouted Odd, and he smiled.The Frost Giant peered down at him. There were icicles in its eyebrows, and its eyes were the color of lake ice just before it cracks and drops you into freezing water.'WHAT ARE YOU? A GOD? A TROLL? SOME KIND OF WALKING CORPSE?''I'm a boy,' yelled Odd, and he smiled again.'AND WHAT IN YMIR'S NAME ARE YOU DOING HERE?'It is a strange sensation, talking to a being who could crush you like a man could crush a baby mouse. And, thought Odd, at least mice can run.'I'm here to drive the Frost Giants from Asgard,' explained Odd. Then he smiled at the giant, a big, happy, irritating smile.It was the smile that did it. If Odd had not smiled, the giant would simply have picked him up and crushed the life from him, or squashed him against the boulder, or bitten his head off and kept him to snack on later. But that smile, a smile that said that Odd knew more than he was saying...'No, you won't,' said the Frost Giant. 'You can't.'''Fraid so,' said Odd.'I outwitted Loki,' said the Frost Giant portentously. 'I bested Thor. I banished Odin. All of Asgard is pacified and under my rule. Even now, my brothers march from Jotunheim, as reinforcements.' He darted a look towards the horizon, to the north. 'The Gods are my slaves. I am betrothed to the lovely Freya. And you honestly think you can go up against me?'Odd just shrugged and continued to smile. It was his broadest, most irritating smile, and at home, it had always gotten him hit. Even the giant wanted to hurt him, to wipe that smile off his face. But nobody had smiled at the giant like that before, and it bothered him.'I rule Asgard!' boomed the giant.'Why?' asked Odd.'WHY?''I can hear you fine without you shouting,' said Odd, when the reverberations had died away. And then he said, pitching his voice just a little quieter, so the giant had to lean in to listen,'Why do you want to rule Asgard? Why did you take it over?'The frost giant raised himself from the huge boulder. Then he jerked a thumb behind him.'See that wall?' he said.You couldn't avoid seeing it. It filled the world. Every stone in the wall was bigger than the houses in Odd's village.'My brother built that wall. He made a deal with the Gods-to build them a wall inside six months, or he would take no payment. And on the last day, as he was just about to complete it...on the last hour of the last day, they cheated him.''How?''A mare, the most beautiful animal anyone had ever seen, ran across the plain and lured away the stallion who was hauling the stones for my brother. It used womanish wiles. The stallion broke its bonds, and the horses ran off into the woods together and were gone. And then, just when my poor brother had nerved himself up to complain about how he was being treated, Thor returned from his travels and killed him with his damnable hammer. That's how every tale of the Gods and the Frost Giants ends-with Thor killing Giants. Well, not this time.''Obviously not,' said Odd, who was beginning to have his suspicions about who the mare had been. 'So, what did your brother want for payment?''Nothing really,' said the giant, shifting from foot to foot. 'Just stuff.'He sat down again on the boulder. Where the air touched the Frost Giant, it seemed to steam. Odd had seen the water in the fjord steam in winter, when the air was colder than the water. He wondered how cold the Frost Giant was.'He wanted the Sun,' said the giant, 'the Moon. And Freya. All things that I now control, for Asgard is mine!''Yes. You said that.'There was a pause. The Frost Giant looked tired, Odd thought. Then Odd said, again,'Why? Why did he want those things?'The Frost Giant took a deep breath. 'HOW DARE YOU QUESTION ME!' he roared, and Odd felt the earth shake beneath him. He leaned on his crutch to keep his balance as icy winds blew past him. Odd didn't say anything. He just smiled some more.The giant said, 'Would you mind if I picked you up? It would make it easier to talk if we were face-to-face.''So long as you're careful,' said Odd.The giant reached down and laid his hand flat on the ground, palm up, and Odd clambered awkwardly onto it. Then the giant cupped his hand and lifted Odd up, so the boy was on a level with his mouth, and the giant whispered, in a voice like the howl of a winter wind, 'Beauty.''Beauty?''The three most beautiful things there are. The Sun, the Moon and Freya the lovely. It's not beautiful, really, in Jotunheim. There's just rocks and crags and...Well, they can be beautiful too, if you take them the right way. And we can see the Sun there, and the Moon. No Freya-nothing that beautiful. She's beautiful. But she does have a tongue on her.''So you came here for beauty?''Beauty, and revenge for my brother. I told the other Frost Giants I'd do it, and they all laughed at me. But they aren't laughing now, are they?'Then the giant cupped his hand and lifted Odd up, so the boy was on a level with his mouth.'What about spring?''Spring?''Spring. In Midgard. Where I come from. It isn't happening this year. And if the winter continues, then everyone will die. People. Animals. Plants.'Frosty blue eyes bigger than windows stared at Odd. 'Why should I care about that?' The Frost Giant put Odd down on the top of the wall around Asgard, the wall his brother had built. It was windy up there, and Odd leaned into his crutch, scared that a gust of wind would blow him away and down to his death. He glanced behind him, and was not surprised to see that the home of the Gods looked almost exactly like the village on the fjord from which he had come. Bigger, of course, but of the same pattern-a feasting hall and smaller buildings all around it.Odd said, 'You should care because you care about beauty. And there won't be any. There will just be dead things.''Dead things can be beautiful,' said the Frost Giant. 'Anyway, I won it. I beat them. I fooled them and I tricked them. I banished Thor and Odin and that miniature turncoat Loki.' And then he sighed.Odd remembered what he had seen in the pool, the previous night. He said, 'Do you really think your brothers are on the way?''Ah,' said the Frost Giant. 'Um. They may be. I mean, they all said they would...if I did...It's just that I don't think that any of them actually expected me to conquer this place, and they all have things to do, farms and houses and children and wives. I don't think that they really want to come down to the hot lands and play soldiers guarding a bunch of grumpy Gods.''And I suppose they can't all be betrothed to lovely Freya.''Lucky them,' said the Frost Giant, darkly. 'She's beautiful. Oh yes. She's beautiful. I'll give you that.' He shook his head. Icicles fell from his hair and crashed, tinkling, on the rocks beneath. 'She's got a carriage pulled by cats, you know. I tried stroking them.' He held up the index finger of his right hand. It was covered in scratches and cuts. 'She said it was my own fault. That I'd got them overexcited.'She is beautiful,' he said, and sighed. 'But she only comes up to the top of my foot. She shouts louder than a giantess when she's angry. And she's always angry.''But you can't go home when you've won,' said Odd.'Exactly. You wait here, in this hot, horrible place, for reinforcements who don't want to come, while the locals hate you...''So go home,' said Odd. 'Tell them that I beat you.' He wasn't smiling now.The Frost Giant looked at Odd, and Odd looked at the Frost Giant.The Frost Giant said, 'You're too small to fight. You would have to have outwitted me.'Odd nodded. 'My mother used to tell me stories about boys who tricked giants. In one of them, they had a stone-throwing contest, but the boy had a bird, not a stone, and it went up into the air and just kept going.''I'd never fall for that one,' said the giant. 'Anyway, birds, they just head for the nearest tree.''I am trying,' said Odd, 'to allow you to go home with your honor intact and a whole skin. You aren't making it any easier for me.'The giant said, 'A whole skin?''You banished Thor to Midgard,' said Odd, 'yet he's back now. It's only a matter of time until he gets here.'The giant blinked. 'But I have his hammer,' he said. 'I turned it into this boulder I sit on.''Go home.''But if I take Freya back to Jotunheim, she'll just shout at me and make everything worse.And if I take Thor's hammer, he'll just come after it, and one day he'll get it, and then he'll kill me.'Odd nodded in agreement. It was true. He knew it was.When, in the years that followed, the Gods told this tale, late at night, in their great hall, they always hesitated at this point, because in a moment Odd will reach into his jerkin and pull out something carved of wood, and none of them, try how they might, was certain what it was.Some of the Gods claimed that it was a wooden key, and some said it was a heart. There was a school of thought that maintained that what Odd had presented the giant with was a realistic carving of Thor's hammer, and that the giant had been unable to tell the real from the false, and had fled, in terror.It was none of these things.Before he took it out, Odd said, 'My father met my mother when our village was raiding somewhere in Scotland. That's far to the south of us. He discovered her trying to hide her father's sheep in a cave, and she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. So he brought her, and the sheep, home. He would not even touch her until he had taught her enough of the way we speak to be able to tell her he wanted her for his wife. But he said that on the voyage home, she was so beautiful she lit up the world. And she did. She lit up his world, like the summer sun.''This was before you were born,' said the Frost Giant.'True,' said Odd, 'but I saw it.''How?'Odd knew, without being told, that it would be very, very wrong to mention the pool in the forest to the Frost Giant, let alone the shapes that he had seen moving in the pool the night before. He lied, but it was the truth also. He said, 'I saw it in my father's eyes. He loved her, and a few years ago he started to make something for her, but he left it unfinished, and then he didn't come back to finish it. So last night, I finished it for him. At first I didn't know how it was meant to look, and then I saw her...I mean, it's as I imagine her, my mother, when they had just met.Stolen from her people and her land, but brave and determined, and not ever going to give in to fear or grief or loneliness.'The giant said nothing.Odd said, 'You came here for beauty, didn't you? And you can't go back empty-handed.'He reached into his jerkin and he took out the thing that he had carved. His father's carving, which he had finished. It was his mother, as she had looked before he was born. It was the finest thing that Odd had ever made, and it was beautiful.The Frost Giant squinted at it, and then, just for a moment, smiled. He put the carved head into his pouch, and he said, 'It is...remarkable. And lovely. Yes. I will take it back with me to Jotunheim, and it will brighten my hall.' The Frost Giant hesitated, then he said, a little wistfully, 'Do you think I should say good-bye to Lady Freya?'Odd said, 'If you do, she'll probably shout at you some more.''Or beg me to take her with me,' said the Frost Giant. Odd could have sworn that the Frost Giant shivered at that.The Frost Giant took a step away from Odd, and as he moved away, he grew. He went from being the size of a high hill to being the size of a mountain. Then he reached an arm up into the grey of the winter sky. His hand vanished in the cloud...'I think I need good weather to leave in,' said the giant. 'Something to hide my tracks and to make me hard to follow.'Odd could not see quite what the Frost Giant did, but when he lowered his hand, snow began to fall in huge white flakes that spun and tumbled and obscured the world. The giant began to lumber away into the blizzard.'Hey!' called Odd. 'I don't know your name!'But the figure did not hear him, or if it did, it did not answer, and in moments it was lost to sight.
OFG_ch7	OFG	Odd and the Frost Giants	7	1940	10605	CHAPTER 7FOUR TRANSFORMATIONS AND A MEALTHE EAGLE FOUND HIM, as he sat on the wall, in an area that he had kept as free of snow as he could. The great bird landed beside the boy.'Good?' it said. It was twilight, and the snow was falling more gently now.'I'm cold,' said Odd. 'I nearly got blown off there a couple of times. I was getting worried I'd have to spend the rest of my life up on this wall. But, yes, I'm good.'The great bird landed beside the boy.The eagle simply looked at him.'The Frost Giant's gone,' said Odd. 'I made him go away.''How?' asked the eagle.'Magic,' said Odd, and he smiled, and thought, If magic means letting things do what they wanted to do, or be what they wanted to be...'Down,' said the eagle.Odd eyed the snowy rocks that made the wall. 'I can't climb down that,' he said. 'I'll die.'The eagle launched itself from the edge of the wall, circled downward. It soon returned, flapping heavily, carrying a worn-looking soft leather shoe, which it dropped on the wall beside Odd. Off again it went, into the snowy dusk, and came back with a shoe that was a twin to the first.'They're too big for me,' said Odd.'Loki's,' said the eagle.'Oh,' said Odd, remembering the shoes from Loki's story, the ones that walked in the sky.He pulled them on. Then, warily, heart pounding, Odd limped to the edge of the wall, and when he got to the edge, he stopped.He tried to jump, and nothing happened. He didn't move a muscle.Oh come on, he told his feet, his good one and the one that was broken and twisted, the one that hurt all the time. You've got magical flying shoes on. Just walk out into the air, and you'll be fine.But his feet and his legs ignored him, and he stood where he was. He turned to the eagle, who was wheeling above Odd's head impatiently. 'I can't do it,' he said. 'I've tried and I can't.'The eagle gave a screech, flapped its wings hard, and rose into the snowy air.Another screech. Odd looked around. The eagle was heading straight for him, wings outstretched, hooked beak open wide, talons out, single eye aflame...Odd took an involuntary step backwards, and the eagle's claws missed him by less than the width of a feather...'What was that for?' he shouted after the bird.Then he looked down and saw the ground that wasn't under his feet. He was a very long way up, standing unsupported on the air.'Oh,' said Odd. Then he smiled, and he slid down the sky like a boy going down a hill, shouting as he did so something that sounded remarkably like 'Whee!' and he landed as lightly as a snowflake.Odd pushed himself back up into the air and began to jump, ten, twenty, thirty feet at a time...He moved towards the cluster of wooden buildings that were Asgard, and did not stop until he heard the sound of cats, mewing and mrowling...The Goddess Freya was nowhere near as scary as Odd had imagined from the Frost Giant's description. True, she was beautiful, and her hair was golden, and her eyes were the blue of the summer sky, but it was her smile that Odd warmed to-amused, and gentle, and forgiving. It was safe, that smile, and he told her everything, or almost.When she understood who the three animals really were, her smile became wider.'Well, well, well,' she said. And then she said, 'Boys!' They were in the great mead hall now. It was empty and no fire burned in the hearth. The Goddess reached out her right arm.The eagle, which had been sitting on the ornately carved back of the highest chair, flapped over and landed awkwardly on her wrist. Its talons gripped her pale flesh so hard that crimson beads of blood welled up, yet she did not appear to notice this, or to be in any visible discomfort.She scratched the back of the bird's neck with her fingernail, and it preened against her.'Odin All-father,' she said. 'Wisest of the Aesir. One-eyed Battle God. You who drank the water of wisdom from Mimir's Well...return to us.' And then, with her left hand, she began to reshape the bird, to push at it, to change it...A tall, grey-bearded man, with a cruel, wise face stood before them. He was naked, something he seemed scarcely to notice. He walked over to the tall chair, picked up a large grey cloak, and an ancient floppy-brimmed hat-which Odd could have sworn had not been there the last time he looked-and he put them on.'I was far away,' he told Freya absently. 'And getting farther away with every moment that passed. Good job.'But Freya had already put her attention on the bear, and was kneading at it with both hands, pushing and shaping, like a mother bear licking her cubs into shape. Beneath her fair hands the bear changed. He was red-bearded and covered in hair, and his upper arms looked as knotted and as powerful as ancient trees. He was the biggest man, who was not a giant, that Odd had ever seen. He looked friendly, and he winked at Odd, which made the boy feel strangely proud.Odin tossed Thor a tunic, and he walked into the shadows to get dressed. Then he paused, and turned back.'I need my hammer,' Thor said. 'I need Mjollnir.''I know where it is,' said Odd. 'It was hidden as a boulder. I can show you, if you like.''When we've finished the important business at hand, perhaps?' said the fox. 'Me next.'Freya looked at the animal, amused. 'You know,' she said, 'many people will find you much easier to cope with in that shape. Are you sure you don't want me to leave you?'The fox growled, then the growl became a choked cough, and the fox said, 'Fair Freya, you joke with me. But do not the bards sing:'''A woman both fair and just and compassionate'''Only she can be compared to glorious Freya'?''Loki, you caused all this,' she said. 'All of it.''Yes,' he said. 'I admit it. But I found the boy as well. You can't just focus on the bad stuff.''One day,' said Freya softly, 'I will regret this.' But she smiled to herself, and she reached a hand out and touched the black tip of the fox's muzzle, then ran her finger up between its ears and along its spine and all the way up to the very tip of its tail.A shimmer-then a man stood in front of them, beardless, flame-haired, as pale of skin as Freya herself. Eyes like green chips of ice. Odd wondered if Loki had a fox's eyes still, or if the fox had always had Loki's eyes.Thor threw Loki some clothes. 'Cover yourself,' he said bluntly.Now Freya turned her attention to Odd. Her gentle smile filled his world. 'Your turn,' she said.'I look like this anyway,' said Odd.'I know,' said Freya. She knelt down beside him, reached out a hand towards his injured leg. 'May I?''Um. If you want to.'She picked him up as if he was light as a leaf, and put him down on the great feasting table of the Gods. She reached down to his right foot and deftly unhooked it at the knee. She ran a nail across the shin and the flesh parted. Freya looked at the bone, and her face fell. 'It was crushed,'she said, 'so much that not even I can repair it.' And then she said, 'But I can help.'She pushed her hand into the inside of Odd's leg, kneading the smashed bones, pulling together the fragments from inside the leg, smoothing them together. Then she opened the flesh of the foot and repeated the same operation, putting the pieces of foot bone and toe bone back where they were meant to be. And then she encased the skeletal leg and foot in flesh once more, sealed it up, and the Goddess Freya reattached Odd's leg to Odd, and it was as if it had always been there.'Sorry,' she said. 'I did the best I could do. It's better, but it's not right, yet.' She seemed lost in thought, then she said brightly, 'Why don't I replace it entirely? What about a cat's rear leg? Or a chicken's?'Odd smiled, and shook his head. 'My leg is fine,' he said.Odd stood up cautiously, put his weight on his right leg, trying to pretend he had not just seen his leg unhooked at the knee. It did not hurt. Not really. Not like it used to.'Give it time,' said Freya.A huge hand came down and clapped Odd on the shoulder, sending him flying.'Now, laddie,' boomed Thor. 'Tell us just how you defeated the might of the Frost Giants.' He seemed much more cheerful than when he had been a bear.'There was only one of them,' said Odd.'When I tell the story,' said Thor, 'there will be at least a dozen.''I want my shoes back,' said Loki.There was a feast that night in the great mead hall of the Gods. Odin sat at the end of the table, in the magnificent, carved chair, saying almost as little as he had when he was an eagle. Thor, on his left side, boomed enthusiastically. Loki, who had to sit down at the far end of the table, was pleasant enough to everyone until he got drunk, and then, like a candle suddenly blowing out, he became unpleasant, and he said mean, foolish, unrepeatable things, and he leered at the Goddesses, and soon enough Thor and a large man with one hand, who Odd thought might have been called Tyr, were carrying Loki from the hall.'He doesn't learn,' said Odd.He thought he had said it to himself, in his head, but Freya, who was sitting beside him, said, 'No. He doesn't learn. None of them do. And they don't change, either. They can't. It's all part of being a God.'Odd nodded. He thought he understood, a little.Then Freya said, 'Have you eaten enough? Have you drunk your fill?''Yes, thank you,' said Odd.Old Odin left his chair, and walked towards them. He wiped the goose grease from his mouth with his sleeve, smearing even more grease all over his grey beard. He said, quietly, intoOdd's ear, 'Do you know what spring it was you drank from, boy? Where the water came from?Do you know what it cost me to drink there, many years ago? You didn't think you defeated the Frost Giants alone, did you?'Odd said only, 'Thank you.''No,' said Odin. 'Thank you.' The All-father was leaning on a staff carved with faces-dogs and horses and men and birds, skulls and reindeer and mice and women-all of them wrapped around Odin's stick. You could look at it for hours and still not see every detail on that stick. Odin pushed the staff towards Odd and said, 'This is for you.'Odd said, 'But...'The old God looked at him gravely through his one good eye. 'It is never wise to refuse the gifts of the Gods, boy.'Odd said, 'Well, thank you.' And he took the staff. It was comfortable. It felt as though he could walk a long way, as long as he was leaning on that staff.Odin dipped his hand into a pitcher, brought it out holding a small globe of water no larger than a man's eyeball. He placed the water ball in front of a candle flame. 'Look into this,' he said.Odd looked into the ball of water, and his world became a rainbow, and then it went dark.When he opened his eyes, he was home.
OFG_ch8	OFG	Odd and the Frost Giants	8	699	3657	CHAPTER 8AFTERWARDSODD LEANED HIS WEIGHT on the staff and looked down at the village. Then he began to walk the path that would take him home. He was still limping, a little. His right foot would never be as strong as his left. But it did not hurt, and he was grateful to Freya for that.As he headed down the path to the village, he heard a rushing noise. It was the sound of snow melting, of new water trying to find its way to lower ground. Sometimes he heard a clump as snow fell from a tree onto the ground beneath, sometimes the deep thrum thrum thrum, followed by a harsh cracking sound, as the ice that had covered the edge of the bay through this eternal winter began to cleave and to break up.In a few days, Odd thought, this will all be mud. In a few weeks it will be a riot of greenery.Odd reached the village. For a moment he wondered if he had come to the wrong place, for nothing looked as he remembered it looking when he had left, less than a week before. He remembered how the animals had grown, when they reached Asgard, and then, how they seemed, later, to have shrunk.He wondered if it was the air of Asgard that did it, or if it had happened when he drank the water of the pool.He reached Fat Elfred's door and he rapped upon it sharply with his staff.'Who is it?' called a voice.'It's me. Odd,' he said.There was a noise inside the hut, an urgent whispering, then people talking in low voices.Odd could hear the loudest of the voices as it grumbled about good-for-nothings who stole a side of salmon, and how it was high time for someone to be taught a lesson he would never forget. He heard the sound of a door being unbarred.The door opened and Fat Elfred looked out. He stared at Odd, confused.'I'm sorry,' he said, in a most un-sorry tone of voice. 'I thought my runaway stepson was here.'Odd looked down at the man. Then he smiled and he said, 'It is him. I mean, it's me. I'm him. I'm Odd.'Fat Elfred said nothing. The heads of his various sons and daughters appeared around him.They looked up at Odd nervously.'Is my mother here?' asked Odd.Fat Elfred coughed. 'You grew,' he said. 'If that is you.'Odd just smiled-a smile so irritating that it had to be him.The smallest of Fat Elfred's children said, 'They got into fights after you went away. She said we had to go and look for you and that it was Dad's fault you'd run off, and he said it wasn't and he wouldn't and good riddance to bad rubbish and she said right then, and she went back to your father's old house on the other side of town.''It is him. I mean, it's me. I'm him. I'm Odd.'Odd winked down at the boy, as Thor had once winked at him, and turned around and, leaning on his carved staff, limped through the village, which already seemed much too small for him and not just because he had grown so much since he had left. Soon the ice would melt and longships would be sailing. He did not imagine anyone would refuse him a berth on a ship. Not now that he was big. They would need a good pair of hands on the oars, after all. Nor would they argue if he chose to bring a passenger...He reached down and knocked on the door of the house in which he had been born. And when his mother opened the door, before she could hug him, before she could cry and laugh and cry once more, before she could offer him food and exclaim over how big he had grown and how fast children do spring up when they are out of your sight, before any of these things could happen, Odd said, 'Hello, Mother. How would you like to go back to Scotland? For a while, at least.''That would be a fine thing,' she said.And Odd smiled, and ducked his head to get through the door, and went inside.

AN INTRODUCTION
Writing is flying in dreams.When you remember. When you can. When it works.It's that easy.- AUTHOR'S NOTEBOOK, FEBRUARY 1992They do it with mirrors. It's a cliché, of course, but it's also true. Magicians have been using mirrors, usually set at a forty-five-degree angle, ever since the Victorians began to manufacture reliable, clear mirrors in quantity, well over a hundred years ago. John Nevil Maskelyne began it, in 1862, with a wardrobe that, thanks to a cunningly placed mirror, concealed more than it revealed.Mirrors are wonderful things. They appear to tell the truth, to reflect life back out at us; but set a mirror correctly and it will lie so convincingly you'll believe that something has vanished into thin air, that a box filled with doves and flags and spiders is actually empty, that people hidden in the wings or the pit are floating ghosts upon the stage. Angle it right and a mirror becomes a magic casement; it can show you anything you can imagine and maybe a few things you can't.(The smoke blurs the edges of things.)Stories are, in one way or another, mirrors. We use them to explain to ourselves how the world works or how it doesn't work. Like mirrors, stories prepare us for the day to come. They distract us from the things in the darkness.Fantasy-and all fiction is fantasy of one kind or another-is a mirror. A distorting mirror, to be sure, and a concealing mirror, set at forty-five degrees to reality, but it's a mirror nonetheless, which we can use to tell ourselves things we might not otherwise see. (Fairy tales, as G. K. Chesterton once said, are more than true. Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be defeated.)Winter started today. The sky turned gray and the snow began to fall and it did not stop falling until well after dark. I sat in the darkness and watched the snow falling, and the flakes glistened and glimmered as they spun into the light and out again, and I wondered about where stories came from.This is the kind of thing that you wonder about when you make things up for a living. I remain unconvinced that it is the kind of activity that is a fit occupation for an adult, but it's too late now: I seem to have a career that I enjoy which doesn't involve getting up too early in the morning. (When I was a child, adults would tell me not to make things up, warning me of what would happen if I did. As far as I can tell so far it seems to involve lots of foreign travel and not having to get up too early in the morning.) Most of the stories in this book were written to entertain the various editors who had asked me for tales for specific anthologies (""It's for an anthology of stories about the Holy Grail,"" "". . . about sex,"" "" . . . of fairy stories retold for adults,"" "". . . about sex and horror,"" "". . . of revenge stories,"" "". . . about superstition,"" "". . . about more sex""). A few of them were written to amuse myself or, more precisely, to get an idea or an image out of my head and pinned safely down on paper; which is as good a reason for writing as I know: releasing demons, letting them fly. Some of the stories began in idleness: fancies and curiosities that got out of hand.I once made up a story as a wedding present for some friends. It was about a couple who were given a story as a wedding present. It was not a reassuring story. Having made up the story, I decided that they'd probably prefer a toaster, so I got them a toaster, and to this day have not written the story down. It sits in the back of my head to this day, waiting for someone to get married who would appreciate it.It occurs to me now (writing this introduction in blue-black fountain pen ink in a black-bound notebook, in case you were wondering) that, although one way or another most of the stories in this book are about love in some form or another, there aren't enough happy stories, stories of properly requited love to balance out all the other kinds you'll find in this book; and indeed, that there are people who don't read introductions. For that matter, some of you out there may be having weddings one day, after all. So for all of you who do read introductions, here is the story I did not write. (And if I don't like the story once it's written, I can always cross out this paragraph, and you'll never know that I stopped writing the introduction to start writing a story instead.)THE WEDDING PRESENTAfter all the joys and the headaches of the wedding, after the madness and the magic of it all (not to mention the embarrassment of Belinda's father's after-dinner speech, complete with family slide show), after the honeymoon was literally (although not yet metaphorically) over and before their new suntans had a chance to fade in the English autumn, Belinda and Gordon got down to the business of unwrapping the wedding presents and writing their thank you letters-thank yous enough for every towel and every toaster, for the juicer and the breadmaker, for the cutlery and the crockery and the teasmade and the curtains.""Right,"" said Gordon. ""That's the large objects thank-you'd. What've we got left?""""Things in envelopes,"" said Belinda. ""Checks, I hope.""There were several checks, a number of gift tokens, and even a £10 book token from Gordon's Aunt Marie, who was poor as a church mouse, Gordon told Belinda, but a dear, and who had sent him a book token every birthday as long as he could remember. And then, at the very bottom of the pile, there was a large brown businesslike envelope.""What is it?"" asked Belinda.Gordon opened the flap and pulled out a sheet of paper the color of two-day-old cream, ragged at top and bottom, with typing on one side. The words had been typed with a manual typewriter, something Gordon had not seen in some years. He read the page slowly.""What is it?"" asked Belinda. ""Who's it from?""""I don't know,"" said Gordon. ""Someone who still owns a typewriter. It's not signed.""""Is it a letter?""""Not exactly,"" he said, and he scratched the side of his nose and read it again.""Well,"" she said in an exasperated voice (but she was not really exasperated; she was happy. She would wake in the morning and check to see if she were still as happy as she had been when she went to sleep the night before, or when Gordon had woken her in the night by brushing up against her, or when she had woken him. And she was). ""Well, what is it?""""It appears to be a description of our wedding,"" he said. ""It's very nicely written. Here,"" and he passed it to her.She looked it over.It was a crisp day in early October when Gordon Robert Johnson and Belinda Karen Abingdon swore that they would love each other, would support and honor each other as long as they both should live. The bride was radiant and lovely, the groom was nervous, but obviously proud and just as obviously pleased.That was how it began. It went on to describe the service and the reception clearly, simply, and amusingly.""How sweet,"" she said. ""What does it say on the envelope?"""" 'Gordon and Belinda's Wedding,' "" he read.""No name? Nothing to indicate who sent it?""""Uh-uh.""""Well, it's very sweet, and it's very thoughtful,"" she said. ""Whoever it's from.""She looked inside the envelope to see if there was something else inside that they had overlooked, a note from whichever one of her friends (or his, or theirs) had written it, but there wasn't, so, vaguely relieved that there was one less thank you note to write, she placed the cream sheet of paper back in its envelope, which she placed in a box file, along with a copy of the wedding banquet menu, and the invitations, and the contact sheets for the wedding photographs, and one white rose from the bridal bouquet.Gordon was an architect, and Belinda was a vet. For each of them what they did was a vocation, not a job. They were in their early twenties. Neither of them had been married before, nor even seriously involved with anyone. They met when Gordon brought his thirteen-year-old golden retriever, Goldie, gray-muzzled and half-paralyzed, to Belinda's surgery to be put down. He had had the dog since he was a boy and insisted on being with her at the end. Belinda held his hand as he cried, and then, suddenly and unprofessionally, she hugged him, tightly, as if she could squeeze away the pain and the loss and the grief. One of them asked the other if they could meet that evening in the local pub for a drink, and afterward neither of them was sure which of them had proposed it.The most important thing to know about the first two years of their marriage was this: they were pretty happy. From time to time they would squabble, and every once in a while they would have a blazing row about nothing very much that would end in tearful reconciliations, and they would make love and kiss away the other's tears and whisper heartfelt apologies into each other's ears. At the end of the second year, six months after she came off the pill, Brenda found herself pregnant.Gordon bought her a bracelet studded with tiny rubies, and he turned the spare bedroom into a nursery, hanging the wallpaper himself. The wallpaper was covered with nursery rhyme characters, with Little Bo Peep, and Humpty Dumpty, and the Dish Running Away with the Spoon, over and over and over again.Belinda came home from the hospital, with little Melanie in her carry-cot, and Belinda's mother came to stay with them for a week, sleeping on the sofa in the lounge.It was on the third day that Belinda pulled out the box file to show her wedding souvenirs to her mother and to reminisce. Already their wedding seemed like such a long time ago. They smiled at the dried brown thing that had once been a white rose, and clucked over the menu and the invitation. At the bottom of the box was a large brown envelope.""'Gordon and Belinda's Marriage,' "" read Belinda's mother.""It's a description of our wedding,"" said Belinda. ""It's very sweet. It even has a bit in it about Daddy's slide show.""Belinda opened the envelope and pulled out the sheet of cream paper. She read what was typed upon the paper, and made a face. Then she put it away without saying anything.""Can't I see it, dear?"" asked her mother.""I think it's Gordon playing a joke,"" said Belinda. ""Not in good taste, either.""Belinda was sitting up in bed that night, breastfeeding Melanie, when she said to Gordon, who was staring at his wife and new daughter with a foolish smile upon his face, ""Darling, why did you write those things?""""What things?""""In the letter. That wedding thing. You know.""""I don't know.""""It wasn't funny.""He sighed. ""What are you talking about?""Belinda pointed to the box file, which she had brought upstairs and placed upon her dressing table. Gordon opened it and took out the envelope. ""Did it always say that on the envelope?"" he asked. ""I thought it said something about our wedding."" Then he took out and read the single sheet of ragged-edged paper, and his forehead creased. ""I didn't write this."" He turned the paper over, staring at the blank side as if expecting to see something else written there.""You didn't write it?"" she asked. ""Really you didn't?"" Gordon shook his head. Belinda wiped a dribble of milk from the baby's chin. ""I believe you,"" she said. ""I thought you wrote it, but you didn't.""""No.""""Let me see that again,"" she said. He passed the paper to her. ""This is so weird. I mean, it's not funny, and it's not even true.""Typed upon the paper was a brief description of the previous two years for Gordon and Belinda. It had not been a good two years, according to the typed sheet. Six months after they were married, Belinda had been bitten in the cheek by a Pekingese, so badly that the cheek needed to be stitched back together. It had left a nasty scar. Worse than that, nerves had been damaged, and she had begun to drink, perhaps to numb the pain. She suspected that Gordon was revolted by her face, while the new baby, it said, was a desperate attempt to glue the couple together.""Why would they say this?"" she asked.""They?""""Whoever wrote this horrid thing."" She ran a finger across her cheek: it was unblemished and unmarked. She was a very beautiful young woman, although she looked tired and fragile now.""How do you know it's a 'they'?""""I don't know,"" she said, transferring the baby to her left breast. ""It seems a sort of 'they'-ish thing to do. To write that and to swap it for the old one and to wait until one of us read it . . . Come on, little Melanie, there you go, that's such a fine girl . . . """"Shall I throw it away?""""Yes. No. I don't know. I think . . . "" She stroked the baby's forehead. ""Hold on to it,"" she said. ""We might need it for evidence. I wonder if it was something Al organized."" Al was Gordon's youngest brother.Gordon put the paper back into the envelope, and he put the envelope back into the box file, which was pushed under the bed and, more or less, forgotten.Neither of them got much sleep for the next few months, what with the nightly feeds and the continual crying, for Melanie was a colicky baby. The box file stayed under the bed. And then Gordon was offered a job in Preston, several hundred miles north, and since Belinda was on leave from her job and had no immediate plans to go back to work, she found the idea rather attractive. So they moved.They found a terraced house on a cobbled street, high and old and deep. Belinda filled in from time to time at a local vet's, seeing small animals and housepets. When Melanie was eighteen months old, Belinda gave birth to a son, whom they called Kevin after Gordon's late grandfather.Gordon was made a full partner in the firm of architects. When Kevin began to go to kindergarten, Belinda went back to work.The box file was never lost. It was in one of the spare rooms at the top of the house, beneath a teetering pile of copies of The Architect's Journal and Architectural Review. Belinda thought about the box file, and what it contained, from time to time, and, one night when Gordon was in Scotland overnight consulting on the remodeling of an ancestral home, she did more than think.Both of the children were asleep. Belinda went up the stairs into the undecorated part of the house. She moved the magazines and opened the box, which (where it had not been covered by magazines) was thick with two years of undisturbed dust. The envelope still said Gordon and Belinda's Marriage on it, and Belinda honestly did not know if it had ever said anything else.She took out the paper from the envelope, and she read it. And then she put it away, and sat there, at the top of the house, feeling shaken and sick.According to the neatly typed message, Kevin, her second child, had not been born; the baby had been miscarried at five months. Since then Belinda had been suffering from frequent attacks of bleak, black depression. Gordon was home rarely, it said, because he was conducting a rather miserable affair with the senior partner in his company, a striking but nervous woman ten years his senior. Belinda was drinking more, and affecting high collars and scarves to hide the spiderweb scar upon her cheek. She and Gordon spoke little, except to argue the small and petty arguments of those who fear the big arguments, knowing that the only things that were left to be said were too huge to be said without destroying both their lives.Belinda said nothing about the latest version of Gordon and Belinda's Marriage to Gordon. However, he read it himself, or something quite like it, several months later, when Belinda's mother fell ill, and Belinda went south for a week to help look after her.On the sheet of paper that Gordon took out of the envelope was a portrait of a marriage similar to the one that Belinda had read, although, at present, his affair with his boss had ended badly, and his job was now in peril.Gordon rather liked his boss, but could not imagine himself ever becoming romantically involved with her. He was enjoying his job, although he wanted something that would challenge him more than it did.Belinda's mother improved, and Belinda came home again within the week. Her husband and children were relieved and delighted to see her.It was Christmas Eve before Gordon spoke to Belinda about the envelope.""You've looked at it too, haven't you?"" They had crept into the children's bedrooms earlier that evening and filled the hanging Christmas stockings. Gordon had felt euphoric as he had walked through the house, as he stood beside his children's beds, but it was a euphoria tinged with a profound sorrow: the knowledge that such moments of complete happiness could not last; that one could not stop Time.Belinda knew what he was talking about. ""Yes,"" she said, ""I've read it.""""What do you think?""""Well,"" she said. ""I don't think it's a joke anymore. Not even a sick joke.""""Mm,"" he said. ""Then what is it?""They sat in the living room at the front of the house with the lights dimmed, and the log burning on the bed of coals cast flickering orange and yellow light about the room.""I think it really is a wedding present,"" she told him. ""It's the marriage that we aren't having. The bad things are happening there, on the page, not here, in our lives. Instead of living it, we are reading it, knowing it could have gone that way and also that it never did.""""You're saying it's magic, then?"" He would not have said it aloud, but it was Christmas Eve, and the lights were down.""I don't believe in magic,"" she said, flatly. ""It's a wedding present. And I think we should make sure it's kept safe.""On Boxing Day she moved the envelope from the box file to her jewelry drawer, which she kept locked, where it lay flat beneath her necklaces and rings, her bracelets and her brooches.Spring became summer. Winter became spring.Gordon was exhausted. By day he worked for clients, designing, and liaising with builders and contractors; by night he would sit up late, working for himself, designing museums and galleries and public buildings for competitions. Sometimes his designs received honorable mentions, and were reproduced in architectural journals.Belinda was doing more large animal work, which she enjoyed, visiting farmers and inspecting and treating horses, sheep, and cows. Sometimes she would bring the children with her on her rounds.Her mobile phone rang when she was in a paddock trying to examine a pregnant goat who had, it turned out, no desire to be caught, let alone examined. She retired from the battle, leaving the goat glaring at her from across the field, and thumbed the phone open. ""Yes?""""Guess what?""""Hello darling. Um. You've won the lottery?""""Nope. Close, though. My design for the British Heritage Museum has made the short list. I'm up against some pretty stiff contenders, though. But I'm on the short list.""""That's wonderful!""""I've spoken to Mrs. Fulbright and she's going to have Sonja baby-sit for us tonight. We're celebrating.""""Terrific. Love you,"" she said. ""Now got to get back to the goat.""They drank too much champagne over a fine celebratory meal. That night in their bedroom as Belinda removed her earrings, she said, ""Shall we see what the wedding present says?""He looked at her gravely from the bed. He was only wearing his socks. ""No, I don't think so. It's a special night. Why spoil it?""She placed her earrings in her jewelry drawer, and locked it. Then she removed her stockings. ""I suppose you're right. I can imagine what it says, anyway. I'm drunk and depressed and you're a miserable loser. And meanwhile we're . . . well, actually I am a bit tiddly, but that's not what I mean. It just sits there at the bottom of the drawer, like the portrait in the attic in The Picture of Dorian Gray."""" 'And it was only by his rings that they knew him.' Yes. I remember. We read it in school.""""That's really what I'm scared of,"" she said, pulling on a cotton nightdress. ""That the thing on that paper is the real portrait of our marriage at present, and what we've got now is just a pretty picture. That it's real, and we're not. I mean""-she was speaking intently now, with the gravity of the slightly drunk-""don't you ever think that it's too good to be true?""He nodded. ""Sometimes. Tonight, certainly.""She shivered. ""Maybe really I am a drunk with a dog bite on my cheek, and you fuck anything that moves and Kevin was never born and- and all that other horrible stuff.""He stood up, walked over to her, put his arms around her.""But it isn't true,"" he pointed out. ""This is real. You're real. I'm real. That wedding thing is just a story. It's just words."" And he kissed her, and held her tightly, and little more was said that night.It was a long six months before Gordon's design for the British Heritage Museum was announced as the winning design, although it was derided in The Times as being too ""aggressively modern,"" in various architectural journals as being too old-fashioned, and it was described by one of the judges, in an interview in the Sunday Telegraph, as ""a bit of a compromise candidate-everybody's second choice.""They moved to London, letting their house in Preston to an artist and his family, for Belinda would not let Gordon sell it. Gordon worked intensively, happily, on the museum project. Kevin was six and Melanie was eight. Melanie found London intimidating, but Kevin loved it. Both of the children were initially distressed to have lost their friends and their school. Belinda found a part-time job at a small animal clinic in Camden, working three afternoons a week. She missed her cows.Days in London became months and then years, and, despite occasional budgetary setbacks, Gordon was increasingly excited. The day approached when the first ground would be broken for the museum.One night Belinda woke in the small hours, and she stared at her sleeping husband in the sodium-yellow illumination of the streetlamp outside their bedroom window. His hairline was receding, and the hair at back was thinning. Belinda wondered what it would be like when she was actually married to a bald man. She decided it would be much the same as it always had been. Mostly happy. Mostly good.She wondered what was happening to the them in the envelope. She could feel its presence, dry and brooding, in the corner of their bedroom, safely locked away from all harm. She felt, suddenly, sorry for the Belinda and Gordon trapped in the envelope on their piece of paper, hating each other and everything else.Gordon began to snore. She kissed him, gently, on the cheek, and said, ""Shhh."" He stirred, and was quiet, but did not wake. She snuggled against him and soon fell back into sleep herself.After lunch the following day, while in conversation with an importer of Tuscan marble, Gordon looked very surprised and reached a hand up to his chest. He said, ""I'm frightfully sorry about this,"" and then his knees gave way, and he fell to the floor. They called an ambulance, but Gordon was dead when it arrived. He was thirty-six years old.At the inquest the coroner announced that the autopsy showed Gordon's heart to have been congenitally weak. It could have gone at any time.For the first three days after his death, Belinda felt nothing, a profound and awful nothing. She comforted the children, she spoke to her friends and to Gordon's friends, to her family and to Gordon's family, accepting their condolences gracefully and gently, as one accepts unasked-for gifts. She would listen to people cry for Gordon, which she still had not done. She would say all the right things, and she would feel nothing at all.Melanie, who was eleven, seemed to be taking it well. Kevin abandoned his books and computer games, and sat in his bedroom, staring out of the window, not wanting to talk.The day after the funeral her parents went back to the countryside, taking both the children with them. Belinda refused to go. There was, she said, too much to do.On the fourth day after the funeral she was making the double bed that she and Gordon had shared when she began to cry, and the sobs ripped through her in huge ugly spasms of grief, and tears fell from her face onto the bedspread and clear snot streamed from her nose, and she sat down on the floor suddenly, like a marionette whose strings had been cut, and she cried for the best part of an hour, for she knew that she would never see him again.She wiped her face. Then she unlocked her jewelry drawer and took out the envelope and opened it. She pulled out the cream-colored sheet of paper and ran her eyes over the neatly typed words. The Belinda on the paper had crashed their car while drunk and was about to lose her driving license. She and Gordon had not spoken for days. He had lost his job almost eighteen months earlier and now spent most of his days sitting around their house in Salford. Belinda's job brought in what money they had. Melanie was out of control: Belinda, cleaning Melanie's bedroom, had found a cache of five and ten pound notes. Melanie had offered no explanation for how an eleven-year-old girl had come by the money, had just retreated into her room and glared at them, tight-lipped, when quizzed. Neither Gordon nor Belinda had investigated further, scared of what they might have discovered. The house in Salford was dingy and damp, such that the plaster was coming away from the ceiling in huge crumbling chunks, and all three of them had developed nasty bronchial coughs.Belinda felt sorry for them.She put the paper back in the envelope. She wondered what it would be like to hate Gordon, to have him hate her. She wondered what it would be like not to have Kevin in her life, not to see his drawings of airplanes or hear his magnificently tuneless renditions of popular songs. She wondered where Melanie-the other Melanie, not her Melanie but the there-but-for-the-grace-of-God Melanie-could have got that money and was relieved that her own Melanie seemed to have few interests beyond ballet and Enid Blyton books.She missed Gordon so much it felt like something sharp being hammered into her chest, a spike, perhaps, or an icicle, made of cold and loneliness and the knowledge that she would never see him again in this world.Then she took the envelope downstairs to the lounge, where the coal fire was burning in the grate, because Gordon had loved open fires. He said that a fire gave a room life. She disliked coal fires, but she had lit it this evening out of routine and out of habit, and because not lighting it would have meant admitting to herself, on some absolute level, that he was never coming home.Belinda stared into the fire for some time, thinking about what she had in her life, and what she had given up; and whether it would be worse to love someone who was no longer there, or not to love someone who was.And then, at the end, almost casually, she tossed the envelope onto the coals, and she watched it curl and blacken and catch, watched the yellow flames dancing amidst the blue.Soon the wedding present was nothing but black flakes of ash which danced on the updrafts and were carried away, like a child's letter to Santa Claus, up the chimney and off into the night.Belinda sat back in her chair, and closed her eyes, and waited for the scar to blossom on her cheek.And that is the story I did not write for my friends' wedding. Although, of course, it's not the story I did not write or even the story I set out to write when I began it, some pages ago. The story I thought I was setting out to write was much shorter, much more fablelike, and it did not end like that. (I don't know how it did end originally anymore. There was some kind of ending, but once the story was underway the real ending became inevitable.)Most of the stories in this volume have that much in common: The place they arrived at in the end was not the place I was expecting them to go when I set out. Sometimes the only way I would know that a story had finished was when there weren't any more words to be written down.Reading the Entrails: A RondelEditors who ask me for stories about "" . . . anything you want. Honest. Anything at all. Just write the story you always wanted to write"" rarely get anything at all.In this case, Lawrence Schimel wrote asking for a poem to introduce his anthology of stories about foretelling the future. He wanted one of the verse forms with repeating lines, like a villanelle or a pantoum, to echo the way we inevitably arrive at our future.So I wrote him a rondel about the pleasures and perils of fortune-telling and prefaced it with the bleakest joke in Through the Looking-Glass. Somehow it seemed a fine starting point for this book.ChivalryI'd been having a bad week. The script I was meant to be writing just wasn't happening, and I'd spent days staring at a blank screen, occasionally writing a word like the and staring at it for an hour or so and then, slowly, letter by letter, I'd delete it and write and or but instead. Then I'd exit without saving. Ed Kramer phoned and reminded me that I owed him a story for an anthology of stories about the Holy Grail which he was editing with the ubiquitous Marty Greenberg. And seeing nothing else was happening and that this story was living in the back of my mind, I said sure.I wrote it in a weekend, a gift from the gods, easy and sweet as anything. Suddenly I was a writer transformed: I laughed in the face of danger and spat on the shoes of writer's block. Then I sat and stared glumly at a blank screen for another week, because the gods have a sense of humor.Several years ago, on a signing tour, someone gave me a copy of an academic paper on feminist language theory that compared and contrasted ""Chivalry,"" Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shalott,"" and a Madonna song. I hope one day to write a story called ""Mrs. Whitaker's Werewolf"" and wonder what sort of papers that might provoke.When I do live readings, I tend to start with this story. It's a very friendly story and I enjoy reading it aloud.Nicholas Was . . .Every Christmas I get cards from artists. They paint them themselves or draw them. They are things of beauty, monuments to inspired creativity.Every Christmas I feel insignificant and embarrassed and talentless.So I wrote this one year, wrote it early for Christmas. Dave McKean calligraphed it elegantly and I sent it out to everyone I could think of. My card.It's exactly 100 words long (102, including the title) and first saw print in Drabble II, a collection of 100-word-long short stories. I keep meaning to do another Christmas card story, but it's always December 15 before I remember, so I put it off until next year.The PriceMy literary agent, Ms. Merrilee Heifetz of New York, is one of the coolest people in the world, and she has only once, to the best of my recollection, ever suggested that I should write a specific book. This was some time ago. ""Listen,"" she said, ""angels are big these days, and people always like books about cats, so I thought, 'Wouldn't it be cool if someone did a book about a cat who was an angel or an angel who was a cat or something?' ""And I agreed that it was a solid commercial idea and that I would think about it. Unfortunately, by the time I had finally finished thinking about it, books about angels were the-year-before-last-year's thing. Still, the idea was planted, and one day I wrote this story.(For the curious: Eventually a young lady fell in love with the Black Cat, and he went to live with her, and the last time I saw him he was the size of a very small mountain lion, and for all I know he's growing still. Two weeks after the Black Cat left, a brown tabby arrived and moved onto the porch. As I write this, he's asleep on the back of the sofa a few feet away from me.)While I think of it, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my family for letting me put them in this story, and, more importantly, both for leaving me alone to write, and for sometimes insisting I come out to play.Troll BridgeThis story was nominated for a 1994 World Fantasy Award, although it didn't win. It was written for Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling's Snow White, Blood Red, an anthology of retellings of fairy tales for adults. I chose the tale of ""The Three Billy Goats Gruff."" Had Gene Wolfe, one of my favorite writers (and, it occurs to me now, another person who hid a story in an introduction), not taken the title many years earlier, I would have called it ""Trip Trap.""Don't Ask JackLisa Snellings is a remarkable sculptor. This was written about the first of her sculptures I saw and fell in love with: a demonic jack-in-the-box. She gave me a copy of it and has promised me the original in her will, she says. Each of her sculptures is like a story, frozen in wood or plaster. (There is one on my mantelpiece of a winged girl in a cage offering passersby a feather from her wings while her captor sleeps; I suspect that this one is a novel. We'll see.)The Goldfish Pool and Other StoriesThe mechanics of writing fascinate me. This story was begun in 1991. Three pages were written and then, feeling too close to the material, I abandoned it. Finally, in 1994, I decided to finish it for an anthology to be edited by Janet Berliner and David Copperfield. I wrote it higgledy-piggledy on a battered Atari Portfolio palmtop, on planes and in cars and hotel rooms, all out of order, jotting down conversations and imaginary meetings until I was fairly sure it was all written. Then I put the material I had in order and was astonished and delighted that it worked.Some of this story is true.Triptych: Eaten (Scenes from a Moving Picture), The White Road, Queen of KnivesOver a period of several months a few years ago, I wrote three narrative poems. Each story was about violence, about men and women, about love. The first of the three to be written was a treatment for a pornographic horror movie, written in strict iambic pentameter, which I called ""Eaten (Scenes from a Moving Picture)."" It was fairly extreme (and, I'm afraid, is not reprinted in this volume). The second was a retelling of a number of old English folktales called ""The White Road."" It was as extreme as the stories it was based on. The last to be written was a tale about my maternal grandparents and about stage magic. It was less extreme, but-I hope-just as disturbing as the two stories that preceded it in the sequence. I was proud of all three of them. The vagaries of publishing meant they were actually published over a period of years, so each of them made it into a best of the year anthology (all three of them were picked up in the American Year's Best Fantasy and Horror, one in the British Year's Best Horror, and one, somewhat to my surprise, was solicited for an international best erotica collection).The White RoadThere are two stories that have both haunted and disturbed me over the years, stories that have attracted and repelled me ever since I encountered them as a small boy. One of them is the tale of Sweeney Todd, ""the demon barber of Fleet Street."" The other is the tale of Mr. Fox-it's a sort of English version of Bluebeard.The versions in this retelling of the story were inspired by variants on the tale I found in The Penguin Book of English Folktales, edited by Neil Philip: ""The Story of Mr. Fox"" and the notes that follow it and a version of the tale called ""Mr. Foster,"" where I found the image of the white road and the way that the girl's suitor marked the trail down the white road to his gruesome house.In the story of Mr. Fox, the refrain ""It was not so, it is not so, and God forbid it should be so"" is repeated as a litany, through the recounting of each horror that Mr. Fox's fianceé claims she saw in a dream. At the end she throws down the bloody finger, or the hand, that she took from his house and proves that everything she said was true. And then his story is effectively over.It's also about all the strange Chinese and Japanese folktales in which, ultimately, everything comes down to Foxes.Queen of KnivesThis, like my graphic novel Mr. Punch, is close enough to the truth that I have had, on occasion, to explain to some of my relatives that it didn't really happen. Well, not like that, anyway.ChangesLisa Tuttle phoned me one day to ask me for a story for an anthology she was editing about gender. I have always loved SF as a medium, and when I was young, I was certain that I would grow up to be a science fiction writer. I never really did. When I first had the idea for this story, almost a decade ago, it was a set of linked short stories that would have formed a novel exploring the world of gender reflection. But I never wrote any of those stories. When Lisa called, it occurred to me that I could take the world I'd imagined and tell its story in the same way that Eduardo Galeano told the history of the Americas in his Memory of Fire trilogy.Once I'd finished the story, I showed it to a friend, who said it read like an outline for a novel. All I could do was congratulate her on her perspicacity. But Lisa Tuttle liked it, and so do I.The Daughter of OwlsJohn Aubrey, the seventeenth-century collector and historian, is one of my favorite writers. His writings contain a potent mixture of credulity and erudition, of anecdote, reminiscence, and conjecture. Reading Aubrey's work, one gets an immediate sense of a real person talking from the past in a way that transcends the centuries: an enormously likable, interesting person. Also, I like his spelling. I tried writing this story in a couple of different ways, and I was never satisfied with it. Then it occurred to me to write it as by Aubrey.Shoggoth's Old PeculiarThe overnight train to Glasgow from London is a sleeper that gets in at about five in the morning. When I got off the train, I walked to the station hotel and went inside. I intended to walk down the hall to the reception desk and get a room, then get some more sleep, and then, once everyone was up and about, I planned to spend the next couple of days at the science fiction convention that was being held in the hotel. Officially, I was covering it for a national newspaper.On the way down the hall to the reception desk, I passed the bar, empty but for a bemused barman and an English fan named John Jarrold, who, as the Fan Guest of Honor at the convention, had been given an open bar tab, which he was using while others slept.So I stopped to talk to John and never actually made it to the reception desk. We spent the next forty-eight hours chatting, telling jokes and stories, and enthusiastically massacring all we could remember of Guys and Dolls in the small hours of the next morning, when the bar had started to empty out again. At one point in that bar, I had a conversation with the late Richard Evans, an English SF editor, that, six years later, would start to turn intoNeverwhere.I no longer remember quite why John and I began talking about Cthulhu in the voices of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, nor why I decided to start lecturing John on H. P. Lovecraft's prose style. I suspect it had something to do with lack of sleep.These days John Jarrold is a respectable editor and a bastion of the British publishing industry. Some of the middle bits of this story began life in that bar, with John and I doing Pete and Dud as creatures out of H. P. Lovecraft. Mike Ashley was the editor who cajoled me into making them a story.VirusThis was written for David Barrett's Digital Dreams, a computer fiction anthology. I don't play many computer games anymore. When I did, I noticed they tended to take up areas of my head. Blocks fell or little men ran and jumped behind my eyelids as I went to sleep. Mostly I'd lose, even when playing with my mind. This came from that.Looking for the GirlThis story was commissioned by Penthouse for their twentieth-anniversary issue, January 1985. For the previous couple of years I'd been surviving as a young journalist on the streets of London by interviewing celebrities for Penthouse and Knave, two English ""skin"" magazines-tamer by far than their American equivalents; it was an education, all things considered.I asked a model once if she felt she was being exploited. ""Me?"" she said. Her name was Marie. ""I'm getting well paid for it, love. And it beats working the night shift in a Bradford biscuit factory. But I'll tell you who's being exploited. All those blokes who buy it. Wanking over me every month. They're being exploited."" I think this story began with that conversation.I was satisfied with this story when I wrote it: It was the first fiction I had written that sounded in any way like me and that didn't read like me doing someone else. I was edging toward a style. To research the story, I sat in the Penthouse U.K. Docklands offices and thumbed through twenty years' worth of bound magazines. In the first Penthouse was my friend Dean Smith. Dean did makeup for Knave, and, it turned out, she'd been the very first Penthouse Pet of the Year in 1965. I stole the 1965 Charlotte blurb directly from Dean's blurb, ""Resurgent individualist"" and all. The last I heard, Penthouse was hunting for Dean for their twenty-fifth-anniversary celebrations. She'd dropped out of sight. It was in all the newspapers.It occurred to me, while I was looking at two decades of Penthouses, that Penthouse and magazines like it had absolutely nothing to do with women and absolutely everything to do with photographs of women. And that was the other place the story began.Only the End of the World AgainSteve Jones and I have been friends for fifteen years. We even edited a book of nasty poems for kids together. This means that he gets to ring me up and say things like ""I'm doing an anthology of stories set in H. P. Lovecraft's fictional town of Innsmouth. Do me a story.""This story came from a number of things coming together (that's where we writers Get Our Ideas, in case you were wondering). One of them was the late Roger Zelazny's book A Night in the Lonesome October, which has tremendous fun with the various stock characters of horror and fantasy: Roger had given me a copy of his book a few months before I came to write this story, and I'd enjoyed it enormously. At about the same time, I was reading an account of a French werewolf trial held 300 years ago. I realized while reading the testimony of one witness that the account of this trial had been an inspiration for Saki's wonderful story ""Gabriel-Ernest"" and also for James Branch Cabell's short novel The White Robe, but that both Saki and Cabell had been too well brought up to use the throwing-up of the fingers motif, a key piece of evidence in the trial. Which meant that it was now all up to me.Larry Talbot was the name of the original Wolfman, the one who met Abbott and Costello.Bay WolfAnd there was that man Steve Jones again. ""I want you to write one of your story poems for me. It needs to be a detective story, set in the near future. Maybe you could use the Larry Talbot character from 'Only the End of the World Again.' ""It happened that I had just finished co-writing a screen adaptation of Beowulf, the old English narrative poem, and was mildly surprised by the number of people who, mishearing me, seemed to think I had just written an episode of ""Baywatch."" So I began retelling Beowulf as a futuristic episode of ""Baywatch"" for an anthology of detective stories. It seemed to be the only sensible thing to do.Look, I don't give you grief over where you get your ideas from.We Can Get Them for You WholesaleIf the stories in this book were arranged in chronological order, rather than in the strange and haphazard well-it-feels-right sort of order I have put them in, this story would be the first in the book. I dozed off one night in 1983, listening to the radio. When I fell asleep, I was listening to a piece on buying in bulk; when I woke up, they were talking about hired killers. That was where this story came from.I'd been reading a lot of John Collier short stories before I wrote this. Rereading it several years ago, I realized that it was a John Collier story. Not as good as any good John Collier story, nor written as well as Collier wrote; but it's still a Collier story for all that, and I hadn't noticed that when I was writing it.One Life, Furnished in Early MoorcockWhen I was asked to write a story for an anthology of Michael Moorcock's Elric stories, I chose to write a story about a boy a lot like I was once and his relationship with fiction. I doubted I could say anything about Elric that wasn't pastiche, but when I was twelve, Moorcock's characters were as real to me as anything else in my life and a great deal more real than, well, geography lessons for a start.""Of all the anthology stories, I liked your story and Tad Williams's the best,"" said Michael Moorcock when I ran into him in New Orleans several months after finishing the story. ""And I liked his better than yours because it had Jimi Hendrix in it.""The title is stolen from a Harlan Ellison short story.Cold ColorsI've worked in a number of different media over the years. Sometimes people ask me how I know what medium an idea belongs to. Mostly they turn up as comics or films or poems or prose or novels or short stories or whatever. You know what you're writing ahead of time.This, on the other hand, was just an idea. I wanted to say something about those infernal machines, computers, and black magic, and something about the London I observed in the late eighties-a period of financial excess and moral bankruptcy. It didn't seem to be a short story or a novel, so I tried it as a poem, and it did just fine.For The Time Out Book of London Short Stories I reformatted it as prose and left a lot of readers very puzzled.The Sweeper of DreamsThis one began with a Lisa Snellings statue of a man leaning on a broom. He was obviously some kind of janitor. I wondered what kind, and that was where this story came from.Foreign PartsThis is another early story. I wrote it in 1984, and I did the final draft (a hasty coat of paint and some grouting in the nastiest cracks) in 1989. In 1984 I couldn't sell it (the SF mags didn't like the sex, the sex mags didn't like the disease). In 1987 I was asked if I would sell it to an anthology of sexual SF stories, but I declined. In 1984 I had written a story about a venereal disease. The same story seemed to say different things in 1987. The story itself might not have changed, but the landscape around it had altered mightily: I'm talking about AIDS here, and so, whether I had intended it or not, was the story. If I was going to rewrite the story, I was going to have to take AIDS into account, and I couldn't. It was too big, too unknown, too hard to get a grip on. But by 1989 the cultural landscape had shifted once more, shifted to the point where I felt, if not comfortable, then less uncomfortable about taking the story out of the cabinet, brushing it down, wiping the smudges off its face, and sending it out to meet the nice people. So when editor Steve Niles asked if I had anything unpublished for his anthology Words Without Pictures, I gave him this.I could say that it wasn't a story about AIDS. But I'd be lying, at least in part. And these days AIDS seems to have become, for good or evil, just another disease in Venus's armory.Really, I think it's mostly about loneliness, and identity, and, perhaps, it's about the joys of making your own way in the world.Vampire SestinaMy only successful sestina (a verse form in which the last word of each of the first six lines repeat in ever-changing sequence over the next verses and in one three-line endpiece). First published in Fantasy Tales and reprinted in Steve Jones's Mammoth Book of Vampires, for years this was my only piece of vampire fiction.MouseThis story was written for the Pete Crowther-edited Touch Wood, an anthology about superstitions. I'd always wanted to write a Raymond Carver short story; he made it look so easy. Writing this story taught me that it wasn't.I'm afraid I actually did hear the radio broadcast mentioned in the text.The Sea ChangeI wrote this in the top flat of a tiny mews house in Earls Court. It was inspired by a Lisa Snellings statue and by the memory of the beach at Portsmouth when I was a boy: the dragging rattle that the sea makes as the waves pull back over the pebbles. I was writing the last part of Sandman at the time, which was called ""The Tempest,"" and bits of Shakespeare's play rattle through this as well, just as it rattled through my head back then.When We Went to See the End of the World by Dawnie Morningside, age 11 ¼Alan Moore (who is one of the finest writers and one of the finest people I know) and I sat down one day in Northampton and began talking about creating a place that we would want to set stories in. This story is set in that place. One day the good burghers and honest townsfolk of Northampton will burn Alan as a warlock, and it will be a great loss to the world.Desert WindOne day a cassette tape arrived from Robin Anders, best known as drummer for Boiled in Lead, with a message, telling me that he wanted me to write something about one of the tracks on the tape. It was called ""Desert Wind."" This is what I wrote.TastingsThis story took me four years to write. Not because I was honing and polishing every adjective, but because I'd get embarrassed. I'd write a paragraph and then I'd leave the story alone until the red flush had faded from my cheeks. And four or five months later I'd go back and write another paragraph. I began writing the story for Ellen Datlow's Off Limits: Tales of Alien Sex, an erotic SF anthology. I missed the deadline for that, carried on writing it for the sequel. Managed about another page or so before I missed the deadline for that as well. Somewhere in there I phoned Ellen Datlow up and warned her that, in the event of my untimely death, there was a half-finished pornographic short story on my hard drive in a file called DATLOW and that it was nothing personal. Two more anthology deadlines came and went, and, four years from the first paragraph, I finished it and Ellen Datlow and her partner in crime Terri Windling took it for Sirens, their collection of erotic fantasy stories.Most of this story came about from wondering why people in fiction never seem to talk while making love or even while having sex. I don't think that it's erotic, but once the story was, finally, finished, I stopped finding it embarrassing.BabycakesA fable, written for a publication to benefit People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). I think it makes its point. It's the only thing I've ever written that has disturbed me. Last year I came downstairs to find my son Michael listening to Warning: Contains Language, my spoken-word CD. ""Babycakes"" started as I arrived, and it caught me by surprise when I heard a voice I scarcely recognized as my own reading this aloud.For the record, I wear a leather jacket and eat meat, but I am quite good with babies.Murder MysteriesWhen I had the idea for this story, it was called ""City of Angels."" But around the time I actually began to write it, a Broadway show with that title appeared, so when the story was finished, I gave it a new name.""Murder Mysteries"" was written for Jessie Horsting at Midnight Graffiti magazine for her paperback anthology, also called, coincidentally, Midnight Graffiti. Pete Atkins, to whom I faxed draft after draft as I wrote and rewrote it, was invaluable as a sounding board and a paragon of patience and good humor.I tried to play fair with the detective part of the story. There are clues everywhere. There's even one in the title.Snow, Glass, ApplesThis is another story that began life in Neil Philip's The Penguin Book of English Folktales. I was reading it in the bath, and I read a story I must have read a thousand times before. (I still have the illustrated version of the story I owned when I was three.) But that thousand and first reading was the charm, and I started to think about the story, all back to front and wrong way around. It sat in my head for a few weeks and then, on a plane, I began to write the story in longhand. When the plane landed, the story was three-quarters done, so I checked into my hotel and sat in a chair in a corner of my room and just kept writing until it was done.It was published by DreamHaven Press in a limited-edition booklet that benefited the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund (an organization that defends the First Amendment rights of comics creators, publishers, and retailers). Poppy Z. Brite reprinted it in her anthology Love in Vein II.I like to think of this story as a virus. Once you've read it, you may never be able to read the original story in the same way again.I'd like to thank Greg Ketter, whose DreamHaven Press published several of these stories in Angels and Visitations, a small-press miscellany of fiction, book reviews, journalism, and stuff I'd written, and who published others as two chapbooks to benefit the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.I want to thank the multitude of editors who commissioned, accepted, and reprinted the various stories in this book, and to all the beta-testers (you know who you are) who put up with my handing them, faxing them or e-mailing them stories, and who read what I sent them and told me, often in no uncertain terms, what needed fixing. To them all, my thanks. Jennifer Hershey shepherded this book from an idea to reality with patience, charm, and editorial wisdom. I cannot thank her enough.Each of these stories is a reflection of or on something and is no more solid than a breath of smoke. They're messages from Looking-Glass Land and pictures in the shifting clouds: smoke, and mirrors, that's all they are. But I enjoyed writing them, and they, in their turn, I like to imagine, appreciate being read.Welcome.-Neil Gaiman,December 1997

CHIVALRY
Mrs. Whitaker found the Holy Grail; it was under a fur coat.Every Thursday afternoon Mrs. Whitaker walked down to the post office to collect her pension, even though her legs were no longer what they were, and on the way back home she would stop in at the Oxfam Shop and buy herself a little something.The Oxfam Shop sold old clothes, knickknacks, oddments, bits and bobs, and large quantities of old paperbacks, all of them donations: secondhand flotsam, often the house clearances of the dead. All the profits went to charity.The shop was staffed by volunteers. The volunteer on duty this afternoon was Marie, seventeen, slightly overweight, and dressed in a baggy mauve jumper that looked like she had bought it from the shop.Marie sat by the till with a copy of Modern Woman magazine, filling out a ""Reveal Your Hidden Personality"" questionnaire. Every now and then, she'd flip to the back of the magazine and check the relative points assigned to an A), B), or C) answer before making up her mind how she'd respond to the question.Mrs. Whitaker puttered around the shop.They still hadn't sold the stuffed cobra, she noted. It had been there for six months now, gathering dust, glass eyes gazing balefully at the clothes racks and the cabinet filled with chipped porcelain and chewed toys.Mrs. Whitaker patted its head as she went past.She picked out a couple of Mills & Boon novels from a bookshelf-Her Thundering Soul and Her Turbulent Heart, a shilling each-and gave careful consideration to the empty bottle of Mateus Rosé with a decorative lampshade on it before deciding she really didn't have anywhere to put it.She moved a rather threadbare fur coat, which smelled badly of mothballs. Underneath it was a walking stick and a water-stained copy of Romance and Legend of Chivalry by A. R. Hope Moncrieff, priced at five pence. Next to the book, on its side, was the Holy Grail. It had a little round paper sticker on the base, and written on it, in felt pen, was the price: 30p.Mrs. Whitaker picked up the dusty silver goblet and appraised it through her thick spectacles.""This is nice,"" she called to Marie.Marie shrugged.""It'd look nice on the mantelpiece.""Marie shrugged again.Mrs. Whitaker gave fifty pence to Marie, who gave her ten pence change and a brown paper bag to put the books and the Holy Grail in. Then she went next door to the butcher's and bought herself a nice piece of liver. Then she went home.The inside of the goblet was thickly coated with a brownish-red dust. Mrs. Whitaker washed it out with great care, then left it to soak for an hour in warm water with a dash of vinegar added.Then she polished it with metal polish until it gleamed, and she put it on the mantelpiece in her parlor, where it sat between a small soulful china basset hound and a photograph of her late husband, Henry, on the beach at Frinton in 1953.She had been right: It did look nice.For dinner that evening she had the liver fried in breadcrumbs with onions. It was very nice.The next morning was Friday; on alternate Fridays Mrs. Whitaker and Mrs. Greenberg would visit each other. Today it was Mrs. Greenberg's turn to visit Mrs. Whitaker. They sat in the parlor and ate macaroons and drank tea. Mrs. Whitaker took one sugar in her tea, but Mrs. Greenberg took sweetener, which she always carried in her handbag in a small plastic container.""That's nice,"" said Mrs. Greenberg, pointing to the Grail. ""What is it?""""It's the Holy Grail,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. ""It's the cup that Jesus drunk out of at the Last Supper. Later, at the Crucifixion, it caught His precious blood when the centurion's spear pierced His side.""Mrs. Greenberg sniffed. She was small and Jewish and didn't hold with unsanitary things. ""I wouldn't know about that,"" she said, ""but it's very nice. Our Myron got one just like that when he won the swimming tournament, only it's got his name on the side.""""Is he still with that nice girl? The hairdresser?""""Bernice? Oh yes. They're thinking of getting engaged,"" said Mrs. Greenberg.""That's nice,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. She took another macaroon.Mrs. Greenberg baked her own macaroons and brought them over every alternate Friday: small sweet light brown biscuits with almonds on top.They talked about Myron and Bernice, and Mrs. Whitaker's nephew Ronald (she had had no children), and about their friend Mrs. Perkins who was in hospital with her hip, poor dear.At midday Mrs. Greenberg went home, and Mrs. Whitaker made herself cheese on toast for lunch, and after lunch Mrs. Whitaker took her pills; the white and the red and two little orange ones.The doorbell rang.Mrs. Whitaker answered the door. It was a young man with shoulder-length hair so fair it was almost white, wearing gleaming silver armor, with a white surcoat.""Hello,"" he said.""Hello,"" said Mrs. Whitaker.""I'm on a quest,"" he said.""That's nice,"" said Mrs. Whitaker, noncommittally.""Can I come in?"" he asked.Mrs. Whitaker shook her head. ""I'm sorry, I don't think so,"" she said.""I'm on a quest for the Holy Grail,"" the young man said. ""Is it here?""""Have you got any identification?"" Mrs. Whitaker asked. She knew that it was unwise to let unidentified strangers into your home when you were elderly and living on your own. Handbags get emptied, and worse than that.The young man went back down the garden path. His horse, a huge gray charger, big as a shire-horse, its head high and its eyes intelligent, was tethered to Mrs. Whitaker's garden gate. The knight fumbled in the saddlebag and returned with a scroll.It was signed by Arthur, King of All Britons, and charged all persons of whatever rank or station to know that here was Galaad, Knight of the Table Round, and that he was on a Right High and Noble Quest. There was a drawing of the young man below that. It wasn't a bad likeness.Mrs. Whitaker nodded. She had been expecting a little card with a photograph on it, but this was far more impressive.""I suppose you had better come in,"" she said.They went into her kitchen. She made Galaad a cup of tea, then she took him into the parlor.Galaad saw the Grail on her mantelpiece, and dropped to one knee. He put down the teacup carefully on the russet carpet. A shaft of light came through the net curtains and painted his awed face with golden sunlight and turned his hair into a silver halo.""It is truly the Sangrail,"" he said, very quietly. He blinked his pale blue eyes three times, very fast, as if he were blinking back tears.He lowered his head as if in silent prayer.Galaad stood up again and turned to Mrs. Whitaker. ""Gracious lady, keeper of the Holy of Holies, let me now depart this place with the Blessed Chalice, that my journeyings may be ended and my geas fulfilled.""""Sorry?"" said Mrs. Whitaker.Galaad walked over to her and took her old hands in his. ""My quest is over,"" he told her. ""The Sangrail is finally within my reach.""Mrs. Whitaker pursed her lips. ""Can you pick your teacup and saucer up, please?"" she said.Galaad picked up his teacup apologetically.""No. I don't think so,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. ""I rather like it there. It's just right, between the dog and the photograph of my Henry.""""Is it gold you need? Is that it? Lady, I can bring you gold . . . """"No,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. ""I don't want any gold thank you. I'm simply not interested.""She ushered Galaad to the front door. ""Nice to meet you,"" she said.His horse was leaning its head over her garden fence, nibbling her gladioli. Several of the neighborhood children were standing on the pavement, watching it.Galaad took some sugar lumps from the saddlebag and showed the braver of the children how to feed the horse, their hands held flat. The children giggled. One of the older girls stroked the horse's nose.Galaad swung himself up onto the horse in one fluid movement. Then the horse and the knight trotted off down Hawthorne Crescent.Mrs. Whitaker watched them until they were out of sight, then sighed and went back inside.The weekend was quiet.On Saturday Mrs. Whitaker took the bus into Maresfield to visit her nephew Ronald, his wife Euphonia, and their daughters, Clarissa and Dillian. She took them a currant cake she had baked herself.On Sunday morning Mrs. Whitaker went to church. Her local church was St. James the Less, which was a little more ""Don't think of this as a church, think of it as a place where like-minded friends hang out and are joyful"" than Mrs. Whitaker felt entirely comfortable with, but she liked the vicar, the Reverend Bartholomew, when he wasn't actually playing the guitar.After the service, she thought about mentioning to him that she had the Holy Grail in her front parlor, but decided against it.On Monday morning Mrs. Whitaker was working in the back garden. She had a small herb garden she was extremely proud of: dill, vervain, mint, rosemary, thyme, and a wild expanse of parsley. She was down on her knees, wearing thick green gardening gloves, weeding, and picking out slugs and putting them in a plastic bag.Mrs. Whitaker was very tenderhearted when it came to slugs. She would take them down to the back of her garden, which bordered on the railway line, and throw them over the fence.She cut some parsley for the salad. There was a cough behind her. Galaad stood there, tall and beautiful, his armor glinting in the morning sun. In his arms he held a long package, wrapped in oiled leather.""I'm back,"" he said.""Hello,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. She stood up, rather slowly, and took off her gardening gloves. ""Well,"" she said, ""now you're here, you might as well make yourself useful.""She gave him the plastic bag full of slugs and told him to tip the slugs out over the back of the fence.He did.Then they went into the kitchen.""Tea? Or lemonade?"" she asked.""Whatever you're having,"" Galaad said.Mrs. Whitaker took a jug of her homemade lemonade from the fridge and sent Galaad outside to pick a sprig of mint. She selected two tall glasses. She washed the mint carefully and put a few leaves in each glass, then poured the lemonade.""Is your horse outside?"" she asked.""Oh yes. His name is Grizzel.""""And you've come a long way, I suppose.""""A very long way.""""I see,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. She took a blue plastic basin from under the sink and half-filled it with water. Galaad took it out to Grizzel. He waited while the horse drank and brought the empty basin back to Mrs. Whitaker.""Now,"" she said, ""I suppose you're still after the Grail.""""Aye, still do I seek the Sangrail,"" he said. He picked up the leather package from the floor, put it down on her tablecloth and unwrapped it. ""For it, I offer you this.""It was a sword, its blade almost four feet long. There were words and symbols traced elegantly along the length of the blade. The hilt was worked in silver and gold, and a large jewel was set in the pommel.""It's very nice,"" said Mrs. Whitaker, doubtfully.""This,"" said Galaad, ""is the sword Balmung, forged by Wayland Smith in the dawn times. Its twin is Flamberge. Who wears it is unconquerable in war, and invincible in battle. Who wears it is incapable of a cowardly act or an ignoble one. Set in its pommel is the sardonynx Bircone, which protects its possessor from poison slipped into wine or ale, and from the treachery of friends.""Mrs. Whitaker peered at the sword. ""It must be very sharp,"" she said, after a while.""It can slice a falling hair in twain. Nay, it could slice a sunbeam,"" said Galaad proudly.""Well, then, maybe you ought to put it away,"" said Mrs. Whitaker.""Don't you want it?"" Galaad seemed disappointed.""No, thank you,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. It occurred to her that her late husband, Henry, would have quite liked it. He would have hung it on the wall in his study next to the stuffed carp he had caught in Scotland, and pointed it out to visitors.Galaad rewrapped the oiled leather around the sword Balmung and tied it up with white cord.He sat there, disconsolate.Mrs. Whitaker made him some cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches for the journey back and wrapped them in greaseproof paper. She gave him an apple for Grizzel. He seemed very pleased with both gifts.She waved them both good-bye.That afternoon she took the bus down to the hospital to see Mrs. Perkins, who was still in with her hip, poor love. Mrs. Whitaker took her some homemade fruitcake, although she had left out the walnuts from the recipe, because Mrs. Perkins's teeth weren't what they used to be.She watched a little television that evening, and had an early night.On Tuesday the postman called. Mrs. Whitaker was up in the boxroom at the top of the house, doing a spot of tidying, and, taking each step slowly and carefully, she didn't make it downstairs in time. The postman had left her a message which said that he'd tried to deliver a packet, but no one was home.Mrs. Whitaker sighed.She put the message into her handbag and went down to the post office.The package was from her niece Shirelle in Sydney, Australia. It contained photographs of her husband, Wallace, and her two daughters. Dixie and Violet, and a conch shell packed in cotton wool.Mrs. Whitaker had a number of ornamental shells in her bedroom. Her favorite had a view of the Bahamas done on it in enamel. It had been a gift from her sister, Ethel, who had died in 1983.She put the shell and the photographs in her shopping bag. Then, seeing that she was in the area, she stopped in at the Oxfam Shop on her way home.""Hullo, Mrs. W.,"" said Marie.Mrs. Whitaker stared at her. Marie was wearing lipstick (possibly not the best shade for her, nor particularly expertly applied, but, thought Mrs. Whitaker, that would come with time) and a rather smart skirt. It was a great improvement.""Oh. Hello, dear,"" said Mrs. Whitaker.""There was a man in here last week, asking about that thing you bought. The little metal cup thing. I told him where to find you. You don't mind, do you?""""No, dear,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. ""He found me.""""He was really dreamy. Really, really dreamy,"" sighed Marie wistfully. ""I could of gone for him.""And he had a big white horse and all,"" Marie concluded. She was standing up straighter as well, Mrs. Whitaker noted approvingly.On the bookshelf Mrs. Whitaker found a new Mills & Boon novel-Her Majestic Passion-although she hadn't yet finished the two she had bought on her last visit.She picked up the copy of Romance and Legend of Chivalry and opened it. It smelled musty. EX LIBRIS FISHER was neatly handwritten at the top of the first page in red ink.She put it down where she had found it.When she got home, Galaad was waiting for her. He was giving the neighborhood children rides on Grizzel's back, up and down the street.""I'm glad you're here,"" she said. ""I've got some cases that need moving.""She showed him up to the boxroom in the top of the house. He moved all the old suitcases for her, so she could get to the cupboard at the back.It was very dusty up there.She kept him up there most of the afternoon, moving things around while she dusted.Galaad had a cut on his cheek, and he held one arm a little stiffly.They talked a little while she dusted and tidied. Mrs. Whitaker told him about her late husband, Henry; and how the life insurance had paid the house off; and how she had all these things, but no one really to leave them to, no one but Ronald really and his wife only liked modern things. She told him how she had met Henry during the war, when he was in the ARP and she hadn't closed the kitchen blackout curtains all the way; and about the sixpenny dances they went to in the town; and how they'd gone to London when the war had ended, and she'd had her first drink of wine.Galaad told Mrs. Whitaker about his mother Elaine, who was flighty and no better than she should have been and something of a witch to boot; and his grandfather, King Pelles, who was well-meaning although at best a little vague; and of his youth in the Castle of Bliant on the Joyous Isle; and his father, whom he knew as ""Le Chevalier Mal Fet,"" who was more or less completely mad, and was in reality Lancelot du Lac, greatest of knights, in disguise and bereft of his wits; and of Galaad's days as a young squire in Camelot.At five o'clock Mrs. Whitaker surveyed the boxroom and decided that it met with her approval; then she opened the window so the room could air, and they went downstairs to the kitchen, where she put on the kettle.Galaad sat down at the kitchen table.He opened the leather purse at his waist and took out a round white stone. It was about the size of a cricket ball.""My lady,"" he said, ""This is for you, an you give me the Sangrail.""Mrs. Whitaker picked up the stone, which was heavier than it looked, and held it up to the light. It was milkily translucent, and deep inside it flecks of silver glittered and glinted in the late-afternoon sunlight. It was warm to the touch.Then, as she held it, a strange feeling crept over her: Deep inside she felt stillness and a sort of peace. Serenity, that was the word for it; she felt serene.Reluctantly she put the stone back on the table.""It's very nice,"" she said.""That is the Philosopher's Stone, which our forefather Noah hung in the Ark to give light when there was no light; it can transform base metals into gold; and it has certain other properties,"" Galaad told her proudly. ""And that isn't all. There's more. Here."" From the leather bag he took an egg and handed it to her.It was the size of a goose egg and was a shiny black color, mottled with scarlet and white. When Mrs. Whitaker touched it, the hairs on the back of her neck prickled. Her immediate impression was one of incredible heat and freedom. She heard the crackling of distant fires, and for a fraction of a second she seemed to feel herself far above the world, swooping and diving on wings of flame.She put the egg down on the table, next to the Philosopher's Stone.""That is the Egg of the Phoenix,"" said Galaad. ""From far Araby it comes. One day it will hatch out into the Phoenix Bird itself; and when its time comes, the bird will build a nest of flame, lay its egg, and die, to be reborn in flame in a later age of the world.""""I thought that was what it was,"" said Mrs. Whitaker.""And, last of all, lady,"" said Galaad, ""I have brought you this.""He drew it from his pouch, and gave it to her. It was an apple, apparently carved from a single ruby, on an amber stem.A little nervously, she picked it up. It was soft to the touch-deceptively so: Her fingers bruised it, and ruby-colored juice from the apple ran down Mrs. Whitaker's hand.The kitchen filled-almost imperceptibly, magically-with the smell of summer fruit, of raspberries and peaches and strawberries and red currants. As if from a great way away she heard distant voices raised in song and far music on the air.""It is one of the apples of the Hesperides,"" said Galaad, quietly. ""One bite from it will heal any illness or wound, no matter how deep; a second bite restores youth and beauty; and a third bite is said to grant eternal life."" Mrs. Whitaker licked the sticky juice from her hand. It tasted like fine wine.There was a moment, then, when it all came back to her-how it was to be young: to have a firm, slim body that would do whatever she wanted it to do; to run down a country lane for the simple unladylike joy of running; to have men smile at her just because she was herself and happy about it.Mrs. Whitaker looked at Sir Galaad, most comely of all knights, sitting fair and noble in her small kitchen.She caught her breath.""And that's all I have brought for you,"" said Galaad. ""They weren't easy to get, either.""Mrs. Whitaker put the ruby fruit down on her kitchen table. She looked at the Philosopher's Stone, and the Egg of the Phoenix, and the Apple of Life.Then she walked into her parlor and looked at the mantelpiece: at the little china basset hound, and the Holy Grail, and the photograph of her late husband Henry, shirtless, smiling and eating an ice cream in black and white, almost forty years away.She went back into the kitchen. The kettle had begun to whistle. She poured a little steaming water into the teapot, swirled it around, and poured it out. Then she added two spoonfuls of tea and one for the pot and poured in the rest of the water. All this she did in silence.She turned to Galaad then, and she looked at him.""Put that apple away,"" she told Galaad, firmly. ""You shouldn't offer things like that to old ladies. It isn't proper.""She paused, then. ""But I'll take the other two,"" she continued, after a moment's thought. ""They'll look nice on the mantelpiece. And two for one's fair, or I don't know what is."" Galaad beamed. He put the ruby apple into his leather pouch. Then he went down on one knee, and kissed Mrs. Whitaker's hand.""Stop that,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. She poured them both cups of tea, after getting out the very best china, which was only for special occasions.They sat in silence, drinking their tea.When they had finished their tea they went into the parlor.Galaad crossed himself, and picked up the Grail.Mrs. Whitaker arranged the Egg and the Stone where the Grail had been. The Egg kept tipping on one side, and she propped it up against the little china dog.""They do look very nice,"" said Mrs. Whitaker.""Yes,"" agreed Galaad. ""They look very nice.""""Can I give you anything to eat before you go back?"" she asked.He shook his head.""Some fruitcake,"" she said. ""You may not think you want any now, but you'll be glad of it in a few hours' time. And you should probably use the facilities. Now, give me that, and I'll wrap it up for you.""She directed him to the small toilet at the end of the hall, and went into the kitchen, holding the Grail. She had some old Christmas wrapping paper in the pantry, and she wrapped the Grail in it, and tied the package with twine. Then she cut a large slice of fruitcake and put it in a brown paper bag, along with a banana and a slice of processed cheese in silver foil.Galaad came back from the toilet. She gave him the paper bag, and the Holy Grail. Then she went up on tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek.""You're a nice boy,"" she said. ""You take care of yourself.""He hugged her, and she shooed him out of the kitchen, and out of the back door, and she shut the door behind him. She poured herself another cup of tea, and cried quietly into a Kleenex, while the sound of hoofbeats echoed down Hawthorne Crescent.On Wednesday Mrs. Whitaker stayed in all day.On Thursday she went down to the post office to collect her pension. Then she stopped in at the Oxfam Shop.The woman on the till was new to her. ""Where's Marie?"" asked Mrs. Whitaker.The woman on the till, who had blue-rinsed gray hair and blue spectacles that went up into diamante points, shook her head and shrugged her shoulders. ""She went off with a young man,"" she said. ""On a horse. Tch. I ask you. I'm meant to be down in the Heathfield shop this afternoon. I had to get my Johnny to run me up here, while we find someone else.""""Oh,"" said Mrs. Whitaker. ""Well, it's nice that she's found herself a young man.""""Nice for her, maybe,"" said the lady on the till, ""But some of us were meant to be in Heathfield this afternoon.""On a shelf near the back of the shop Mrs. Whitaker found a tarnished old silver container with a long spout. It had been priced at sixty pence, according to the little paper label stuck to the side. It looked a little like a flattened, elongated teapot.She picked out a Mills & Boon novel she hadn't read before. It was called Her Singular Love. She took the book and the silver container up to the woman on the till.""Sixty-five pee, dear,"" said the woman, picking up the silver object, staring at it. ""Funny old thing, isn't it? Came in this morning."" It had writing carved along the side in blocky old Chinese characters and an elegant arching handle. ""Some kind of oil can, I suppose.""""No, it's not an oil can,"" said Mrs. Whitaker, who knew exactly what it was. ""It's a lamp."" There was a small metal finger ring, unornamented, tied to the handle of the lamp with brown twine.""Actually,"" said Mrs. Whitaker, ""on second thoughts, I think I'll just have the book.""She paid her five pence for the novel, and put the lamp back where she had found it, in the back of the shop. After all, Mrs. Whitaker reflected, as she walked home, it wasn't as if she had anywhere to put it.

older than sin, and his beard could grow no whiter. He wanted to die.The dwarfish natives of the Arctic caverns did not speak his language, but conversed in their own, twittering tongue, conducted incomprehensible rituals, when they were not actually working in the factories.Once every year they forced him, sobbing and protesting, into Endless Night. During the journey he would stand near every child in the world, leave one of the dwarves' invisible gifts by its bedside. The children slept, frozen into time.He envied Prometheus and Loki, Sisyphus and Judas. His punishment was harsher.Ho.Ho.Ho.

THE PRICE
Tramps and vagabonds have marks they make on gateposts and trees and doors, letting others of their kind know a little about the people who live at the houses and farms they pass on their travels. I think cats must leave similar signs; how else to explain the cats who turn up at our door through the year, hungry and flea-ridden and abandoned?We take them in. We get rid of the fleas and the ticks, feed them, and take them to the vet. We pay for them to get their shots, and, indignity upon indignity, we have them neutered or spayed.And they stay with us: for a few months, or for a year, or for ever.Most of them arrive in summer. We live in the country, just the right distance out of town for the city dwellers to abandon their cats near us.We never seem to have more than eight cats, rarely have less than three. The cat population of my house is currently as follows: Hermione and Pod, tabby and black respectively, the mad sisters who live in my attic office and do not mingle; Snowflake, the blue-eyed long-haired white cat, who lived wild in the woods for years before she gave up her wild ways for soft sofas and beds; and, last but largest, Furball, Snowflake's cushionlike calico long-haired daughter, orange and black and white, whom I discovered as a tiny kitten in our garage one day, strangled and almost dead, her head poked through an old badminton net, and who surprised us all by not dying but instead growing up to be the best-natured cat I have ever encountered.And then there is the black cat. Who has no other name than the Black Cat and who turned up almost a month ago. We did not realize he was going to be living here at first: he looked too well-fed to be a stray, too old and jaunty to have been abandoned. He looked like a small panther, and he moved like a patch of night.One day, in the summer, he was lurking about our ramshackle porch: eight or nine years old, at a guess, male, greenish-yellow of eye, very friendly, quite unperturbable. I assumed he belonged to a neighboring farmer or household.I went away for a few weeks, to finish writing a book, and when I came home he was still on our porch, living in an old cat bed one of the children had found for him. He was, however, almost unrecognizable. Patches of fur had gone, and there were deep scratches on his gray skin. The tip of one ear was chewed away. There was a gash beneath one eye, a slice gone from one lip. He looked tired and thin.We took the Black Cat to the vet, where we got him some antibiotics, which we fed him each night, along with soft cat food.We wondered who he was fighting. Snowflake, our beautiful white near-feral queen? Raccoons? A rat-tailed, fanged possum?Each night the scratches would be worse-one night his side would be chewed up; the next it would be his underbelly, raked with claw marks and bloody to the touch.When it got to that point, I took him down to the basement to recover beside the furnace and the piles of boxes. He was surprisingly heavy, the Black Cat, and I picked him up and carried him down there, with a cat basket, and a litter box, and some food and water. I closed the door behind me. I had to wash the blood from my hands when I left the basement.He stayed down there for four days. At first he seemed too weak to feed himself: a cut beneath one eye had rendered him almost one-eyed, and he limped and lolled weakly, thick yellow pus oozing from the cut in his lip.I went down there every morning and every night, and I fed him and gave him antibiotics, which I mixed with his canned food, and I dabbed at the worst of the cuts, and spoke to him. He had diarrhea, and, although I changed his litter daily, the basement stank evilly.The four days that the Black Cat lived in the basement were a bad four days in my house: the baby slipped in the bath and banged her head and might have drowned; I learned that a project I had set my heart on-adapting Hope Mirrlees's novel Lud in the Mist for the BBC-was no longer going to happen, and I realized that I did not have the energy to begin again from scratch, pitching it to other networks or to other media; my daughter left for summer camp and immediately began to send home a plethora of heart-tearing letters and cards, five or six each day, imploring us to bring her home; my son had some kind of fight with his best friend, to the point that they were no longer on speaking terms; and, returning home one night, my wife hit a deer that ran out in front of the car. The deer was killed, the car was left undriveable, and my wife sustained a small cut over one eye.By the fourth day, the cat was prowling the basement, walking haltingly but impatiently between the stacks of books and comics, the boxes of mail and cassettes, of pictures and of gifts and of stuff. He mewed at me to let him out and, reluctantly, I did so.He went back onto the porch and slept there for the rest of the day.The next morning there were deep new gashes in his flanks, and clumps of black cat hair-his-covered the wooden boards of the porch.Letters arrived that day from my daughter, telling us that camp was going better and she thought she could survive a few days; my son and his friend sorted out their problem, although what the argument was about-trading cards, computer games, Star Wars, or A Girl-I would never learn. The BBC executive who had vetoed Lud in the Mist was discovered to have been taking bribes (well, ""questionable loans"") from an independent production company and was sent home on permanent leave: his successor, I was delighted to learn when she faxed me, was the woman who had initially proposed the project to me before leaving the BBC.I thought about returning the Black Cat to the basement, but decided against it. Instead, I resolved to try and discover what kind of animal was coming to our house each night and from there to formulate a plan of action-to trap it, perhaps.For birthdays and at Christmas, my family gives me gadgets and gizmos, pricy toys which excite my fancy but, ultimately, rarely leave their boxes. There is a food dehydrator and an electric carving knife, a breadmaking machine, and, last year's present, a pair of see-in-the-dark binoculars. On Christmas Day I had put the batteries into the binoculars and had walked about the basement in the dark, too impatient even to wait until nightfall, stalking a flock of imaginary Starlings. (You were warned not to turn it on in the light: that would have damaged the binoculars and quite possibly your eyes as well.) Afterward I had put the device back into its box, and it sat there still, in my office, beside the box of computer cables and forgotten bits and pieces.Perhaps, I thought, if the creature, dog or cat or raccoon or what-have-you, were to see me sitting on the porch, it would not come, so I took a chair into the box-and-coatroom, little larger than a closet, which overlooks the porch, and, when everyone in the house was asleep, I went out onto the porch and bade the Black Cat goodnight.That cat, my wife had said, when he first arrived, is a person. And there was something very personlike in his huge leonine face: his broad black nose, his greenish-yellow eyes, his fanged but amiable mouth (still leaking amber pus from the right lower lip).I stroked his head, and scratched him beneath the chin, and wished him well. Then I went inside and turned off the light on the porch.I sat on my chair in the darkness inside the house with the see-in-the-dark binoculars on my lap. I had switched the binoculars on, and a trickle of greenish light came from the eyepieces.Time passed, in the darkness.I experimented with looking at the darkness with the binoculars, learning to focus, to see the world in shades of green. I found myself horrified by the number of swarming insects I could see in the night air: it was as if the night world were some kind of nightmarish soup, swimming with life. Then I lowered the binoculars from my eyes and stared out at the rich blacks and blues of the night, empty and peaceful and calm.Time passed. I struggled to keep awake, found myself profoundly missing cigarettes and coffee, my two lost addictions. Either of them would have kept my eyes open. But before I had tumbled too far into the world of sleep and dreams, a yowl from the garden jerked me fully awake. I fumbled the binoculars to my eyes and was disappointed to see that it was merely Snowflake, the white cat, streaking across the front garden like a patch of greenish-white light. She vanished into the woodland to the left of the house and was gone.I was about to settle myself back down when it occurred to me to wonder what exactly had startled Snowflake so, and I began scanning the middle distance with the binoculars, looking for a huge raccoon, a dog, or a vicious possum. And there was indeed something coming down the driveway toward the house. I could see it through the binoculars, clear as day.It was the Devil.I had never seen the Devil before, and, although I had written about him in the past, if pressed would have confessed that I had no belief in him, other than as an imaginary figure, tragic and Miltonion. The figure coming up the driveway was not Milton's Lucifer. It was the Devil.My heart began to pound in my chest, to pound so hard that it hurt. I hoped it could not see me, that, in a dark house, behind window glass, I was hidden.The figure flickered and changed as it walked up the drive. One moment it was dark, bull-like, minotaurish, the next it was slim and female, and the next it was a cat itself, a scarred, huge gray-green wildcat, its face contorted with hate.There are steps that lead up to my porch, four white wooden steps in need of a coat of paint (I knew they were white, although they were, like everything else, green through my binoculars). At the bottom of the steps, the Devil stopped and called out something that I could not understand, three, perhaps four words in a whining, howling language that must have been old and forgotten when Babylon was young; and, although I did not understand the words, I felt the hairs raise on the back of my head as it called.And then I heard, muffled through the glass but still audible, a low growl, a challenge, and-slowly, unsteadily-a black figure walked down the steps of the house, away from me, toward the Devil. These days the Black Cat no longer moved like a panther, instead he stumbled and rocked, like a sailor only recently returned to land.The Devil was a woman, now. She said something soothing and gentle to the cat, in a tongue that sounded like French, and reached out a hand to him. He sank his teeth into her arm, and her lip curled, and she spat at him.The woman glanced up at me then, and if I had doubted that she was the Devil before, I was certain of it now: the woman's eyes flashed red fire at me, but you can see no red through the night-vision binoculars, only shades of a green. And the Devil saw me through the window. It saw me. I am in no doubt about that at all.The Devil twisted and writhed, and now it was some kind of jackal, a flat-faced, huge-headed, bull-necked creature, halfway between a hyena and a dingo. There were maggots squirming in its mangy fur, and it began to walk up the steps.The Black Cat leapt upon it, and in seconds they became a rolling, writhing thing, moving faster than my eyes could follow.All this in silence.And then a low roar-down the country road at the bottom of our drive, in the distance, lumbered a late-night truck, its blazing headlights burning bright as green suns through the binoculars. I lowered them from my eyes and saw only darkness, and the gentle yellow of headlights, and then the red of rear lights as it vanished off again into the nowhere at all.When I raised the binoculars once more, there was nothing to be seen. Only the Black Cat on the steps, staring up into the air. I trained the binoculars up and saw something flying away-a vulture, perhaps, or an eagle-and then it flew beyond the trees and was gone.I went out onto the porch, and picked up the Black Cat, and stroked him, and said kind, soothing things to him. He mewled piteously when I first approached him, but, after a while, he went to sleep on my lap, and I put him into his basket, and went upstairs to my bed, to sleep myself. There was dried blood on my T-shirt and jeans, the following morning.That was a week ago.The thing that comes to my house does not come every night. But it comes most nights: we know it by the wounds on the cat, and the pain I can see in those leonine eyes. He has lost the use of his front left paw, and his right eye has closed for good.I wonder what we did to deserve the Black Cat. I wonder who sent him. And, selfish and scared, I wonder how much more he has to give.

TROLL BRIDGE
They pulled up most of the railway tracks in the early sixties, when I was three or four. They slashed the train services to ribbons. This meant that there was nowhere to go but London, and the little town where I lived became the end of the line.My earliest reliable memory: eighteen months old, my mother away in hospital having my sister, and my grandmother walking with me down to a bridge, and lifting me up to watch the train below, panting and steaming like a black iron dragon.Over the next few years they lost the last of the steam trains, and with them went the network of railways that joined village to village, town to town.I didn't know that the trains were going. By the time I was seven they were a thing of the past.We lived in an old house on the outskirts of the town. The fields opposite were empty and fallow. I used to climb the fence and lie in the shade of a small bulrush patch, and read; or if I were feeling more adventurous I'd explore the grounds of the empty manor beyond the fields. It had a weed-clogged ornamental pond, with a low wooden bridge over it. I never saw any groundsmen or caretakers in my forays through the gardens and woods, and I never attempted to enter the manor. That would have been courting disaster, and besides, it was a matter of faith for me that all empty old houses were haunted.It is not that I was credulous, simply that I believed in all things dark and dangerous. It was part of my young creed that the night was full of ghosts and witches, hungry and flapping and dressed completely in black.The converse held reassuringly true: daylight was safe. Daylight was always safe.A ritual: on the last day of the summer school term, walking home from school, I would remove my shoes and socks and, carrying them in my hands, walk down the stony flinty lane on pink and tender feet. During the summer holiday I would put shoes on only under duress. I would revel in my freedom from footwear until the school term began once more in September.When I was seven I discovered the path through the wood. It was summer, hot and bright, and I wandered a long way from home that day.I was exploring. I went past the manor, its windows boarded up and blind, across the grounds, and through some unfamiliar woods. I scrambled down a steep bank, and I found myself on a shady path that was new to me and overgrown with trees; the light that penetrated the leaves was stained green and gold, and I thought I was in fairyland.A little stream trickled down the side of the path, teeming with tiny, transparent shrimps. I picked them up and watched them jerk and spin on my fingertips. Then I put them back.I wandered down the path. It was perfectly straight, and overgrown with short grass. From time to time I would find these really terrific rocks: bubbly, melted things, brown and purple and black. If you held them up to the light you could see every color of the rainbow. I was convinced that they had to be extremely valuable, and stuffed my pockets with them.I walked and walked down the quiet golden-green corridor, and saw nobody.I wasn't hungry or thirsty. I just wondered where the path was going. It traveled in a straight line, and was perfectly flat. The path never changed, but the countryside around it did. At first I was walking along the bottom of a ravine, grassy banks climbing steeply on each side of me. Later, the path was above everything, and as I walked I could look down at the treetops below me, and the roofs of occasional distant houses. My path was always flat and straight, and I walked along it through valleys and plateaus, valleys and plateaus. And eventually, in one of the valleys, I came to the bridge.It was built of clean red brick, a huge curving arch over the path. At the side of the bridge were stone steps cut into the embankment, and, at the top of the steps, a little wooden gate.I was surprised to see any token of the existence of humanity on my path, which I was by now convinced was a natural formation, like a volcano. And, with a sense more of curiosity than anything else (I had, after all, walked hundreds of miles, or so I was convinced, and might be anywhere), I climbed the stone steps, and went through the gate.I was nowhere.The top of the bridge was paved with mud. On each side of it was a meadow. The meadow on my side was a wheatfield; the other field was just grass. There were the caked imprints of huge tractor wheels in the dried mud. I walked across the bridge to be sure: no trip-trap, my bare feet were soundless.Nothing for miles; just fields and wheat and trees.I picked an ear of wheat, and pulled out the sweet grains, peeling them between my fingers, chewing them meditatively.I realized then that I was getting hungry, and went back down the stairs to the abandoned railway track. It was time to go home. I was not lost; all I needed to do was follow my path home once more.There was a troll waiting for me, under the bridge.""I'm a troll,"" he said. Then he paused, and added, more or less as an afterthought, ""Fol rol de ol rol.""He was huge: his head brushed the top of the brick arch. He was more or less translucent: I could see the bricks and trees behind him, dimmed but not lost. He was all my nightmares given flesh. He had huge strong teeth, and rending claws, and strong, hairy hands. His hair was long, like one of my sister's little plastic gonks, and his eyes bulged. He was naked, and his penis hung from the bush of gonk hair between his legs.""I heard you, Jack,"" he whispered in a voice like the wind. ""I heard you trip-trapping over my bridge. And now I'm going to eat your life.""I was only seven, but it was daylight, and I do not remember being scared. It is good for children to find themselves facing the elements of a fairy tale-they are well equipped to deal with these.""Don't eat me,"" I said to the troll. I was wearing a stripy brown T-shirt, and brown corduroy trousers. My hair also was brown, and I was missing a front tooth. I was learning to whistle between my teeth, but wasn't there yet.""I'm going to eat your life, Jack,"" said the troll.I stared the troll in the face. ""My big sister is going to be coming down the path soon,"" I lied, ""and she's far tastier than me. Eat her instead.""The troll sniffed the air, and smiled. ""You're all alone,"" he said. ""There's nothing else on the path. Nothing at all."" Then he leaned down, and ran his fingers over me: it felt like butterflies were brushing my face-like the touch of a blind person. Then he snuffled his fingers, and shook his huge head. ""You don't have a big sister. You've only a younger sister, and she's at her friend's today.""""Can you tell all that from smell?"" I asked, amazed.""Trolls can smell the rainbows, trolls can smell the stars,"" it whispered sadly. ""Trolls can smell the dreams you dreamed before you were ever born. Come close to me and I'll eat your life.""""I've got precious stones in my pocket,"" I told the troll. ""Take them, not me. Look."" I showed him the lava jewel rocks I had found earlier.""Clinker,"" said the troll. ""The discarded refuse of steam trains. Of no value to me.""He opened his mouth wide. Sharp teeth. Breath that smelled of leaf mold and the underneaths of things. ""Eat. Now.""He became more and more solid to me, more and more real; and the world outside became flatter, began to fade.""Wait."" I dug my feet into the damp earth beneath the bridge, wiggled my toes, held on tightly to the real world. I stared into his big eyes. ""You don't want to eat my life. Not yet. I-I'm only seven. I haven't lived at all yet. There are books I haven't read yet. I've never been on an airplane. I can't whistle yet-not really. Why don't you let me go? When I'm older and bigger and more of a meal I'll come back to you."" The troll stared at me with eyes like headlamps.Then it nodded.""When you come back, then,"" it said. And it smiled.I turned around and walked back down the silent straight path where the railway lines had once been.After a while I began to run.I pounded down the track in the green light, puffing and blowing, until I felt a stabbing ache beneath my ribcage, the pain of stitch; and, clutching my side, I stumbled home.The fields started to go, as I grew older. One by one, row by row, houses sprang up with roads named after wildflowers and respectable authors. Our home-an aging, tattered Victorian house-was sold, and torn down; new houses covered the garden.They built houses everywhere.I once got lost in the new housing estate that covered two meadows I had once known every inch of. I didn't mind too much that the fields were going, though. The old manor house was bought by a multinational, and the grounds became more houses.It was eight years before I returned to the old railway line, and when I did, I was not alone.I was fifteen; I'd changed schools twice in that time. Her name was Louise, and she was my first love.I loved her gray eyes, and her fine light brown hair, and her gawky way of walking (like a fawn just learning to walk which sounds really dumb, for which I apologize): I saw her chewing gum, when I was thirteen, and I fell for her like a suicide from a bridge.The main trouble with being in love with Louise was that we were best friends, and we were both going out with other people.I'd never told her I loved her, or even that I fancied her. We were buddies.I'd been at her house that evening: we sat in her room and played Rattus Norvegicus, the first Stranglers LP. It was the beginning of punk, and everything seemed so exciting: the possibilities, in music as in everything else, were endless. Eventually it was time for me to go home, and she decided to accompany me. We held hands, innocently, just pals, and we strolled the ten-minute walk to my house.The moon was bright, and the world was visible and colorless, and the night was warm.We got to my house. Saw the lights inside, and stood in the driveway, and talked about the band I was starting. We didn't go in.Then it was decided that I'd walk her home. So we walked back to her house.She told me about the battles she was having with her younger sister, who was stealing her makeup and perfume. Louise suspected that her sister was having sex with boys. Louise was a virgin. We both were.We stood in the road outside her house, under the sodium yellow streetlight, and we stared at each other's black lips and pale yellow faces.We grinned at each other.Then we just walked, picking quiet roads and empty paths. In one of the new housing estates, a path led us into the woodland, and we followed it.The path was straight and dark, but the lights of distant houses shone like stars on the ground, and the moon gave us enough light to see. Once we were scared, when something snuffled and snorted in front of us. We pressed close, saw it was a badger, laughed and hugged and kept on walking.We talked quiet nonsense about what we dreamed and wanted and thought.And all the time I wanted to kiss her and feel her breasts, and maybe put my hand between her legs.Finally I saw my chance. There was an old brick bridge over the path, and we stopped beneath it. I pressed up against her. Her mouth opened against mine.Then she went cold and stiff, and stopped moving.""Hello,"" said the troll.I let go of Louise. It was dark beneath the bridge, but the shape of the troll filled the darkness.""I froze her,"" said the troll, ""so we can talk. Now: I'm going to eat your life.""My heart pounded, and I could feel myself trembling.""No.""""You said you'd come back to me. And you have. Did you learn to whistle?""""Yes.""""That's good. I never could whistle."" It sniffed, and nodded.""I am pleased. You have grown in life and experience. More to eat. More for me.""I grabbed Louise, a taut zombie, and pushed her forward.""Don't take me. I don't want to die. Take her. I bet she's much tastier than me. And she's two months older than I am. Why don't you take her?"" The troll was silent.It sniffed Louise from toe to head, snuffling at her feet and crotch and breasts and hair.Then it looked at me.""She's an innocent,"" it said. ""You're not. I don't want her. I want you.""I walked to the opening of the bridge and stared up at the stars in the night.""But there's so much I've never done,"" I said, partly to myself.""I mean, I've never. Well, I've never had sex. And I've never been to America. I haven't . . ."" I paused. ""I haven't done anything. Not yet."" The troll said nothing.""I could come back to you. When I'm older."" The troll said nothing.""I will come back. Honest I will.""""Come back to me?"" said Louise. ""Why? Where are you going?""I turned around. The troll had gone, and the girl I had thought I loved was standing in the shadows beneath the bridge.""We're going home,"" I told her. ""Come on.""We walked back and never said anything.She went out with the drummer in the punk band I started, and, much later, married someone else. We met once, on a train, after she was married, and she asked me if I remembered that night.I said I did.""I really liked you, that night, Jack,"" she told me. ""I thought you were going to kiss me. I thought you were going to ask me out. I would have said yes. If you had.""""But I didn't.""""No,"" she said. ""You didn't."" Her hair was cut very short. It didn't suit her.I never saw her again. The trim woman with the taut smile was not the girl I had loved, and talking to her made me feel uncomfortable.I moved to London, and then, some years later, I moved back again, but the town I returned to was not the town I remembered: there were no fields, no farms, no little flint lanes; and I moved away as soon as I could, to a tiny village ten miles down the road.I moved with my family-I was married by now, with a toddler-into an old house that had once, many years before, been a railway station. The tracks had been dug up, and the old couple who lived opposite us used it to grow vegetables.I was getting older. One day I found a gray hair; on another, I heard a recording of myself talking, and I realized I sounded just like my father.I was working in London, doing A&R for one of the major record companies. I was commuting into London by train most days, coming back some evenings.I had to keep a small flat in London; it's hard to commute when the bands you're checking out don't even stagger onto the stage until midnight. It also meant that it was fairly easy to get laid, if I wanted to, which I did.I thought that Eleanora-that was my wife's name; I should have mentioned that before, I suppose-didn't know about the other women; but I got back from a two-week jaunt to New York one winter's day, and when I arrived at the house it was empty and cold.She had left a letter, not a note. Fifteen pages, neatly typed, and every word of it was true. Including the PS, which read: You really don't love me. And you never did.I put on a heavy coat, and I left the house and just walked, stunned and slightly numb.There was no snow on the ground, but there was a hard frost, and the leaves crunched under my feet as I walked. The trees were skeletal black against the harsh gray winter sky.I walked down the side of the road. Cars passed me, traveling to and from London. Once I tripped on a branch, half-hidden in a heap of brown leaves, ripping my trousers, cutting my leg.I reached the next village. There was a river at right angles to the road, and a path I'd never seen before beside it, and I walked down the path, and stared at the partly frozen river. It gurgled and plashed and sang.The path led off through fields; it was straight and grassy.I found a rock, half-buried, on one side of the path. I picked it up, brushed off the mud. It was a melted lump of purplish stuff, with a strange rainbow sheen to it. I put it into the pocket of my coat and held it in my hand as I walked, its presence warm and reassuring.The river meandered away across the fields, and I walked on in silence.I had walked for an hour before I saw houses-new and small and square-on the embankment above me.And then I saw the bridge, and I knew where I was: I was on the old railway path, and I'd been coming down it from the other direction.There were graffiti painted on the side of the bridge: FUCK and BARRY LOVES SUSAN and the omnipresent NF of the National Front.I stood beneath the bridge in the red brick arch, stood among the ice cream wrappers, and the crisp packets and the single, sad, used condom, and watched my breath steam in the cold afternoon air.The blood had dried into my trousers.Cars passed over the bridge above me; I could hear a radio playing loudly in one of them.""Hello?"" I said, quietly, feeling embarrassed, feeling foolish.""Hello?""There was no answer. The wind rustled the crisp packets and the leaves.""I came back. I said I would. And I did. Hello?""Silence.I began to cry then, stupidly, silently, sobbing under the bridge.A hand touched my face, and I looked up.""I didn't think you'd come back,"" said the troll.He was my height now, but otherwise unchanged. His long gonk hair was unkempt and had leaves in it, and his eyes were wide and lonely.I shrugged, then wiped my face with the sleeve of my coat. ""I came back.""Three kids passed above us on the bridge, shouting and running.""I'm a troll,"" whispered the troll, in a small, scared voice. ""Fol rol de ol rol."" He was trembling.I held out my hand and took his huge clawed paw in mine. I smiled at him. ""It's okay,"" I told him. ""Honestly. It's okay.""The troll nodded.He pushed me to the ground, onto the leaves and the wrappers and the condom, and lowered himself on top of me. Then he raised his head, and opened his mouth, and ate my life with his strong sharp teeth.When he was finished, the troll stood up and brushed himself down. He put his hand into the pocket of his coat and pulled out a bubbly, burnt lump of clinker rock.He held it out to me.""This is yours,"" said the troll.I looked at him: wearing my life comfortably, easily, as if he'd been wearing it for years. I took the clinker from his hand, and sniffed it. I could smell the train from which it had fallen, so long ago. I gripped it tightly in my hairy hand.""Thank you,"" I said.""Good luck,"" said the troll.""Yeah. Well. You too."" The troll grinned with my face.It turned its back on me and began to walk back the way I had come, toward the village, back to the empty house I had left that morning; and it whistled as it walked.I've been here ever since. Hiding. Waiting. Part of the bridge. I watch from the shadows as the people pass: walking their dogs, or talking, or doing the things that people do. Sometimes people pause beneath my bridge, to stand, or piss, or make love. And I watch them, but say nothing; and they never see me.Fol rol de ol rol.I'm just going to stay here, in the darkness under the arch. I can hear you all out there, trip-trapping, trip-trapping over my bridge.Oh yes, I can hear you. But I'm not coming out.

DON'T ASK JACK
Nobody knew where the toy had come from, which great-grandparent or distant aunt had owned it before it was given it to the nursery.It was a box, carved and painted in gold and red. It was undoubtedly attractive and, or so the grown-ups maintained, quite valuable-perhaps even an antique. The latch, unfortunately, was rusted shut, and the key had been lost, so the Jack could not be released from his box. Still, it was a remarkable box, heavy and carved and gilt.The children did not play with it. It sat at the bottom of the old wooden toy box, which was the same size and age as a pirate's treasure chest, or so the children thought. The Jack-in-the-Box was buried beneath dolls and trains, clowns and paper stars and old conjuring tricks, and crippled marionettes with their strings irrevocably tangled, with dressing-up clothes (here the tatters of a long-ago wedding dress, there a black silk hat, crusted with age and time) and costume jewelry, broken hoops and tops and hobbyhorses. Under them all was Jack's box.The children did not play with it. They whispered among themselves, alone in the attic nursery. On gray days when the wind howled about the house and rain rattled the slates and pattered down the eaves, they told each other stories about Jack, although they had never seen him. One claimed that Jack was an evil wizard, placed in the box as punishment for crimes too awful to describe; another (I am certain that it must have been one of the girls) maintained that Jack's box was Pandora's Box and he had been placed in the box as guardian to prevent the bad things inside it from coming out once more. They would not even touch the box, if they could help it, although when, as happened from time to time, an adult would comment on the absence of that sweet old Jack-in-the-Box, and retrieve it from the chest, and place it in a position of honor on the mantelpiece, then the children would pluck up their courage and, later, hide it away once more in the darkness.The children did not play with the Jack-in-the-Box. And when they grew up and left the great house, the attic nursery was closed up and almost forgotten.Almost, but not entirely. For each of the children, separately, remembered walking alone in the moon's blue light, on his or her own bare feet, up to the nursery. It was almost like sleepwalking, feet soundless on the wood of the stairs, on the threadbare nursery carpet. Remembered opening the treasure chest, pawing through the dolls and the clothes and pulling out the box.And then the child would touch the catch, and the lid would open, slow as a sunset, and the music would begin to play, and Jack came out. Not with a pop and a bounce: he was no spring-heeled Jack. But deliberately, intently, he would rise from the box and motion to the child to come closer, closer, and smile.And there in the moonlight, he told them each things they could never quite remember, things they were never able entirely to forget.The oldest boy died in the Great War. The youngest, after their parents died, inherited the house, although it was taken from him when he was found in the cellar one night with cloths and paraffin and matches, trying to burn the great house to the ground. They took him to the madhouse, and perhaps he is there still.The other children, who had once been girls and now were women, declined, each and every one, to return to the house in which they had grown up; and the windows of the house were boarded up, and the doors were all locked with huge iron keys, and the sisters visited it as often as they visited their eldest brother's grave, or the sad thing that had once been their younger brother, which is to say, never.Years have passed, and the girls are old women, and owls and bats have made their homes in the old attic nursery, rats build their nests among the forgotten toys. The creatures gaze uncuriously at the faded prints on the wall, and stain the remnants of the carpet with their droppings.And deep within the box within the box, Jack waits and smiles, holding his secrets. He is waiting for the children. He can wait forever.

THE GOLDFISH POOL
AND OTHER STORIES
It was raining when I arrived in L.A., and I felt myself surrounded by a hundred old movies.There was a limo driver in a black uniform waiting for me at the airport, holding a white sheet of cardboard with my name misspelled neatly upon it.""I'm taking you straight to your hotel, sir,"" said the driver. He seemed vaguely disappointed that I didn't have any real luggage for him to carry, just a battered overnight bag stuffed with T-shirts, underwear, and socks.""Is it far?""He shook his head. ""Maybe twenty-five, thirty minutes. You ever been to L.A. before?""""No.""""Well, what I always say, L.A. is a thirty-minute town. Wherever you want to go, it's thirty minutes away. No more.""He hauled my bag into the boot of the car, which he called the trunk, and opened the door for me to climb into the back.""So where you from?"" he asked, as we headed out of the airport into the slick wet neonspattered streets.""England.""""England, eh?""""Yes. Have you ever been there?""""Nosir. I've seen movies. You an actor?""""I'm a writer.""He lost interest. Occasionally he would swear at other drivers, under his breath.He swerved suddenly, changing lanes. We passed a four-car pileup in the lane we had been in.""You get a little rain in this city, all of a sudden everybody forgets how to drive,"" he told me. I burrowed further into the cushions in the back. ""You get rain in England, I hear."" It was a statement, not a question.""A little.""""More than a little. Rains every day in England."" He laughed.""And thick fog. Real thick, thick fog.""""Not really.""""Whaddaya mean, no?"" he asked, puzzled, defensive. ""I've seen movies.""We sat in silence then, driving through the Hollywood rain; but after a while he said: ""Ask them for the room Belushi died in.""""Pardon?""""Belushi. John Belushi. It was your hotel he died in. Drugs. You heard about that?""""Oh. Yes.""""They made a movie about his death. Some fat guy, didn't look nothing like him. But nobody tells the real truth about his death. Y'see, he wasn't alone. There were two other guys with him. Studios didn't want any shit. But you're a limo driver, you hear things.""""Really?""""Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. They were there with him. All of them going doo-doo on the happy dust.""The hotel building was a white mock-gothic chateau. I said good-bye to the chauffeur and checked in; I did not ask about the room in which Belushi had died.I walked out to my chalet through the rain, my overnight bag in my hand, clutching the set of keys that would, the desk clerk told me, get me through the various doors and gates. The air smelled of wet dust and, curiously enough, cough mixture. It was dusk, almost dark.Water splashed everywhere. It ran in rills and rivulets across the courtyard. It ran into a small fishpond that jutted out from the side of a wall in the courtyard.I walked up the stairs into a dank little room. It seemed a poor kind of a place for a star to die.The bed seemed slightly damp, and the rain drummed a maddening beat on the air-conditioning system.I watched a little television-the rerun wasteland: ""Cheers"" segued imperceptibly into ""Taxi,"" which flickered into black and white and became ""I Love Lucy""-then stumbled into sleep.I dreamed of drummers intermittently drumming, only thirty minutes away.The phone woke me. ""Hey-hey-hey-hey. You made it okay then?""""Who is this?""""It's Jacob at the studio. Are we still on for breakfast, hey-hey?""""Breakfast . . . ?""""No problem. I'll pick you up at your hotel in thirty minutes. Reservations are already made. No problems. You got my messages?""""I . . .""""Faxed 'em through last night. See you.""The rain had stopped. The sunshine was warm and bright: proper Hollywood light. I walked up to the main building, walking on a carpet of crushed eucalyptus leaves-the cough medicine smell from the night before.They handed me an envelope with a fax in it-my schedule for the next few days, with messages of encouragement and faxed handwritten doodles in the margin, saying things like 'This is Gonna be a Blockbuster!' and 'Is this Going to be a Great Movie or What!' The fax was signed by Jacob Klein, obviously the voice on the phone. I had never before had any dealings with a Jacob Klein.A small red sports car drew up outside the hotel. The driver got out and waved at me. I walked over. He had a trim, pepper-and-salt beard, a smile that was almost bankable, and a gold chain around his neck. He showed me a copy of Sons of Man.He was Jacob. We shook hands.""Is David around? David Gambol?""David Gambol was the man I'd spoken to earlier on the phone when arranging the trip. He wasn't the producer. I wasn't certain quite what he was. He described himself as ""attached to the project.""""David's not with the studio anymore. I'm kind of running the project now, and I want you to know I'm really psyched. Hey-hey.""""That's good?""We got in the car. ""Where's the meeting?"" I asked.He shook his head. ""It's not a meeting,"" he said. ""It's a breakfast."" I looked puzzled. He took pity on me. ""A kind of pre-meeting meeting,"" he explained.We drove from the hotel to a mall somewhere half an hour away while Jacob told me how much he enjoyed my book and how delighted he was that he'd become attached to the project. He said it was his idea to have me put up in the hotel-""Give you the kind of Hollywood experience you'd never get at the Four Seasons or Ma Maison, right?""-and asked me if I was staying in the chalet in which John Belushi had died. I told him I didn't know, but that I rather doubted it.""You know who he was with, when he died? They covered it up, the studios.""""No. Who?""""Meryl and Dustin.""""This is Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman we're talking about?""""Sure.""""How do you know this?""""People talk. It's Hollywood. You know?""I nodded as if I did know, but I didn't.People talk about books that write themselves, and it's a lie. Books don't write themselves. It takes thought and research and backache and notes and more time and more work than you'd believe.Except for Sons of Man, and that one pretty much wrote itself.The irritating question they ask us-us being writers-is: ""Where do you get your ideas?""And the answer is: Confluence. Things come together. The right ingredients and suddenly: Abracadabra!It began with a documentary on Charles Manson I was watching more or less by accident (it was on a videotape a friend lent me after a couple of things I did want to watch): there was footage of Manson, back when he was first arrested, when people thought he was innocent and that it was the government picking on the hippies. And up on the screen was Manson-a charismatic, good-looking, messianic orator. Someone you'd crawl barefoot into Hell for. Someone you could kill for.The trial started; and, a few weeks into it, the orator was gone, replaced by a shambling, apelike gibberer, with a cross carved into its forehead. Whatever the genius was was no longer there. It was gone. But it had been there.The documentary continued: a hard-eyed ex-con who had been in prison with Manson, explaining, ""Charlie Manson? Listen, Charlie was a joke. He was a nothing. We laughed at him. You know? He was a nothing!""And I nodded. There was a time before Manson was the charisma king, then. I thought of a benediction, something given, that was taken away.I watched the rest of the documentary obsessively. Then, over a black-and-white still, the narrator said something. I rewound, and he said it again.I had an idea. I had a book that wrote itself.The thing the narrator had said was this: that the infant children Manson had fathered on the women of The Family were sent to a variety of children's homes for adoption, with court-given surnames that were certainly not Manson.And I thought of a dozen twenty-five-year-old Mansons. Thought of the charisma-thing descending on all of them at the same time. Twelve young Mansons, in their glory, gradually being pulled toward L.A. from all over the world. And a Manson daughter trying desperately to stop them from coming together and, as the back cover blurb told us, ""realizing their terrifying destiny.""I wrote Sons of Man at white heat: it was finished in a month, and I sent it to my agent, who was surprised by it (""Well, it's not like your other stuff, dear,"" she said helpfully), and she sold it after an auction-my first-for more money than I had thought possible. (My other books, three collections of elegant, allusive and elusive ghost stories, had scarcely paid for the computer on which they were written.)And then it was bought-prepublication-by Hollywood, again after an auction. There were three or four studios interested: I went with the studio who wanted me to write the script. I knew it would never happen, knew they'd never come through. But then the faxes began to spew out of my machine, late at night-most of them enthusiastically signed by one Dave Gambol; one morning I signed five copies of a contract thick as a brick; a few weeks later my agent reported the first check had cleared and tickets to Hollywood had arrived, for ""preliminary talks."" It seemed like a dream.The tickets were business class. It was the moment I saw the tickets were business class that I knew the dream was real.I went to Hollywood in the bubble bit at the top of the jumbo jet, nibbling smoked salmon and holding a hot-off-the-presses hardback of Sons of Man.So. Breakfast.They told me how much they loved the book. I didn't quite catch anybody's name. The men had beards or baseball caps or both; the women were astoundingly attractive, in a sanitary sort of way.Jacob ordered our breakfast, and paid for it. He explained that the meeting coming up was a formality.""It's your book we love,"" he said. ""Why would we have bought your book if we didn't want to make it? Why would we have hired you to write it if we didn't want the specialness you'd bring to the project. The you-ness.""I nodded, very seriously, as if literary me-ness was something I had spent many hours pondering.""An idea like this. A book like this. You're pretty unique.""""One of the uniquest,"" said a woman named Dina or Tina or possibly Deanna.I raised an eyebrow. ""So what am I meant to do at the meeting?""""Be receptive,"" said Jacob. ""Be positive.""The drive to the studio took about half an hour in Jacob's little red car. We drove up to the security gate, where Jacob had an argument with the guard. I gathered that he was new at the studio and had not yet been issued a permanent studio pass.Nor, it appeared, once we got inside, did he have a permanent parking place. I still do not understand the ramifications of this: from what he said, parking places had as much to do with status at the studio as gifts from the emperor determined one's status in the court of ancient China.We drove through the streets of an oddly flat New York and parked in front of a huge old bank.Ten minutes' walk, and I was in a conference room, with Jacob and all the people from breakfast, waiting for someone to come in. In the flurry I'd rather missed who the someone was and what he or she did. I took out my copy of my book and put it in front of me, a talisman of sorts.Someone came in. He was tall, with a pointy nose and a pointy chin, and his hair was too long-he looked like he'd kidnapped someone much younger and stolen their hair. He was an Australian, which surprised me.He sat down. He looked at me.""Shoot,"" he said.I looked at the people from the breakfast, but none of them were looking at me-I couldn't catch anyone's eye. So I began to talk: about the book, about the plot, about the end, the showdown in the L.A. nightclub, where the good Manson girl blows the rest of them up. Or thinks she does. About my idea for having one actor play all the Manson boys.""Do you believe this stuff?"" It was the first question from the Someone.That one was easy. It was one I'd already answered for at least two dozen British journalists.""Do I believe that a supernatural power possessed Charles Manson for a while and is even now possessing his many children? No. Do I believe that something strange was happening? I suppose I must do. Perhaps it was simply that, for a brief while, his madness was in step with the madness of the world outside. I don't know.""""Mm. This Manson kid. He could be Keanu Reaves?""God, no, I thought. Jacob caught my eye and nodded desperately. ""I don't see why not,"" I said. It was all imagination anyway. None of it was real.""We're cutting a deal with his people,"" said the Someone, nodding thoughtfully.They sent me off to do a treatment for them to approve. And by them, I understood they meant the Australian Someone, although I was not entirely sure.Before I left, someone gave me $700 and made me sign for it: two weeks per diem.I spent two days doing the treatment. I kept trying to forget the book, and structure the story as a film. The work went well. I sat in the little room and typed on a notebook computer the studio had sent down for me, and printed out pages on the bubble-jet printer the studio sent down with it. I ate in my room.Each afternoon I would go for a short walk down Sunset Boulevard. I would walk as far as the ""almost all-nite"" bookstore, where I would buy a newspaper. Then I would sit outside in the hotel courtyard for half an hour, reading a newspaper. And then, having had my ration of sun and air, I would go back into the dark, and turn my book back into something else.There was a very old black man, a hotel employee, who would walk across the courtyard each day with almost painful slowness and water the plants and inspect the fish. He'd grin at me as he went past, and I'd nod at him.On the third day I got up and walked over to him as he stood by the fish pool, picking out bits of rubbish by hand: a couple of coins and a cigarette packet.""Hello,"" I said.""Suh,"" said the old man.I thought about asking him not to call me sir, but I couldn't think of a way to put it that might not cause offense. ""Nice fish.""He nodded and grinned. ""Ornamental carp. Brought here all the way from China."" We watched them swim around the little pool.""I wonder if they get bored.""He shook his head. ""My grandson, he's an ichthyologist, you know what that is?""""Studies fishes.""""Uh-huh. He says they only got a memory that's like thirty seconds long. So they swim around the pool, it's always a surprise to them, going 'I never been here before.' They meet another fish they known for a hundred years, they say, 'Who are you, stranger?' """"Will you ask your grandson something for me?"" The old man nodded. ""I read once that carp don't have set life spans. They don't age like we do. They die if they're killed by people or predators or disease, but they don't just get old and die. Theoretically they could live for ever.""He nodded. ""I'll ask him. It sure sounds good. These three-now, this one, I call him Ghost, he's only four, five years old. But the other two, they came here from China back when I was first here.""""And when was that?""""That would have been, in the Year of Our Lord Nineteen Hundred and Twenty-four. How old do I look to you?""I couldn't tell. He might have been carved from old wood. Over fifty and younger than Methuselah. I told him so.""I was born in 1906. God's truth.""""Were you born here, in L.A.?""He shook his head. ""When I was born, Los Angeles wasn't nothin' but an orange grove, a long way from New York."" He sprinkled fish food on the surface of the water. The three fish bobbed up, pale-white silvered ghost carp, staring at us, or seeming to, the O's of their mouths continually opening and closing, as if they were talking to us in some silent, secret language of their own.I pointed to the one he had indicated. ""So he's Ghost, yes?""""He's Ghost. That's right. That one under the lily-you can see his tail, there, see?-he's called Buster, after Buster Keaton. Keaton was staying here when we got the older two. And this one's our Princess.""Princess was the most recognizable of the white carp. She was a pale cream color, with a blotch of vivid crimson along her back, setting her apart from the other two.""She's lovely.""""She surely is. She surely is all of that.""He took a deep breath then and began to cough, a wheezing cough that shook his thin frame. I was able then, for the first time, to see him as a man of ninety.""Are you all right?""He nodded. ""Fine, fine, fine. Old bones,"" he said. ""Old bones.""We shook hands, and I returned to my treatment and the gloom.I printed out the completed treatment, faxed it off to Jacob at the studio.The next day he came over to the chalet. He looked upset.""Everything okay? Is there a problem with the treatment?""""Just shit going down. We made this movie with . . . "" and he named a well-known actress who had been in a few successful films a couple of years before. ""Can't lose, huh? Only she is not as young as she was, and she insists on doing her own nude scenes, and that's not a body anybody wants to see, believe me.""So the plot is, there's this photographer who is persuading women to take their clothes off for him. Then he shtups them. Only no one believes he's doing it. So the chief of police-played by Ms. Lemme Show the World My Naked Butt-realizes that the only way she can arrest him is if she pretends to be one of the women. So she sleeps with him. Now, there's a twist . . . """"She falls in love with him?""""Oh. Yeah. And then she realizes that women will always be imprisoned by male images of women, and to prove her love for him, when the police come to arrest the two of them she sets fire to all the photographs and dies in the fire. Her clothes burn off first. How does that sound to you?""""Dumb.""""That was what we thought when we saw it. So we fired the director and recut it and did an extra day's shoot. Now she's wearing a wire when they make out. And when she starts to fall in love with him, she finds out that he killed her brother. She has a dream in which her clothes burn off, then she goes out with the SWAT team to try to bring him in. But he gets shot by her little sister, who he's also been shtupping.""""Is it any better?""He shakes his head. ""It's junk. If she'd let us use a stand-in for the nude sequences, maybe we'd be in better shape.""What did you think of the treatment?""""What?""""My treatment? The one I sent you?""""Sure. That treatment. We loved it. We all loved it. It was great. Really terrific. We're all really excited.""""So what's next?""""Well, as soon as everyone's had a chance to look it over, we'll get together and talk about it.""He patted me on the back and went away, leaving me with nothing to do in Hollywood.I decided to write a short story. There was an idea I'd had in England before I'd left. Something about a small theater at the end of a pier. Stage magic as the rain came down. An audience who couldn't tell the difference between magic and illusion, and to whom it would make no difference if every illusion was real.That afternoon, on my walk, I bought a couple of books on Stage Magic and Victorian Illusions in the ""almost all-nite"" bookshop. A story, or the seed of it anyway, was there in my head, and I wanted to explore it. I sat on the bench in the courtyard and browsed through the books. There was, I decided, a specific atmosphere that I was after.I was reading about the Pockets Men, who had pockets filled with every small object you could imagine and would produce whatever you asked on request. No illusion-just remarkable feats of organization and memory. A shadow fell across the page. I looked up.""Hullo again,"" I said to the old black man.""Suh,"" he said.""Please don't call me that. It makes me feel like I ought to be wearing a suit or something."" I told him my name.He told me his: ""Pious Dundas.""""Pious?"" I wasn't sure that I'd heard him correctly. He nodded proudly.""Sometimes I am, and sometimes I ain't. It's what my mamma called me, and it's a good name.""""Yes.""""So what are you doing here, suh?""""I'm not sure. I'm meant to be writing a film, I think. Or at least, I'm waiting for them to tell me to start writing a film.""He scratched his nose. ""All the film people stayed here, if I started to tell you them all now, I could talk till a week next Wednesday and I wouldn't have told you the half of them.""""Who were your favorites?""""Harry Langdon. He was a gentleman. George Sanders. He was English, like you. He'd say, 'Ah, Pious. You must pray for my soul.' And I'd say, 'Your soul's your own affair, Mister Sanders,"" but I prayed for him just the same. And June Lincoln.""""June Lincoln?""His eyes sparkled, and he smiled. ""She was the queen of the silver screen. She was finer than any of them: Mary Pickford or Lillian Gish or Theda Bara or Louise Brooks She was the finest. She had 'it.' You know what 'it' was?""""Sex appeal.""""More than that. She was everything you ever dreamed of. You'd see a June Lincoln picture, you wanted to . . ."" he broke off, waved one hand in small circles, as if he were trying to catch the missing words. ""I don't know. Go down on one knee, maybe, like a knight in shinin' armor to the queen. June Lincoln, she was the best of them. I told my grandson about her, he tried to find something for the VCR, but no go. Nothing out there anymore. She only lives in the heads of old men like me."" He tapped his forehead.""She must have been quite something.""He nodded.""What happened to her?""""She hung herself. Some folks said it was because she wouldn't have been able to cut the mustard in the talkies, but that ain't true: she had a voice you'd remember if you heard it just once. Smooth and dark, her voice was, like an Irish coffee. Some say she got her heart broken by a man, or by a woman, or that it was gambling, or gangsters, or booze. Who knows? They were wild days.""""I take it that you must have heard her talk.""He grinned. ""She said, 'Boy, can you find what they did with my wrap?' and when I come back with it, then she said, 'You're a fine one, boy.' And the man who was with her, he said, 'June, don't tease the help' and she smiled at me and gave me five dollars and said 'He don't mind, do you, boy?' and I just shook my head. Then she made the thing with her lips, you know?""""A moue?""""Something like that. I felt it here."" He tapped his chest. ""Those lips. They could take a man apart.""He bit his lower lip for a moment, and focused on forever. I wondered where he was, and when. Then he looked at me once more.""You want to see her lips?""""How do you mean?""""You come over here. Follow me.""""What are we . . . ?"" I had visions of a lip print in cement, like the handprints outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre.He shook his head, and raised an old finger to his mouth. Silence.I closed the books. We walked across the courtyard. When he reached the little fish-pool, he stopped.""Look at the Princess,"" he told me.""The one with the red splotch, yes?""He nodded. The fish reminded me of a Chinese dragon: wise and pale. A ghost fish, white as old bone, save for the blotch of scarlet on its back-an inch-long double-bow shape. It hung in the pool, drifting, thinking.""That's it,"" he said. ""On her back. See?""""I don't quite follow you.""He paused and stared at the fish.""Would you like to sit down?"" I found myself very conscious of Mr. Dundas's age.""They don't pay me to sit down,"" he said, very seriously. Then he said, as if he were explaining something to a small child, ""It was like there were gods in those days. Today, it's all television: small heroes. Little people in the boxes. I see some of them here. Little people.""The stars of the old times: They was giants, painted in silver light, big as houses and when you met them, they were still huge. People believed in them.""They'd have parties here. You worked here, you saw what went on. There was liquor, and weed, and goings-on you'd hardly credit. There was this one party . . . the film was called Hearts of the Desert. You ever heard of it?""I shook my head.""One of the biggest movies of 1926, up there with What Price Glory with Victor McLaglen and Dolores Del Rio and Ella Cinders starring Colleen Moore. You heard of them?""I shook my head again.""You ever heard of Warner Baxter? Belle Bennett?""""Who were they?""""Big, big stars in 1926."" He paused for a moment. ""Hearts of the Desert. They had the party for it here, in the hotel, when it wrapped. There was wine and beer and whiskey and gin-this was Prohibition days, but the studios kind of owned the police force, so they looked the other way; and there was food, and a deal of foolishness; Ronald Colman was there and Douglas Fairbanks-the father, not the son-and all the cast and the crew; and a jazz band played over there where those chalets are now.""And June Lincoln was the toast of Hollywood that night. She was the Arab princess in the film. Those days, Arabs meant passion and lust. These days . . . well, things change.""I don't know what started it all. I heard it was a dare or a bet; maybe she was just drunk. I thought she was drunk. Anyhow, she got up, and the band was playing soft and slow. And she walked over here, where I'm standing right now, and she plunged her hands right into this pool. She was laughing, and laughing, and laughing . . .""Miss Lincoln picked up the fish-reached in and took it, both hands she took it in-and she picked it up from the water, and then she held it in front of her face.""Now, I was worried, because they'd just brought these fish in from China and they cost two hundred dollars apiece. That was before I was looking after the fish, of course. Wasn't me that'd lose it from my wages. But still, two hundred dollars was a whole lot of money in those days.""Then she smiled at all of us, and she leaned down and she kissed it, slow like, on its back. It didn't wriggle or nothin', it just lay in her hand, and she kissed it with her lips like red coral, and the people at the party laughed and cheered.""She put the fish back in the pool, and for a moment it was as if it didn't want to leave her-it stayed by her, nuzzling her fingers. And then the first of the fireworks went off, and it swum away.""Her lipstick was red as red as red, and she left the shape of her lips on the fish's back. -There. Do you see?""Princess, the white carp with the coral red mark on her back, flicked a fin and continued on her eternal series of thirty-second journeys around the pool. The red mark did look like a lip print.He sprinkled a handful of fish food on the water, and the three fish bobbed and gulped to the surface.I walked back in to my chalet, carrying my books on old illusions. The phone was ringing: it was someone from the studio. They wanted to talk about the treatment. A car would be there for me in thirty minutes.""Will Jacob be there?""But the line was already dead.The meeting was with the Australian Someone and his assistant, a bespectacled man in a suit. His was the first suit I'd seen so far, and his spectacles were a vivid blue. He seemed nervous.""Where are you staying?"" asked the Someone.I told him.""Isn't that where Belushi . . . ?""""So I've been told.""He nodded. ""He wasn't alone, when he died.""""No?""He rubbed one finger along the side of his pointy nose. ""There were a couple of other people at the party. They were both directors, both as big as you could get at that point. You don't need names. I found out about it when I was making the last Indiana Jones film.""An uneasy silence. We were at a huge round table, just the three of us, and we each had a copy of the treatment I had written in front of us. Finally I said:""What did you think of it?""They both nodded, more or less in unison.And then they tried, as hard as they could, to tell me they hated it while never saying anything that might conceivably upset me. It was a very odd conversation.""We have a problem with the third act,"" they'd say, implying vaguely that the fault lay neither with me nor with the treatment, nor even with the third act, but with them.They wanted the people to be more sympathetic. They wanted sharp lights and shadows, not shades of gray. They wanted the heroine to be a hero. And I nodded and took notes.At the end of the meeting I shook hands with the Someone, and the assistant in the blue-rimmed spectacles took me off through the corridor maze to find the outside world and my car and my driver.As we walked, I asked if the studio had a picture anywhere of June Lincoln.""Who?"" His name, it turned out, was Greg. He pulled out a small notebook and wrote something down in it with a pencil.""She was a silent screen star. Famous in 1926.""""Was she with the studio?""""I have no idea,"" I admitted. ""But she was famous. Even more famous than Marie Provost.""""Who?"""" 'A winner who became a doggie's dinner.' One of the biggest stars of the silent screen. Died in poverty when the talkies came in and was eaten by her dachshund. Nick Lowe wrote a song about her.""""Who?""""'I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll.' Anyway, June Lincoln. Can someone find me a photo?""He wrote something more down on his pad. Stared at it for a moment. Then wrote down something else. Then he nodded.We had reached the daylight, and my car was waiting.""By the way,"" he said, ""you should know that he's full of shit.""""I'm sorry?""""Full of shit. It wasn't Spielberg and Lucas who were with Belushi. It was Bette Midler and Linda Ronstadt. It was a coke orgy. Everybody knows that. He's full of shit. And he was just a junior studio accountant for chrissakes on the Indiana Jones movie. Like it was his movie. Asshole.""We shook hands. I got in the car and went back to the hotel.The time difference caught up with me that night, and I woke, utterly and irrevocably, at 4 A.M.I got up, peed, then I pulled on a pair of jeans (I sleep in a T-shirt) and walked outside.I wanted to see the stars, but the lights of the city were too bright, the air too dirty. The sky was a dirty, starless yellow, and I thought of all the constellations I could see from the English countryside, and I felt, for the first time, deeply, stupidly homesick.I missed the stars.I wanted to work on the short story or to get on with the film script. Instead, I worked on a second draft of the treatment.I took the number of Junior Mansons down to five from twelve and made it clearer from the start that one of them, who was now male, wasn't a bad guy and the other four most definitely were.They sent over a copy of a film magazine. It had the smell of old pulp paper about it, and was stamped in purple with the studio name and with the word ARCHIVES underneath. The cover showed John Barrymore, on a boat.The article inside was about June Lincoln's death. I found it hard to read and harder still to understand: it hinted at the forbidden vices that led to her death, that much I could tell, but it was as if it were hinting in a cipher to which modern readers lacked any key. Or perhaps, on reflection, the writer of her obituary knew nothing and was hinting into the void.More interesting-at any rate, more comprehensible-were the photos. A full-page, black-edged photo of a woman with huge eyes and a gentle smile, smoking a cigarette (the smoke was airbrushed in, to my way of thinking very clumsily: had people ever been taken in by such clumsy fakes?); another photo of her in a staged clinch with Douglas Fairbanks; a small photograph of her standing on the running board of a car, holding a couple of tiny dogs.She was, from the photographs, not a contemporary beauty. She lacked the transcendence of a Louise Brooks, the sex appeal of a Marilyn Monroe, the sluttish elegance of a Rita Hayworth. She was a twenties starlet as dull as any other twenties starlet. I saw no mystery in her huge eyes, her bobbed hair. She had perfectly made-up cupid's bow lips. I had no idea what she would have looked like if she had been alive and around today.Still, she was real; she had lived. She had been worshipped and adored by the people in the movie palaces. She had kissed the fish, and walked in the grounds of my hotel seventy years before: no time in England, but an eternity in Hollywood.I went in to talk about the treatment. None of the people I had spoken to before were there. Instead, I was shown in to see a very young man in a small office, who never smiled and who told me how much he loved the treatment and how pleased he was that the studio owned the property.He said he thought the character of Charles Manson was particularly cool, and that maybe-""once he was fully dimensionalized""-Manson could be the next Hannibal Lecter.""But. Um. Manson. He's real. He's in prison now. His people killed Sharon Tate.""""Sharon Tate?""""She was an actress. A film star. She was pregnant and they killed her. She was married to Polanski.""""Roman Polanski?""""The director. Yes.""He frowned. ""But we're putting together a deal with Polanski.""""That's good. He's a good director.""""Does he know about this?""""About what? The book? Our film? Sharon Tate's death?"" He shook his head: none of the above. ""It's a three-picture deal. Julia Roberts is semiattached to it. You say Polanski doesn't know about this treatment?""""No, what I said was-""He checked his watch.""Where are you staying?"" he asked. ""Are we putting you up somewhere good?""""Yes, thank you,"" I said. ""I'm a couple of chalets away from the room in which Belushi died.""I expected another confidential couple of stars: to be told that John Belushi had kicked the bucket in company with Julie Andrews and Miss Piggy the Muppet. I was wrong.""Belushi's dead?"" he said, his young brow furrowing. ""Belushi's not dead. We're doing a picture with Belushi.""""This was the brother,"" I told him. ""The brother died, years ago.""He shrugged. ""Sounds like a shithole,"" he said. ""Next time you come out, tell them you want to stay in the Bel Air. You want us to move you out there now?""""No, thank you,"" I said. ""I'm used to it where I am.""""What about the treatment?"" I asked.""Leave it with us.""I found myself becoming fascinated by two old theatrical illusions I found in my books: ""The Artist's Dream"" and ""The Enchanted Casement."" They were metaphors for something, of that I was certain; but the story that ought to have accompanied them was not yet there. I'd write first sentences that did not make it to first paragraphs, first paragraphs that never made it to first pages. I'd write them on the computer, then exit without saving anything.I sat outside in the courtyard and stared at the two white carp and the one scarlet and white carp. They looked, I decided, like Escher drawings of fish, which surprised me, as it had never occurred to me there was anything even slightly realistic in Escher's drawings.Pious Dundas was polishing the leaves of the plants. He had a bottle of polisher and a cloth.""Hi, Pious.""""Suh.""""Lovely day.""He nodded, and coughed, and banged his chest with his fist, and nodded some more.I left the fish, sat down on the bench.""Why haven't they made you retire?"" I asked. ""Shouldn't you have retired fifteen years ago?""He continued polishing. ""Hell no, I'm a landmark. They can say that all the stars in the sky stayed here, but I tell folks what Cary Grant had for breakfast.""""Do you remember?""""Heck no. But they don't know that."" He coughed again. ""What you writing?""""Well, last week I wrote a treatment for this film. And then I wrote another treatment. And now I'm waiting for . . . something.""""So what are you writing?""""A story that won't come right. It's about a Victorian magic trick called 'The Artist's Dream.' An artist comes on to the stage, carrying a big canvas, which he puts on an easel. It's got a painting of a woman on it. And he looks at the painting and despairs of ever being a real painter. Then he sits down and goes to sleep, and the painting comes to life, steps down from the frame and tells him not to give up. To keep fighting. He'll be a great painter one day. She climbs back into the frame. The lights dim. Then he wakes up, and it's a painting again . . ."""". . .and the other illusion,"" I told the woman from the studio, who had made the mistake of feigning interest at the beginning of the meeting, ""was called 'The Enchanted Casement.' A window hangs in the air and faces appear in it, but there's no one around. I think I can get a strange sort of parallel between the enchanted casement and probably television: seems like a natural candidate, after all.""""I like 'Seinfeld,' "" she said. ""You watch that show? It's about nothing. I mean, they have whole episodes about nothing. And I liked Garry Shandling before he did the new show and got mean.""""The illusions,"" I continued, ""like all great illusions, make us question the nature of reality. But they also frame-pun, I suppose, intentionalish-the issue of what entertainment would turn into. Films before they had films, telly before there was ever TV.""She frowned. ""Is this a movie?""""I hope not. It's a short story, if I can get it to work.""""So let's talk about the movie."" She flicked through a pile of notes. She was in her mid-twenties and looked both attractive and sterile. I wondered if she was one of the women who had been at the breakfast on my first day, a Deanna or a Tina.She looked puzzled at something and read: ""I Knew the Bride When She Used to Rock and Roll?""""He wrote that down? That's not this film.""She nodded. ""Now, I have to say that some of your treatmentis kind of . . .contentious. The Manson thing . . .well, we're not sure it's going to fly. Could we take him out?""""But that's the whole point of the thing. I mean, the book is called Sons of Man; it's about Manson's children. If you take him out, you don't have very much, do you? I mean, this is the book you bought."" I held it up for her to see: my talisman. ""Throwing out Manson is like, I don't know, it's like ordering a pizza and then complaining when it arrives because it's flat, round, and covered in tomato sauce and cheese.""She gave no indication of having heard anything I had said. She asked, ""What do you think about When We Were Badd as a title? Two d's in Badd.""""I don't know. For this?""""We don't want people to think that it's religious. Sons of Man. It sounds like it might be kind of anti-Christian.""""Well, I do kind of imply that the power that possesses the Manson children is in some way a kind of demonic power.""""You do?""""In the book.""She managed a pitying look, of the kind that only people who know that books are, at best, properties on which films can be loosely based, can bestow on the rest of us.""Well, I don't think the studio would see that as appropriate,"" she said.""Do you know who June Lincoln was?"" I asked her.She shook her head.""David Gambol? Jacob Klein?""She shook her head once more, a little impatiently. Then she gave me a typed list of things she felt needed fixing, which amounted to pretty much everything. The list was TO: me and a number of other people, whose names I didn't recognize, and it was FROM: Donna Leary.I said Thank you, Donna, and went back to the hotel.I was gloomy for a day. And then I thought of a way to redo the treatment that would, I thought, deal with all of Donna's list of complaints.Another day's thinking, a few days' writing, and I faxed the third treatment off to the studio.Pious Dundas brought his scrapbook over for me to look at, once he felt certain that I was genuinely interested in June Lincoln-named, I discovered, after the month and the President, born Ruth Baumgarten in 1903. It was a leatherbound old scrapbook, the size and weight of a family Bible.She was twenty-four when she died.""I wish you could've seen her,"" said Pious Dundas. ""I wish some of her films had survived. She was so big. She was the greatest star of all of them.""""Was she a good actress?""He shook his head decisively. ""Nope.""""Was she a great beauty? If she was, I just don't see it.""He shook his head again. ""The camera liked her, that's for sure. But that wasn't it. Back row of the chorus had a dozen girls prettier'n her.""""Then what was it?""""She was a star."" He shrugged. ""That's what it means to be a star.""I turned the pages: cuttings, reviewing films I'd never heard of-films for which the only negatives and prints had long ago been lost, mislaid, or destroyed by the fire department, nitrate negatives being a notorious fire hazard; other cuttings from film magazines: June Lincoln at play, June Lincoln at rest, June Lincoln on the set of The Pawnbroker's Shirt, June Lincoln wearing a huge fur coat-which somehow dated the photograph more than the strange bobbed hair or the ubiquitous cigarettes.""Did you love her?""He shook his head. ""Not like you would love a woman . . ."" he said.There was a pause. He reached down and turned the pages.""And my wife would have killed me if she'd heard me say this . . .""Another pause.""But yeah. Skinny dead white woman. I suppose I loved her."" He closed the book.""But she's not dead to you, is she?""He shook his head. Then he went away. But he left me the book to look at.The secret of the illusion of ""The Artist's Dream"" was this: It was done by carrying the girl in, holding tight on to the back of the canvas. The canvas was supported by hidden wires, so, while the artist casually, easily, carried in the canvas and placed it on the easel, he was also carrying in the girl. The painting of the girl on the easel was arranged like a roller blind, and it rolled up or down.""The Enchanted Casement,"" on the other hand, was, literally, done with mirrors: an angled mirror which reflected the faces of people standing out of sight in the wings.Even today many magicians use mirrors in their acts to make you think you are seeing something you are not.It was easy, when you knew how it was done.""Before we start,"" he said, ""I should tell you I don't read treatments. I tend to feel it inhibits my creativity. Don't worry, I had a secretary do a précis, so I'm up to speed.""He had a beard and long hair and looked a little like Jesus, although I doubted that Jesus had such perfect teeth. He was, it appeared, the most important person I'd spoken to so far. His name was John Ray, and even I had heard of him, although I was not entirely sure what he did: his name tended to appear at the beginning of films, next to words like EXECUTIVE PRODUCER. The voice from the studio that had set up the meeting told me that they, the studio, were most excited about the fact that he had ' attached himself to the project.'""Doesn't the précis inhibit your creativity, too?""He grinned. ""Now, we all think you've done an amazing job. Quite stunning. There are just a few things that we have a problem with.""""Such as?""""Well, the Manson thing. And the idea about these kids growing up. So we've been tossing around a few scenarios in the office: try this for size. There's a guy called, say, Jack Badd-two d's, that was Donna's idea-"" Donna bowed her head modestly.""They put him away for satanic abuse, fried him in the chair, and as he dies he swears he'll come back and destroy them all.""Now, it's today, and we see these young boys getting hooked on a video arcade game called Be Badd. His face on it. And as they play the game he like, starts to possess them. Maybe there could be something strange about his face, a Jason or Freddy thing."" He stopped, as if he were seeking approval.So I said, ""So who's making these video games?""He pointed a finger at me and said, ""You're the writer, sweetheart. You want us to do all your work for you?""I didn't say anything. I didn't know what to say.Think movies, I thought. They understand movies. I said, ""But surely, what you're proposing is like doing The Boys from Brazil without Hitler."" He looked puzzled.""It was a film by Ira Levin,"" I said. No flicker of recognition in his eyes. ""Rosemary's Baby."" He continued to look blank. ""Sliver.""He nodded; somewhere a penny had dropped. ""Point taken,"" he said. ""You write the Sharon Stone part, we'll move heaven and earth to get her for you. I have an in to her people.""So I went out.That night it was cold, and it shouldn't have been cold in L.A., and the air smelled more of cough drops than ever.An old girlfriend lived in the L.A. area and I resolved to get hold of her. I phoned the number I had for her and began a quest that took most of the rest of the evening. People gave me numbers, and I rang them, and other people gave me numbers, and I rang them, too.Eventually I phoned a number, and I recognized her voice.""Do you know where I am?"" she said.""No,"" I said. ""I was given this number.""""This is a hospital room,"" she said. ""My mother's. She had a brain hemorrhage.""""I'm sorry. Is she all right?""""No.""""I'm sorry.""There was an awkward silence.""How are you?"" she asked.""Pretty bad,"" I said.I told her everything that had happened to me so far. I told her how I felt.""Why is it like this?"" I asked her.""Because they're scared.""""Why are they scared? What are they scared of?""""Because you're only as good as the last hits you can attach your name to.""""Huh?""""If you say yes to something, the studio may make a film, and it will cost twenty or thirty million dollars, and if it's a failure, you will have your name attached to it and will lose status. If you say no, you don't risk losing status.""""Really?""""Kind of.""""How do you know so much about all this? You're a musician, you're not in films.""She laughed wearily: ""I live out here. Everybody who lives out here knows this stuff. Have you tried asking people about their screenplays?""""No.""""Try it sometime. Ask anyone. The guy in the gas station. Anyone. They've all got them."" Then someone said something to her, and she said something back, and she said, ""Look, I've got to go,"" and she put down the phone.I couldn't find the heater, if the room had a heater, and I was freezing in my little chalet room, like the one Belushi died in, same uninspired framed print on the wall, I had no doubt, same chilly dampness in the air.I ran a hot bath to warm myself up, but I was even chillier when I got out.White goldfish sliding to and fro in the water, dodging and darting through the lily pads. One of the goldfish had a crimson mark on its back that might, conceivably, have been perfectly lip-shaped: the miraculous stigmata of an almost-forgotten goddess. The gray early-morning sky was reflected in the pool.I stared at it gloomily.""You okay?""I turned. Pious Dundas was standing next to me.""You're up early.""""I slept badly. Too cold.""""You should have called the front desk. They'd've sent you down a heater and extra blankets.""""It never occurred to me.""His breathing sounded awkward, labored.""You okay?""""Heck no. I'm old. You get to my age, boy, you won't be okay either. But I'll be here when you've gone. How's work going?""""I don't know. I've stopped working on the treatment, and I'm stuck on 'The Artist's Dream'-this story I'm doing about Victorian stage magic. It's set in an English seaside resort in the rain. With the magician performing magic on the stage, which somehow changes the audience. It touches their hearts.""He nodded, slowly. "" 'The Artist's Dream' . . . "" he said. ""So. You see yourself as the artist or the magician?""""I don't know,"" I said. ""I don't think I'm either of them.""I turned to go and then something occurred to me.""Mister Dundas,"" I said. ""Have you got a screenplay? One you wrote?"" He shook his head.""You never wrote a screenplay?""""Not me,"" he said.""Promise?""He grinned. ""I promise,"" he said.I went back to my room. I thumbed through my U.K. hardback of Sons of Man and wondered that anything so clumsily written had even been published, wondered why Hollywood had bought it in the first place, why they didn't want it, now that they had bought it.I tried to write ""The Artist's Dream"" some more, and failed miserably. The characters were frozen. They seemed unable to breathe, or move, or talk.I went into the toilet, pissed a vivid yellow stream against the porcelain. A cockroach ran across the silver of the mirror.I went back into the sitting room, opened a new document, and wrote: I'm thinking about England in the rain,a strange theatre on the pier: a trailof fear and magic, memory and pain. The fear should be of going bleak insane,the magic should be like a fairytale.I'm thinking about England in the rain. The loneliness is harder to explain-an empty place inside me where I fail,of fear and magic, memory and pain. I think of a magician and a skeinof truth disguised as lies. You wear a veil.I'm thinking about England in the rain . . . The shapes repeat like some bizarre refrainand here's a sword, a hand, and there's a grailof fear and magic, memory and pain. The wizard waves his wand and we turn pale,tells us sad truths, but all to no avail.I'm thinking about England, in the rainof fear and magic, memory and pain. I didn't know if it was any good or not, but that didn't matter. I had written something new and fresh I hadn't written before, and it felt wonderful.I ordered breakfast from room service and requested a heater and a couple of extra blankets.The next day I wrote a six-page treatment for a film called When We Were Badd, in which Jack Badd, a serial killer with a huge cross carved into his forehead, was killed in the electric chair and came back in a video game and took over four young men. The fifth young man defeated Badd by burning the original electric chair, which was now on display, I decided, in the wax museum where the fifth young man's girlfriend worked during the day. By night she was an exotic dancer.The hotel desk faxed it off to the studio, and I went to bed.I went to sleep, hoping that the studio would formally reject it and that I could go home.In the theater of my dreams, a man with a beard and a baseball cap carried on a movie screen, and then he walked off-stage. The silver screen hung in the air, unsupported.A flickery silent film began to play upon it: a woman who came out and stared down at me. It was June Lincoln who flickered on the screen, and it was June Lincoln who walked down from the screen and sat on the edge of my bed.""Are you going to tell me not to give up?"" I asked her.On some level I knew it was a dream. I remember, dimly, understanding why this woman was a star, remember regretting that none of her films had survived.She was indeed beautiful in my dream, despite the livid mark which went all the way around her neck.""Why on earth would I do that?"" she asked. In my dream she smelled of gin and old celluloid, although I do not remember the last dream I had where anyone smelled of anything. She smiled, a perfect black-and-white smile. ""I got out, didn't I?"" Then she stood up and walked around the room.""I can't believe this hotel is still standing,"" she said. ""I used to fuck here."" Her voice was filled with crackles and hisses. She came back to the bed and stared at me, as a cat stares at a hole.""Do you worship me?"" she asked.I shook my head. She walked over to me and took my flesh hand in her silver one.""Nobody remembers anything anymore,"" she said. ""It's a thirty-minute town.""There was something I had to ask her. ""Where are the stars?"" I asked. ""I keep looking up in the sky, but they aren't there.""She pointed at the floor of the chalet. ""You've been looking in the wrong places,"" she said. I had never before noticed that the floor of the chalet was a sidewalk and each paving stone contained a star and a name-names I didn't know: Clara Kimball Young, Linda Arvidson, Vivian Martin, Norma Talmadge, Olive Thomas, Mary Miles Minter, Seena Owen . . .June Lincoln pointed at the chalet window. ""And out there."" The window was open, and through it I could see the whole of Hollywood spread out below me-the view from the hills: an infinite spread of twinkling multicolored lights.""Now, aren't those better than stars?"" she asked.And they were. I realized I could see constellations in the street lamps and the cars.I nodded.Her lips brushed mine.""Don't forget me,"" she whispered, but she whispered it sadly, as if she knew that I would.I woke up with the telephone shrilling. I answered it, growled a mumble into the handpiece.""This is Gerry Quoint, from the studio. We need you for a lunch meeting.Mumble something mumble.""We'll send a car,"" he said. ""The restaurant's about half an hour away.""The restaurant was airy and spacious and green, and they were waiting for me there.By this point I would have been surprised if I had recognized anyone. John Ray, I was told over hors d'oeuvres, had ""split over contract disagreements,"" and Donna had gone with him, ""obviously.""Both of the men had beards; one had bad skin. The woman was thin and seemed pleasant.They asked where I was staying, and, when I told them, one of the beards told us (first making us all agree that this would go no further) that a politician named Gary Hart and one of the Eagles were both doing drugs with Belushi when he died.After that they told me that they were looking forward to the story.I asked the question. ""Is this for Sons of Man or When We Were Badd? Because,"" I told them, ""I have a problem with the latter.""They looked puzzled.It was, they told me, for I Knew the Bride When She Used to Rock and Roll. Which was, they told me, both High Concept and Feel Good. It was also, they added, Very Now, which was important in a town in which an hour ago was Ancient History.They told me that they thought it would be a good thing if our hero could rescue the young lady from her loveless marriage, and if they could rock and roll together at the end.I pointed out that they needed to buy the film rights from Nick Lowe, who wrote the song, and then that, no, I didn't know who his agent was.They grinned and assured me that that wouldn't be a problem.They suggested I turn over the project in my mind before I started on the treatment, and each of them mentioned a couple of young stars to bear in mind when I was putting together the story.And I shook hands with all of them and told them that I certainly would.I mentioned that I thought that I could work on it best back in England.And they said that that would be fine.Some days before, I'd asked Pious Dundas whether anyone was with Belushi in the chalet, on the night that he died.If anyone would know, I figured, he would.""He died alone,"" said Pious Dundas, old as Methuselah, unblinking. ""It don't matter a rat's ass whether there was anyone with him or not. He died alone.""It felt strange to be leaving the hotel.I went up to the front desk.""I'll be checking out later this afternoon.""""Very good, sir.""""Would it be possible for you to . . . the, uh, the groundkeeper. Mister Dundas. An elderly gentleman. I don't know. I haven't seen him around for a couple of days. I wanted to say good-bye.""""To one of the groundsmen?""""Yes.""She stared at me, puzzled. She was very beautiful, and her lipstick was the color of a blackberry bruise. I wondered whether she was waiting to be discovered.She picked up the phone and spoke into it, quietly.Then, ""I'm sorry, sir. Mister Dundas hasn't been in for the last few days.""""Could you give me his phone number?""""I'm sorry, sir. That's not our policy."" She stared at me as she said it, letting me know that she really was so sorry . . .""How's your screenplay?"" I asked her.""How did you know?"" she asked.""Well-""""It's on Joel Silver's desk,"" she said. ""My friend Arnie, he's my writing partner, and he's a courier. He dropped it off with Joel Silver's office, like it came from a regular agent or somewhere.""""Best of luck,"" I told her.""Thanks,"" she said, and smiled with her blackberry lips.Information had two Dundas, P's listed, which I thought was both unlikely and said something about America, or at least Los Angeles.The first turned out to be a Ms. Persephone Dundas. At the second number, when I asked for Pious Dundas, a man's voice said, ""Who is this?"" I told him my name, that I was staying in the hotel, and that I had something belonging to Mr. Dundas.""Mister. My grandfa's dead. He died last night.""Shock makes clichés happen for real: I felt the blood drain from my face; I caught my breath.""I'm sorry. I liked him.""""Yeah.""""It must have been pretty sudden.""""He was old. He got a cough."" Someone asked him who he was talking to, and he said nobody, then he said, ""Thanks for calling.""I felt stunned.""Look, I have his scrapbook. He left it with me.""""That old film stuff?""""Yes.""A pause.""Keep it. That stuff's no good to anybody. Listen, mister, I gotta run."" A click, and the line went silent.I went to pack the scrapbook in my bag and was startled, when a tear splashed on the faded leather cover, to discover that I was crying.I stopped by the pool for the last time, to say good-bye to Pious Dundas, and to Hollywood.Three ghost white carp drifted, fins flicking minutely, through the eternal present of the pool.I remembered their names: Buster, Ghost, and Princess; but there was no longer any way that anyone could have told them apart.The car was waiting for me, by the hotel lobby. It was a thirty-minute drive to the airport, and already I was starting to forget.

THE WHITE ROAD
"". . . I wish that you would visit me one day,in my house.There are such sights I would show you."" My intended lowers her eyes, and, yes, she shivers.Her father and his friends all hoot and cheer. ""That's never a story, Mister Fox,"" chides a pale womanin the corner of the room, her hair corn-fair,her eyes the gray of cloud, meat on her bones,she curves, and smiles crooked and amused. ""Madam, I am no storyteller,"" and I bow, and ask,""Perhaps, you have a story for us?"" I raise an eyebrow.Her smile remains.She nods, then stands, her lips move: ""A girl from the town, a plain girl, was betrayed by her lover,a scholar. So when her blood stopped flowing,and her belly swole beyond disguising,she went to him, and wept hot tears. He stroked her hair,swore that they would marry, that they would run,in the night,together,to his aunt. She believed him;even though she had seen the glances in the hallhe gave to his master's daughter,who was fair, and rich, she believed him.Or she believed that she believed. ""There was something sly about his smile,his eyes so black and sharp, his rufous hair. Somethingthat sent her early to their trysting place,beneath the oak, beside the thornbush,something that made her climb the tree and wait.Climb a tree, and in her condition.Her love arrived at dusk, skulking by owl-light,carrying a bag,from which he took a mattock, shovel, knife.He worked with a will, beside the thornbush,beneath the oaken tree,he whistled gently, and he sang, as he dug her grave,that old song . . .Shall I sing it for you, now, good folk?"" She pauses, and as a one we clap and we holloa-or almost as a one:My intended, her hair so dark, her cheeks so pink,her lips so red,seems distracted.The fair girl (Who is she? A guest of the inn, I hazard) sings: ""A fox went out on a shiny nightAnd he begged for the moon to give him lightFor he'd many miles to go that nightBefore he'd reach his den-O!Den-O! Den-O!He'd many miles to go that night, before he'd reach his den-O."" Her voice is sweet and fine, but the voice of my intended is finer. ""And when her grave was dug-A small hole it was, for she was a little thing,even big with child she was a little thing-he walked below her, back and a forth,rehearsing her hearsing, thus:- Good evening, my pigsnie, my love,my, but you look a treat in the moon's light,mother of my child-to-be. Come, let me hold you.And he'd embrace the midnight air with one hand,and with the other, holding his short but wicked knife,he'd stab and stab the dark. ""She trembled in her oak above him. Breathed so softly,but still she shook. And once he looked up and said,-Owls, I'll wager, and another time, Fie! Is that a catup there? Here, puss . . . But she was still,bethought herself a branch, a leaf, a twig. At dawnhe took his mattock, spade, and knife and leftall grumbling and gudgeoned of his prey. ""They found her later wandering, her witshad left her. There were oak leaves in her hair,and she sang: The bough did bendThe bough did breakI saw the holeThe fox did make We swore to loveWe swore to marryI saw the bladeThe fox did carry ""They say that her babe, when it was born,had a fox's paw on her and not a hand.Fear is the sculptress, midwives claim. The scholar fled."" And she sits down, to general applause.The smile twitches, hides about her lips: I know it's there,it waits in her gray eyes. She stares at me, amused. ""I read that in the Orient foxes follow priests and scholars,in disguise as women, houses, mountains, gods, processions,always discovered by their tails-"" so I begin,but my intended's father intercedes.""Speaking of tales-my dear, you said you had a tale?"" My intended flushes. There are no rose petals,save for her cheeks. She nods and says: ""My story, Father? My story is the story of a dream I dreamed."" Her voice is so quiet and soft, we hush ourselves to hear,outside the inn just the night sounds: An owl hoots,but, as the old folk say, I live too near the woodto be frightened by an owl.She looks at me. ""You, sir. In my dream you rode to me, and called,-Come to my house, my sweet, away down the white road.There are such sights I would show you.I asked how I would find your house, down the white chalk road,for it's a long road, and a dark one, under treesthat make the light all green and gold when the sun is high,but shade the road at other times. At nightit's pitch-black; there is no moonlight on the white road . . . ""And you said, Mister Fox-and this is most curious, but dreamsare treacherous and curious and dark-that you would cut the throat of a sow pig,and you would walk her home behind your fine black stallion.You smiled,smiled, Mister Fox, with your red lips and your green eyes,eyes that could snare a maiden's soul, and your yellow teeth,which could eat her heart-"" ""God forbid,"" I smiled. All eyes were on me then, not her,though hers was the story. Eyes, such eyes. ""So, in my dream, it became my fancy to visit your great house,as you had so often entreated me to do,to walk its glades and paths, to see the pools,the statues you had brought from Greece, the yews,the poplar walk, the grotto, and the bower.And, as this was but a dream, I did not wishto take a chaperone-some withered, juiceless prunewho would not appreciate your house, Mister Fox; whowould not appreciate your pale skin,nor your green eyes,nor your engaging ways. ""So I rode the white chalk road, following the red blood path,on Betsy, my filly. The trees above were green.A dozen miles straight, and then the bloodled me off across meadows, over ditches, down a gravel path  (but now I needed sharp eyes to catch the blood-a drip, a drop: The pig must have been dead as anything),and I reined my filly in front of a house.And such a house. A palladian delight, immense,a landscape of its own, windows, columns,a white stone monument to verticality, expansive. ""There was a sculpture in the garden, before the house,A Spartan child, stolen fox half-concealed in its robe,the fox biting the child's stomach, gnawing the vitals away,the stoic child bravely saying nothing-what could it say, cold marble that it was?There was pain in its eyes, and it stood,upon a plinth on which were carved eight words.I walked around it, and I read:Be bold,be bold,but not too bold. ""I tethered little Betsy in the stables,between a dozen night black stallionseach with blood and madness in his eyes.I saw no one.I walked to the front of the house and up the great steps.The huge doors were locked fast,no servants came to greet me when I knocked.In my dream (for do not forget, Mister Fox, that this wasmy dream. You look so pale) the house fascinated me,the kind of curiosity (you know this,Mister Fox, I see it in your eyes) that killscats. ""I found a door, a small door, off the latch,and pushed my way inside.Walked corridors, lined with oak, with shelves,with busts, with trinkets,I walked, my feet silent on the scarlet carpet,until I reached the great hall.It was there again, in red stones that glittered,set into the white marble of the floor,it said:Be bold,be bold,but not too bold.Or else your life's bloodshall run cold."" ""There were stairs, wide, carpeted in scarlet,off the great hall, and I walked up them, silently, silently.Oak doors: and nowI was in the dining room, or so I am convinced,for the remnants of a grisly supperwere abandoned, cold and fly-buzzed.Here was a half-chewed hand, there, crisped and picked,a face, a woman's face, who must in life, I fear,have looked like me."" ""Heavens defend us all from such dark dreams,"" her father cried.""Can such things be?"" ""It is not so,"" I assured him. The fair woman's smileglittered behind her gray eyes. Peopleneed assurances. ""Beyond the supper room was a room,a huge room, this inn would fit in that room,piled promiscuously with rings and bracelets,necklaces, pearl drops, ball gowns, fur wraps,lace petticoats, silks and satins. Ladies'boots, and muffs, and bonnets: a treasure cave and dressing room-diamonds and rubies underneath my feet. ""Beyond that room I knew myself in Hell.In my dream . . .I saw many heads. The heads of young women. I saw a wallon which dismembered limbs were nailed.A heap of breasts. The piles of guts, of livers, lights,the eyes, the . . .No. I cannot say. And all around the flies were buzzing,onelow droning buzz.-Bëelzebubzebubzebub, they buzzed. I could not breathe,I ran from there and sobbed against a wall."" ""A fox's lair indeed,"" says the fair woman.(""It was not so,"" I mutter.)""They are untidy creatures, so to litterabout their dens the bones and skins and feathersof their prey. The French call him Renard,the Scottish, Tod."" ""One cannot help one's name,"" says my intended's father.He is almost panting now, they all are:in the firelight, the fire's heat, lapping their ale.The wall of the inn was hung with sporting prints. She continues:""From outside I heard a crash and a commotion.I ran back the way I had come, along the red carpet,down the wide staircase-too late!-the main door was opening!I threw myself down the stairs-rolling, tumbling-fetched up hopelessly beneath a table,where I waited, shivered, prayed."" She points at me. ""Yes, you, sir. You came in,crashed open the door, staggered in, you, sir,dragging a young womanby her red hair and by her throat.Her hair was long and unconfined, she screamed and stroveto free herself. You laughed, deep in your throat,were all a-sweat, and grinned from ear to ear."" She glares at me. The color's in her cheeks.""You pulled a short old broadsword, Mister Fox,and as she screamed,you slit her throat, again from ear to ear,I listened to her bubbling, sighing, shriek,and closed my eyes and prayed until she stopped.And after much, much, much too long, she stopped. ""And I looked out. You smiled, held up your sword,your hands agore-blood-"" ""In your dream,"" I tell her. ""In my dream.She lay there on the marble, as you slicedyou hacked, you wrenched, you panted, and you stabbed.You took her head from her shoulders,thrust your tongue between her red wet lips.You cut off her hands. Her pale white hands.You sliced open her bodice, you removed each breast.Then you began to sob and howl.Of a sudden,clutching her head, which you carried by the hair,the flame red hair,you ran up the stairs. ""As soon as you were out of sight,I fled through the open door.I rode my Betsy home, down the white road."" All eyes upon me now. I put down my aleon the old wood of the table.""It is not so,""I told her,told all of them.""It was not so, andGod forbidit should be so. It wasan evil dream. I wish such dreamson no one."" ""Before I fled the charnel house,before I rode poor Betsy into a lather,before we fled down the white road,the blood still red(And was it a pig whose throat you slit, Mister Fox?)before I came to my father's inn,before I fell before them speechless,my father, brothers, friends-"" All honest farmers, fox-hunting men.They are stamping their boots, their black boots. ""-before that, Mister Fox,I seized, from the floor, from the bloody floor,her hand, Mister Fox. The hand of the womanyou hacked apart before my eyes."" ""It is not so-"" ""It was no dream. You Creature. You Bluebeard."" ""It was not so-"" ""You Gilles-de-Rais. You monster."" ""And God forbid it should be so!"" She smiles now, lacking mirth or warmth.The brown hair curls around her fare,roses twining about a bower.Two spots of red are burning on her cheeks. ""Behold, Mister Fox! Her hand! Her poor pale hand!""She pulls it from her breasts (gently freckled,I had dreamed of those breasts),tosses it down upon the table.It lays in front of me.Her father, brothers, friends,they stare at me hungrily,and I pick up the small thing. The hair was red indeed and rank. The pads and clawswere rough. One end was bloody,but the blood had dried. ""This is no hand,"" I tell them. But the firstfist knocks the wind from out of me,an oaken cudgel hits my shoulder,as I stagger,the first black boot kicks me down onto the floor.And then a rain of blows beats down on me,I curl and mewl and pray and grip the pawso tightly. Perhaps I weep. I see her then,the pale fair girl, the smile has reached her lips,her skirts so long as she slips, gray-eyed,amused beyond all bearing, from the room.She'd many a mile to go that night.And as she leaves,from my vantage place upon the floor,I see the brush, the tail between her legs;I would have called,but I could speak no more. Tonight she'll be runningfour-footed, sure-footed, down the white road. What if the hunters come?What if they come? Be bold, I whisper once, before I die. But not too bold . . . And then my tale is done.

QUEEN OF KNIVES
The reappearance of the lady is a matter of individual taste.- WILL GOLDSTON, TRICKS AND ILLUSIONSWhen I was a boy, from time to time,I stayed with my grandparents(old people: I knew they were old-chocolates in their houseremained uneaten until I came to stay,this, then, was aging).My grandfather always made breakfast at sunup:a pot of tea, for her and him and me,some toast and marmalade(the Silver Shred and the Gold). Lunch and dinner,those were my grandmother's to make, the kitchenwas again her domain, all the pans and spoons,the mincer, all the whisks and knives, her loyal subjects.She would prepare the food with them, singing her little songs:Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do,or sometimes,You made me love you, I didn't want to do it,I didn't want to do it.She had no voice, not one to speak of. Business was very slow.My grandfather spent his days at the top of the house,in his tiny darkroom where I was not permitted to go,bringing out paper faces from the darkness,the cheerless smiles of other people's holidays.My grandmother would take me for gray walks along the promenade.Mostly I would explorethe small wet grassy space behind the house,the blackberry brambles, and the garden shed. It was a hard week for my grandparentsforced to entertain a wide-eyed boy-child, soone night they took me to the King's Theatre. The King's . . . Variety!The lights went down, red curtains rose.A popular comedian of the daycame on, stammered out his name (his catchphrase),pulled out a sheet of glass, and stood half-behind it,raising the arm and leg that we could see;reflected,he seemed to fly-it was his trademark,so we all laughed and cheered. He told a joke or two,quite badly. His haplessness, his awkwardness,these were what we had come to see.Bemused and balding and bespectacled,  he reminded me a little of my grandfather. And then the comedian was done.Some ladies danced all legs across the stage.A singer sang a song I didn't know. The audience were old people,like my grandparents, tired and retired,all of them laughing and applauding. In the interval my grandfatherqueued for a choc ice and a couple of tubs.We ate our ices as the lights went down.The SAFETY CURTAIN rose, and then the real curtain. The ladies danced across the stage again,and then the thunder rolled, the smoke went puff,a conjurer appeared and bowed. We clapped. The lady walked on, smiling from the wings:glittered. Shimmered. Smiled.We looked at her, and in that moment flowers grew,and silks and pennants tumbled from his fingertips. The flags of all nations, said my grandfather, nudging me.They were up his sleeve.Since he was a young man(I could not imagine him as a child),my grandfather had been, by his own admission,one of the people who knew how things worked.He had built his own television,my grandmother told me, when they were first married;it was enormous, though the screen was small.This was in the days before television programs;they watched it, though,unsure whether it was people or ghosts they were seeing.He had a patent, too, for something he invented,but it was never manufactured.Stood for the local council, but he came in third.He could repair a shaver or a wireless,develop your film, or build a house for dolls.(The doll's house was my mother's. We still had it at my house;shabby and old, it sat out in the grass, all rained-on and forgot.) The glitter lady wheeled on a box.The box was tall: grown-up-person-sized and black.She opened up the front.They turned it round and banged upon the back.The lady stepped inside, still smiling.The magician closed the door on her.When it was opened, she had gone.He bowed. Mirrors, explained my grandfather. She's really still inside.At a gesture, the box collapsed to matchwood.A trapdoor, assured my grandfather;Grandma hissed him silent. The magician smiled, his teeth were small and crowded;he walked, slowly, out into the audience.He pointed to my grandmother, he bowed.a Middle European bow,and invited her to join him on the stage.The other people clapped and cheered.My grandmother demurred. I was so closeto the magician that I could smell his aftershaveand whispered ""Me, oh, me . . ."" But still,he reached his long fingers for my grandmother. Pearl, go on up, said my grandfather. Go with the man.
 My grandmother must have been, what? Sixty, then?She had just stopped smoking,was trying to lose some weight. She was proudestof her teeth, which, though tobacco-stained, were all her own.My grandfather had lost his, as a youth,riding his bicycle; he had the bright ideato hold on to a bus to pick up speed.The bus had turned,and Grandpa kissed the road.She chewed hard licorice, watching TV at night,or sucked hard caramels, perhaps to make him wrong. She stood up, then, a little slowly.Put down the paper tub half-full of ice cream,the little wooden spoon-went down the aisle, and up the steps.And on the stage. The conjurer applauded her once more-A good sport. That was what she was. A sport.Another glittering woman came from the wings,bringing another box-This one was red. That's her, nodded my grandfather, the onewho vanished off before. You see? That's her.Perhaps it was. All I could seewas a woman who sparkled, standing next to my grandmother(who fiddled with her pearls and looked embarrassed).The lady smiled and faced us, then she froze,a statue, or a window mannequin.The magician pulled the box,with ease,down to the front of stage, where my grandmother waited.A moment or so of chitchat:where she was from, her name, that kind of thing.They'd never met before? She shook her head. The magician opened the door,my grandmother stepped in. Perhaps it's not the same one, admitted my grandfather,on reflection,I think she had darker hair, the other girl.I didn't know.I was proud of my grandmother, but also embarrassed,hoping she'd do nothing to make me squirm,that she wouldn't sing one of her songs. She walked into the box. They shut the door.he opened a compartment at the top, a little door. We sawmy grandmother's face. Pearl? Are you all right, Pearl?My grandmother smiled and nodded.The magician closed the door. The lady gave him a long thin case,so he opened it. Took out a swordand rammed it through the box. And then another, and another,and my grandfather chuckled and explained,The blade slides in the hilt,and then a fake slides out the other side. Then he produced a sheet of metal, whichhe slid into the box half the way up.It cut the thing in half. The two of them,the woman and the man, lifted the tophalf of the box up and off, and put it on the stage,with half my grandma in. The top half. He opened up the little door again, for a moment,My grandmother's face beamed at us, trustingly.When he closed the door before,she went down a trapdoor,and now she's standing halfway up, my grandfather confided.She'll tell us how it's done when it's all over.I wanted him to stop talking: I needed the magic. Two knives now, through the half-a-box,at neck height.Are you there, Pearl? asked the magician. Let us know-do you know any songs? My grandmother sang Daisy, Daisy.He picked up the part of the box,with the little door in it-the head part-and he walked about, and she sangDaisy, Daisy, first at one side of the stage,then at the other. That's him, said my grandfather, and he's throwing his voice.It sounds like Grandma, I said.Of course it does, he said. Of course it does.He's good, he said. He's good. He's very good. The conjuror opened up the box again,now hatbox-sized. My grandmother had finished Daisy, Daisy,and was on a song which went:My my, here we go, the driver's drunk and the horse won't go,now we're going back, now we're going back,back back back to London Town. She had been born in London. Told me ominous talesfrom time to time to timeof her childhood. Of the children who ran into her father's shopshouting Shonky shonky sheeny, running away;she would not let me wear a black shirt because,she said, she remembered the marches through the East End.Moseley's blackshirts. Her sister got an eye blackened. The conjurer took a kitchen knife,pushed it slowly through the red hatbox.And then the singing stopped. He put the boxes back together,pulled out the knives and swords, one by one by one.He opened the compartment in the top: my grandmother smiled,embarrassed, at us, displaying her own old teeth.He closed the compartment, hiding her from view.Pulled out the last knife.Opened the main door again,and she was gone.A gesture, and the red box vanished, too.It's up his sleeve, my grandfather explained, but seemed unsure. The conjurer made two doves fly from a burning plate.A puff of smoke, and he was gone as well. She'll be under the stage now, or backstage,said my grandfather,having a cup of tea. She'll come back to us withflowers, or with chocolates. I hoped for chocolates. The dancing girls again.The comedian, for the last time.And all of them came on together at the end.The grand finale, said my grandfather. Look sharp,perhaps she'll be back on now. But no. They sangwhen you're riding alongon the crest of the waveand the sun is in the sky. The curtain went down, and we shuffled out into the lobby.We loitered for a while.Then we went down to the stage doorand waited for my grandmother to come out.The conjurer came out in street clothes;the glitter woman looked so different in a mac. My grandfather went to speak to him. He shrugged,told us he spoke no English and produceda half-a-crown from behind my ear,and vanished off into the dark and rain. I never saw my grandmother again. We went back to their house, and carried on.My grandfather now had to cook for us.And so for breakfast, dinner, lunch, and tea,we had golden toast and silver marmaladeand cups of tea.'Till I went home. He got so old after that nightas if the years took him all in a rush.Daisy, Daisy, he'd sing, give me your answer, do.If you were the only girl in the world and I were the only boy.My old man said follow the van.My grandfather had the voice in the family,they said he could have been a cantor,but there were snapshots to develop,radios and razors to repair . . .his brothers were a singing duo: the Nightingales,had been on television in the early days. He bore it well. Although, quite late one night,I woke, remembering the licorice sticks in the pantry,I walked downstairs.My grandfather stood there in his bare feet. And, in the kitchen, all alone,I saw him stab a knife into a box.You made me love you.I didn't want to do it.

CHANGES
I.Later, they would point to his sister's death, the cancer that ate her twelve-year-old life, tumors the size of duck eggs in her brain, and him a boy of seven, snot-nosed and crew-cut, watching her die in the white hospital with his wide brown eyes, and they would say, ""That was the start of it all,"" and perhaps it was.In Reboot (dir. Robert Zemeckis, 2018), the biopic, they jump-cut to his teens, and he's watching his science teacher die of AIDS, following their argument over dissecting a large pale-stomached frog.""Why should we take it apart?"" says the young Rajit as the music swells. ""Instead, should we not give it life?"" His teacher, played by the late James Earl Jones, looks shamed and then inspired, and he lifts his hand from his hospital bed to the boy's bony shoulder. ""Well, if anyone can do it, Rajit, you can,"" he says in a deep bass rumble.The boy nods and stares at us with a dedication in his eyes that borders upon fanaticism.This never happened.II.It is a gray November day, and Rajit is now a tall man in his forties with dark-rimmed spectacles, which he is not currently wearing. The lack of spectacles emphasizes his nudity. He is sitting in the bath as the water gets cold, practicing the conclusion to his speech. He stoops a little in everyday life, although he is not stooping now, and he considered his words before he speaks. He is not a good public speaker.The apartment in Brooklyn, which he shares with another research scientist and a librarian, is empty today. His penis is shrunken and nutlike in the tepid water. ""What this means,"" he says loudly and slowly, ""is that the war against cancer has been won.""Then he pauses, takes a question from an imaginary reporter on the other side of the bathroom.""Side effects?"" he replies to himself in an echoing bathroom voice. ""Yes, there are some side effects. But as far as we have been able to ascertain, nothing that will create any permanent changes.""He climbs out of the battered porcelain bathtub and walks, naked, to the toilet bowl, into which he throws up, violently, the stage fright pushing through him like a gutting knife. When there is nothing more to throw up and the dry heaves have subsided, Rajit rinses his mouth with Listerine, gets dressed, and takes the subway into central Manhattan.III.It is, as Time magazine will point out, a discovery that would 'change the nature of medicine every bit as fundamentally and as importantly as the discovery of penicillin.'""What if,"" says Jeff Goldblum, playing the adult Rajit in the biopic, ""just-what if-you could reset the body's genetic code? So many ills come because the body has forgotten what it should be doing. The code has become scrambled. The program has become corrupted. What if . . . what if you could fix it?""""You're crazy,"" retorts his lovely blonde girlfriend, in the movie. In real life he has no girlfriend; in real life Rajit's sex life is a fitful series of commercial transactions between Rajit and the young men of the AAA-Ajax Escort Agency.""Hey,"" says Jeff Goldblum, putting it better than Rajit ever did, ""it's like a computer. Instead of trying to fix the glitches caused by a corrupted program one by one, symptom by symptom, you can just reinstall the program. All the information's there all along. We just have to tell our bodies to go and recheck the RNA and the DNA-reread the program if you will. And then reboot.""The blonde actress smiles, and stops his words with a kiss, amused and impressed and passionate.IV.The woman has cancer of the spleen and of the lymph nodes and abdomen: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She also has pneumonia. She has agreed to Rajit's request to use an experimental treatment on her. She also knows that claiming to cure cancer is illegal in America. She was a fat woman until recently. The weight has fallen from her, and she reminds Rajit of a snowman in the sun: each day she melts, each day she is, he feels, less defined.""It is not a drug as you understand it,"" he tells her. ""It is a set of chemical instructions."" She looks blank. He injects two ampules of a clear liquid into her veins.Soon she sleeps.When she awakes, she is free of cancer. The pneumonia kills her soon after that.Rajit has spent the two days before her death wondering how he will explain the fact that, as the autopsy demonstrates beyond a doubt, the patient now has a penis and is, in every respect, functionally and chromosomally male.V.It is twenty years later in a tiny apartment in New Orleans (although it might as well be in Moscow, or Manchester, or Paris, or Berlin). Tonight is going to be a big night, and Jo/e is going to stun.The choice is between a Polonaise crinoline-style eighteenth-century French court dress (fiberglass bustle, underwired decolletage setting off lace-embroidered crimson bodice) and a reproduction of Sir Phillip Sydney's court dress in black velvet and silver thread, complete with ruff and codpiece. Eventually, and after weighing all the options, Jo/e plumps for cleavage over cock. Twelve hours to go: Jo/e opens the bottle with the red pills, each little red pill marked with an X, and pops two of them. It's 10 A.M., and Jo/e goes to bed, begins to masturbate, penis semihard, but falls asleep before coming.The room is very small. Clothes hang from every surface. An empty pizza box sits on the floor. Jo/e snores loudly, normally, but when freebooting Jo/e makes no sound at all, and might as well be in some kind of coma.Jo/e wakes at 10 P.M., feeling tender and new. Back when Jo/e first started on the party scene, each change would prompt a severe self-examination, peering at moles and nipples, foreskin or clit, finding out which scars had vanished and which ones had remained. But Jo/e's now an old hand at this and puts on the bustle, the petticoat, the bodice and the gown, new breasts (high and conical) pushed together, petticoat trailing the floor, which means Jo/e can wear the forty-year-old pair of Doctor Martens boots underneath (you never know when you'll need to run, or to walk or to kick, and silk slippers do no one any favors).High, powder-look wig completes the look. And a spray of cologne. Then Jo/e's hand fumbles at the petticoat, a finger pushes between the legs (Jo/e wears no knickers, claiming a desire for authenticity to which the Doc Martens give the lie) and then dabs it behind the ears, for luck, perhaps, or to help pull. The taxi rings the door at 11:05, and Jo/e goes downstairs. Jo/e goes to the ball.Tomorrow night Jo/e will take another dose; Jo/e's job identity during the week is strictly male.VI.Rajit never viewed the gender-rewriting action of Reboot as anything more than a side effect. The Nobel prize was for anti-cancer work (rebooting worked for most cancers, it was discovered, but not all of them).For a clever man, Rajit was remarkably shortsighted. There were a few things he failed to foresee. For example:That there would be people who, dying of cancer, would rather die than experience a change in gender.That the Catholic Church would come out against Rajit's chemical trigger, marketed by this point under the brand name Reboot, chiefly because the gender change caused a female body to reabsorb into itself the flesh of a fetus as it rebooted itself: males cannot be pregnant. A number of other religious sects would come out against Reboot, most of them citing Genesis I: 27, ""Male and female created He them,"" as their reason.Sects that came out against Reboot included; Islam; Christian Science; the Russian Orthodox Church; the Roman Catholic Church (with a number of dissenting voices); the Unification Church; Orthodox Trek Fandom; Orthodox Judaism; the Fundamentalist Alliance of the U.S.A.Sects that came out in favor of Reboot use where deemed the appropriate treatment by a qualified medical doctor included: most Buddhists; the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints; the Greek Orthodox Church; the Church of Scientology; the Anglican Church (with a number of dissenting voices); New Trek Fandom; Liberal and Reform Judaism; the New Age Coalition of America.Sects that initially came out in favor of using Reboot recreationally: None.While Rajit realized that Reboot would make gender-reassignment surgery obsolete, it never occurred to him that anyone might wish to take it for reasons of desire or curiosity or escape. Thus, he never foresaw the black market in Reboot and similar chemical triggers; nor that, within fifteen years of Reboot's commercial release and FDA approval, illegal sales of the designer Reboot knock-offs (bootlegs, as they were soon known) would outsell heroin and cocaine, gram for gram, more than ten times over.VII.In several of the New Communist States of Eastern Europe possession of bootlegs carried a mandatory death sentence.In Thailand and Mongolia it was reported that boys were being forcibly rebooted into girls to increase their worth as prostitutes.In China newborn girls were rebooted to boys: families would save all they had for a single dose. The old people died of cancer as before. The subsequent birthrate crisis was not perceived as a problem until it was too late, the proposed drastic solutions proved difficult to implement and led, in their own way, to the final revolution.Amnesty International reported that in several of the Pan-Arabic countries men who could not easily demonstrate that they had been born male and were not, in fact, women escaping the veil were being imprisoned and, in many cases, raped and killed. Most Arab leaders denied that either phenomenon was occurring or had ever occurred.VIII.Rajit is in his sixties when he reads in The New Yorker that the word change is gathering to itself connotations of deep indecency and taboo.Schoolchildren giggle embarrassedly when they encounter phrases like 'I needed a change' or 'Time for change' or 'The Winds of Change' in their studies of pre-twenty-first-century literature. In an English class in Norwich horrified smutty sniggers greet a fourteen-year old's discovery of ""A change is as good as a rest.""A representative of the King's English Society writes a letter to The Times, deploring the loss of another perfectly good word to the English language.Several years later a youth in Streatham is successfully prosecuted for publically wearing a T-shirt with the slogan I'M A CHANGED MAN! printed clearly upon it.IX.Jackie works in Blossoms, a nightclub in West Hollywood. There are dozens, if not hundreds of Jackies in Los Angeles, thousands of them across the country, hundreds of thousands across the world.Some of them work for the government, some for religious organizations, or for businesses. In New York, London, and Los Angeles, people like Jackie are on the door at the places that the in-crowds go.This is what Jackie does. Jackie watches the crowd coming in and thinks, Born M now F, born F now M, born M now M, born M now F, born F now F . . .On ""Natural Nights"" (crudely, unchanged) Jackie says, ""I'm sorry, you can't come in tonight"" a lot. People like Jackie have a 97 percent accuracy rate. An article in Scientific American suggests that birth gender recognition skills might be genetically inherited: an ability that always existed but had no strict survival values until now.Jackie is ambushed in the small hours of the morning, after work, in the back of the Blossoms parking lot. And as each new boot crashes or thuds into Jackie's face and chest and head and groin, Jackie thinks, Born M now F, born F now F, born F now M, born M now M . . .When Jackie gets out of the hospital, vision in one eye only, face and chest a single huge purple-green bruise, there is a message, sent with an enormous bunch of exotic flowers, to say that Jackie's job is still open.However, Jackie takes the bullet train to Chicago, and from there takes a slow train to Kansas City, and stays there, working as a housepainter and electrician, professions for which Jackie had trained a long time before, and does not go back.X.Rajit is now in his seventies. He lives in Rio de Janeiro. He is rich enough to satisfy any whim; he will, however, no longer have sex with anyone. He eyes them all distrustfully from his apartment's window, staring down at the bronzed bodies on the Copacabana, wondering.The people on the beach think no more of him than a teenager with chlamydia gives thanks to Alexander Fleming. Most of them imagine that Rajit must be dead by now. None of them care either way.It is suggested that certain cancers have evolved or mutated to survive rebooting. Many bacterial and viral diseases can survive rebooting. A handful even thrive upon rebooting, and one-a strain of gonorrhea-is hypothesized to use the process in its vectoring, initially remaining dormant in the host body and becoming infectious only when the genitalia have reorganized into that of the opposite gender.Still, the average Western human life span is increasing.Why some freebooters-recreational Reboot users-appear to age normally, while others give no indication of aging at all, is something that puzzles scientists. Some claim that the latter group is actually aging on a cellular level. Others maintain that it is too soon to tell and that no one knows anything for certain.Rebooting does not reverse the aging process; however, there is evidence that, for some, it may arrest it. Many of the older generation, who have until now been resistant to rebooting for pleasure, begin to take it regularly-freebooting-whether they have a medical condition that warrants it or no.XI.Loose coins become known as coinage or, occasionally, specie.The process of making different or altering is now usually known as shifting.XII.Rajit is dying of prostate cancer in his Rio apartment. He is in his early nineties. He has never taken Reboot; the idea now terrifies him. The cancer has spread to the bones of his pelvis and to his testes.He rings the bell. There is a short wait for the nurse's daily soap opera to be turned off, the cup of coffee put down. Eventually his nurse comes in.""Take me out into the air,"" he says to the nurse, his voice hoarse. At first the nurse affects not to understand him. He repeats it, in his rough Portuguese. A shake of the head from his nurse.He pulls himself out of the bed-a shrunken figure, stooped so badly as to be almost hunchbacked, and so frail that it seems that a storm would blow him over-and begins to walk toward the door of the apartment.His nurse tries, and fails, to dissuade him. And then the nurse walks with him to the apartment hall and holds his arm as they wait for the elevator. He has not left the apartment in two years; even before the cancer, Rajit did not leave the apartment. He is almost blind.The nurse walks him out into the blazing sun, across the road, and down onto the sand of the Copacabana.The people on the beach stare at the old man, bald and rotten, in his antique pajamas, gazing about him with colorless once-brown eyes through bottle-thick dark-rimmed spectacles.He stares back at them.They are golden and beautiful. Some of them are asleep on the sand. Most of them are naked, or they wear the kind of bathing attire that emphasizes and punctuates their nakedness.Rajit knows them, then.Later, much later, they made another biopic. In the final sequence the old man falls to his knees on the beach, as he did in real life, and blood trickles from the open flap of his pajama bottoms, soaking the faded cotton and puddling darkly onto the soft sand. He stares at them all, looking from one to another with awe upon his face, like a man who has finally learned how to stare at the sun.He said one word only as he died, surrounded by the golden people, who were not men, who were not women.He said, ""Angels.""And the people watching the biopic, as golden, as beautiful, as changed as the people on the beach, knew that that was the end of it all.And in any way that Rajit would have understood, it was.

THE DAUGHTER OF OWLS
From The Remaines of Gentilisme & Judaisme by John Aubrey, R.S.S. (1686-87), (pp 262-263)I had this story from my friend Edmund Wyld Esq. who had it from Mr Farringdon, who said it was old in his time. In the Town of Dymton a newly-born girl was left one night on the steps of the Church, where the Sexton found her there the next morning, and she had hold of a curious thing, viz.:-ye pellet of an Owle, which when crumbled showed the usual composition of an Hoot-owle's pellet, thus: skin and teeth and small bones.The old wyves of the Town sayed as follows: that the girl was the daughter of Owls, and that she should be burnt to death, for she was not borne of woeman. Notwithstanding, wiser Heads and Greybeards prevayled, and the babe was taken to the Convent (for this was shortly after the Papish times, and the Convent had been left empty, for the Townefolke thought it was a place of Dyvills and such, and Hoot-owles and Screach-owles and many bats did make theyr homes in the tower) and there she was left, and one of the wyves of the Towne each day went to the Convent and fed the babe &c.It was prognostickated that ye babe would dye, wch she did not doe: instead she grew year onn and about until she was a mayd of xiiii summers. She was the prittiest thing you ever did see, a fine young lass, who spent her dais and nights behind high stone walls with no-one never to see, but a Towne wyfe who came every morn. One market daie the good-wife talked too loudly of the girl's prittyness, & also that she could not speak, for she had never learned the manner of it.The men of Dymton, the grey-beards and the young men, spoke to-gether, saying: if wee were to visit her, who would know? (Meaning by visit, that they did intend to ravish her.)It was putt about thus: that ye menfolk would go a-hunting all in a company, when the Moon would be fulle: wch it beeing, they crep't one by one from theyr houses and mett outside the Convent, & the Reeve of Dymton unlocked the gate & one by one they went in. They found her hiding in the cellar, being startled by ye noyse.The Maid was more pritty even than they had heard: her hair was red wch was uncommon, & she wore but a white shift, & when she saw them she was much afrayd for she had never seen no Men before, save only the woemen who brought her vittles: & she stared at them with huge eyes & she uttered small cries, as if she were imploring them nott to hurte her.The Townefolk merely laughed for they meant mischiefe & were wicked cruel men: & they came at her in the moon's light.Then the girl began a-screaching & a-wayling, but that did not stay them from theyr purpos. & the grate window went dark & the light of the moon was blockt: & there was the sound of mighty wings; but the men did not see it as they were intent on theyr ravishment.The folk of Dymton in theyr beds that night dreamed of hoots & screaches and howells: & of grate birds: & they dreamed that they were become littel mice & ratts.On the morrow, when the sun was high, the goodwives of the Town went through Dymton a-hunting High & Low for theyr Husbands & theyr Sonnes; wch, coming to the Convent, they fownd, on the Cellar stones, ye pellets of owles: & in the pellets they discovered hair & buckles & coins, & small bones: & also a quantity of straw upon the floor.And the men of Dymton was none of them seen agane. However, for some years therafter, some said they saw ye Maid in high Places, like the highest Oke trees & steeples &c; this being always in the dusk, and at night, & no-one could rightly sware, if it were her or no.(She was a white figure:-but Mr E. Wyld could not remember him rightly whether folk said that she wore cloathes or was naked.)The truth of it I know not, but it is a merrye tale & one wch I write down here.

SHOGGOTH'S OLD PECULIAR
Benjamin Lassiter was coming to the unavoidable conclusion that the woman who had written A Walking Tour of the British Coastline, the book he was carrying in his backpack, had never been on a walking tour of any kind, and would probably not recognize the British coastline if it were to dance through her bedroom at the head of a marching band, singing ""I'm the British Coastline"" in a loud and cheerful voice while accompanying itself on the kazoo.He had been following her advice for five days now and had little to show for it, except blisters and a backache. All British seaside resorts contain a number of bed-and-breakfast establishments, who will be only too delighted to put you up in the ""off-season."" was one such piece of advice. Ben had crossed it out and written in the margin beside it: All British seaside resorts contain a handful of bed-and-breakfast establishments, the owners of which take off to Spain or Provence or somewhere on the last day of September, locking the doors behind them as they go.He had added a number of other marginal notes, too. Such as Do not repeat not under any circumstances order fried eggs again in any roadside cafe and What is it with the fish-and-chips thing? and No they are not. That last was written beside a paragraph which claimed that, if there was one thing that the inhabitants of scenic villages on the British coastline were pleased to see, it was a young American tourist on a walking tour.For five hellish days, Ben had walked from village to village, had drunk sweet tea and instant coffee in cafeterias and cafes and stared out at gray rocky vistas and at the slate-colored sea, shivered under his two thick sweaters, got wet, and failed to see any of the sights that were promised.Sitting in the bus shelter in which he had unrolled his sleeping bag one night, he had begun to translate key descriptive words: charming he decided, meant nondescript; scenic meant ugly but with a nice view if the rain ever lets up; delightful probably meant We've never been here and don't know anyone who has. He had also come to the conclusion that the more exotic the name of the village, the duller the village.Thus it was that Ben Lassiter came, on the fifth day, somewhere north of Bootle, to the village of Innsmouth, which was rated neither charming, scenic, nor delightful in his guidebook. There were no descriptions of the rusting pier, nor the mounds of rotting lobster pots upon the pebbly beach.On the seafront were three bed-and-breakfasts next to each other: Sea View, Mon Repose, and Shub Niggurath, each with a neon VACANCIES sign turned off in the window of the front parlor, each with a CLOSED FOR THE SEASON notice thumbtacked to the front door.There were no cafes open on the seafront. The lone fish-and-chip shop had a CLOSED sign up. Ben waited outside for it to open as the gray afternoon light faded into dusk. Finally a small, slightly frog-faced woman came down the road, and she unlocked the door of the shop. Ben asked her when they would be open for business, and she looked at him, puzzled, and said, ""It's Monday, dear. We're never open on Monday."" Then she went into the fish-and-chip shop and locked the door behind her, leaving Ben cold and hungry on her doorstep.Ben had been raised in a dry town in northern Texas: the only water was in backyard swimming pools, and the only way to travel was in an air-conditioned pickup truck. So the idea of walking, by the sea, in a country where they spoke English of a sort, had appealed to him. Ben's hometown was double dry: it prided itself on having banned alcohol thirty years before the rest of America leapt onto the Prohibition bandwagon, and on never having got off again; thus all Ben knew of pubs was that they were sinful places, like bars, only with cuter names. The author of A Walking Tour of the British Coastline had, however, suggested that pubs were good places to go to find local color and local information, that one should always ""stand one's round,"" and that some of them sold food.The Innsmouth pub was called The Book of Dead Names and the sign over the door informed Ben that the proprietor was one A. Al-Hazred, licensed to sell wines and spirits. Ben wondered if this meant that they would serve Indian food, which he had eaten on his arrival in Bootle and rather enjoyed. He paused at the signs directing him to the Public Bar or the Saloon Bar, wondering if British Public Bars were private like their Public Schools, and eventually, because it sounded more like something you would find in a Western, going into the Saloon Bar.The Saloon Bar was almost empty. It smelled like last week's spilled beer and the day-before-yesterday's cigarette smoke. Behind the bar was a plump woman with bottle-blonde hair. Sitting in one corner were a couple of gentlemen wearing long gray raincoats and scarves. They were playing dominoes and sipping dark brown foam-topped beerish drinks from dimpled glass tankards.Ben walked over to the bar. ""Do you sell food here?""The barmaid scratched the side of her nose for a moment, then admitted, grudgingly, that she could probably do him a ploughman's.Ben had no idea what this meant and found himself, for the hundredth time, wishing that A Walking Tour of the British Coastline had an American-English phrase book in the back. ""Is that food?"" he asked.She nodded.""Okay. I'll have one of those """"And to drink?""""Coke, please.""""We haven't got any Coke.""""Pepsi, then.""""No Pepsi.""""Well, what do you have? Sprite? 7UP? Gatorade?""She looked blanker than previously. Then she said, ""I think there's a bottle or two of cherryade in the back.""""That'll be fine.""""It'll be five pounds and twenty pence, and I'll bring you over your ploughman's when it's ready.""Ben decided as he sat at a small and slightly sticky wooden table, drinking something fizzy that both looked and tasted a bright chemical red, that a ploughman's was probably a steak of some kind. He reached this conclusion, colored, he knew, by wishful thinking, from imagining rustic, possibly even bucolic, ploughmen leading their plump oxen through fresh-ploughed fields at sunset and because he could, by then, with equanimity and only a little help from others, have eaten an entire ox.""Here you go. Ploughman's,"" said the barmaid, putting a plate down in front of him.That a ploughman's turned out to be a rectangular slab of sharp-tasting cheese, a lettuce leaf, an undersized tomato with a thumbprint in it, a mound of something wet and brown that tasted like sour jam, and a small, hard, stale roll, came as a sad disappointment to Ben, who had already decided that the British treated food as some kind of punishment. He chewed the cheese and the lettuce leaf, and cursed every ploughman in England for choosing to dine upon such swill.The gentlemen in gray raincoats, who had been sitting in the corner, finished their game of dominoes, picked up their drinks, and came and sat beside Ben. ""What you drinkin'?"" one of them asked, curiously.""It's called cherryade,"" he told them. ""It tastes like something from a chemical factory.""""Interesting you should say that,"" said the shorter of the two. ""Interesting you should say that. Because I had a friend worked in a chemical factory and he never drank cherryade."" He paused dramatically and then took a sip of his brown drink. Ben waited for him to go on, but that appeared to be that; the conversation had stopped.In an effort to appear polite, Ben asked, in his turn, ""So, what are you guys drinking?""The taller of the two strangers, who had been looking lugubrious, brightened up. ""Why, that's exceedingly kind of you. Pint of Shoggoth's Old Peculiar for me, please.""""And for me, too,"" said his friend. ""I could murder a Shoggoth's. 'Ere, I bet that would make a good advertising slogan. 'I could murder a Shoggoth's.' I should write to them and suggest it. I bet they'd be very glad of me suggestin' it.""Ben went over to the barmaid, planning to ask her for two pints of Shoggoth's Old Peculiar and a glass of water for himself, only to find she had already poured three pints of the dark beer. Well, he thought, might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, and he was certain it couldn't be worse than the cherryade. He took a sip. The beer had the kind of flavor which, he suspected, advertisers would describe as full-bodied, although if pressed they would have to admit that the body in question had been that of a goat.He paid the barmaid and maneuvered his way back to his new friends.""So. What you doin' in Innsmouth?"" asked the taller of the two. ""I suppose you're one of our American cousins, come to see the most famous of English villages.""""They named the one in America after this one, you know,"" said the smaller one.""Is there an Innsmouth in the States?"" asked Ben.""I should say so,"" said the smaller man. ""He wrote about it all the time. Him whose name we don't mention.""""I'm sorry?"" said Ben.The little man looked over his shoulder, then he hissed, very loudly, ""H. P. Lovecraft!""""I told you not to mention that name,"" said his friend, and he took a sip of the dark brown beer. ""H. P. Lovecraft. H. P. bloody Lovecraft. H. bloody P. bloody Love bloody craft."" He stopped to take a breath. ""What did he know. Eh? I mean, what did he bloody know?""Ben sipped his beer. The name was vaguely familiar; he remembered it from rummaging through the pile of old-style vinyl LPs in the back of his father's garage. ""Weren't they a rock group?""""Wasn't talkin' about any rock group. I mean the writer.""Ben shrugged. ""I've never heard of him,"" he admitted. ""I really mostly only read Westerns. And technical manuals.""The little man nudged his neighbor. ""Here. Wilf. You hear that? He's never heard of him.""""Well. There's no harm in that. I used to read that Zane Grey,"" said the taller.""Yes. Well. That's nothing to be proud of. This bloke-what did you say your name was?""""Ben. Ben Lassiter. And you are . . . ?""The little man smiled; he looked awfully like a frog, thought Ben. ""I'm Seth,"" he said. ""And my friend here is called Wilf.""""Charmed,"" said Wilf.""Hi,"" said Ben.""Frankly,"" said the little man, ""I agree with you.""""You do?"" said Ben, perplexed.The little man nodded. ""Yer. H. P. Lovecraft. I don't know what the fuss is about. He couldn't bloody write."" He slurped his stout, then licked the foam from his lips with a long and flexible tongue. ""I mean, for starters, you look at them words he used. Eldritch. You know what eldritch means?""Ben shook his head. He seemed to be discussing literature with two strangers in an English pub while drinking beer. He wondered for a moment if he had become someone else, while he wasn't looking. The beer tasted less bad, the farther down the glass he went, and was beginning to erase the lingering aftertaste of the cherryade.""Eldritch. Means weird. Peculiar. Bloody odd. That's what it means. I looked it up. In a dictionary. And gibbous?""Ben shook his head again.""Gibbous means the moon was nearly full. And what about that one he was always calling us, eh? Thing. Wossname. Starts with a b. Tip of me tongue . . .""""Bastards?"" suggested Wilf.""Nah. Thing. You know. Batrachian. That's it. Means looked like frogs.""""Hang on,"" said Wilf. ""I thought they was, like, a kind of camel.""Seth shook his head vigorously. ""S'definitely frogs. Not camels. Frogs.""Wilf slurped his Shoggoth's. Ben sipped his, carefully, without pleasure.""So?"" said Ben.""They've got two humps,"" interjected Wilf, the tall one.""Frogs?"" asked Ben.""Nah. Batrachians. Whereas your average dromederary camel, he's only got one. It's for the long journey through the desert. That's what they eat.""""Frogs?"" asked Ben.""Camel humps."" Wilf fixed Ben with one bulging yellow eye. ""You listen to me, matey-me-lad. After you've been out in some trackless desert for three or four weeks, a plate of roasted camel hump starts looking particularly tasty.""Seth looked scornful. ""You've never eaten a camel hump.""""I might have done,"" said Wilf.""Yes, but you haven't. You've never even been in a desert.""""Well, let's say, just supposing I'd been on a pilgrimage to the Tomb of Nyarlathotep . . . """"The black king of the ancients who shall come in the night from the east and you shall not know him, you mean?""""Of course that's who I mean.""""Just checking.""""Stupid question, if you ask me.""""You could of meant someone else with the same name.""""Well, it's not exactly a common name, is it? Nyarlathotep.There's not exactly going to be two of them, are there? ' Hullo, my name's Nyarlathotep, what a coincidence meeting you here, funny them bein' two of us,' I don't exactly think so. Anyway, so I'm trudging through them trackless wastes, thinking to myself, I could murder a camel hump . . . """"But you haven't, have you? You've never been out of Innsmouth harbor.""""Well . . . No.""""There."" Seth looked at Ben triumphantly. Then he leaned over and whispered into Ben's ear, ""He gets like this when he gets a few drinks into him, I'm afraid.""""I heard that,"" said Wilf.""Good,"" said Seth. ""Anyway. H. P. Lovecraft. He'd write one of his bloody sentences. Ahem. 'The gibbous moon hung low over the eldritch and batrachian inhabitants of squamous Dulwich.' What does he mean, eh? What does he mean? I'll tell you what he bloody means. What he bloody means is that the moon was nearly full, and everybody what lived in Dulwich was bloody peculiar frogs. That's what he means.""""What about the other thing you said?"" asked WIlf.""What?""""Squamous. Wossat mean, then?""Seth shrugged. ""Haven't a clue,"" he admitted. ""But he used it an awful lot."" There was another pause.""I'm a student,"" said Ben. ""Gonna be a metallurgist."" Somehow he had managed to finish the whole of his first pint of Shoggoth's Old Peculiar, which was, he realized, pleasantly shocked, his first alcoholic beverage. ""What do you guys do?""""We,"" said Wilf, ""are acolytes.""""Of Great Cthulhu,"" said Seth proudly.""Yeah?"" said Ben. ""And what exactly does that involve?""""My shout,"" said Wilf. ""Hang on."" Wilf went over to the barmaid and came back with three more pints. ""Well,"" he said, ""what it involves is, technically speaking, not a lot right now. The acolytin' is not really what you might call laborious employment in the middle of its busy season. That is, of course, because of his bein' asleep. Well, not exactly asleep. More like, if you want to put a finer point on it, dead."""" 'In his house at Sunken R'lyeh dead Cthulhu lies dreaming,' "" interjected Seth. ""Or, as the poet has it, 'That is not dead what can eternal lie-' """" 'But in Strange Aeons-' "" chanted Wilf.""-and by Strange he means bloody peculiar-""""Exactly. We are not talking your normal Aeons here at all."""" 'But in Strange Aeons even Death can die.' ""Ben was mildly surprised to find that he seemed to be drinking another full-bodied pint of Shoggoth's Old Peculiar. Somehow the taste of rank goat was less offensive on the second pint. He was also delighted to notice that he was no longer hungry, that his blistered feet had stopped hurting, and that his companions were charming, intelligent men whose names he was having difficulty in keeping apart. He did not have enough experience with alcohol to know that this was one of the symptoms of being on your second pint of Shoggoth's Old Peculiar.""So right now,"" said Seth, or possibly Wilf, ""the business is a bit light. Mostly consisting of waiting.""""And praying,"" said Wilf, if he wasn't Seth.""And praying. But pretty soon now, that's all going to change.""""Yeah?"" asked Ben. ""How's that?""""Well,"" confided the taller one. ""Any day now, Great Cthulhu (currently impermanently deceased), who is our boss, will wake up in his undersea living-sort-of quarters.""""And then,"" said the shorter one, ""he will stretch and yawn and get dressed-""""Probably go to the toilet, I wouldn't be at all surprised.""""Maybe read the papers.""""-And having done all that, he will come out of the ocean depths and consume the world utterly.""Ben found this unspeakably funny. ""Like a ploughman's,"" he said.""Exactly. Exactly. Well put, the young American gentleman. Great Cthulhu will gobble the world up like a ploughman's lunch, leaving but only the lump of Branston pickle on the side of the plate.""""That's the brown stuff?"" asked Ben. They assured him that it was, and he went up to the bar and brought them back another three pints of Shoggoth's Old Peculiar.He could not remember much of the conversation that followed. He remembered finishing his pint, and his new friends inviting him on a walking tour of the village, pointing out the various sights to him ""that's where we rent our videos, and that big building next door is the Nameless Temple of Unspeakable Gods and on Saturday mornings there's a jumble sale in the crypt . . . ""He explained to them his theory of the walking tour book and told them, emotionally, that Innsmouth was both scenic and charming. He told them that they were the best friends he had ever had and that Innsmouth was delightful.The moon was nearly full, and in the pale moonlight both of his new friends did look remarkably like huge frogs. Or possibly camels.The three of them walked to the end of the rusted pier, and Seth and/or Wilf pointed out to Ben the ruins of Sunken R'lyeh in the bay, visible in the moonlight, beneath the sea, and Ben was overcome by what he kept explaining was a sudden and unforeseen attack of seasickness and was violently and unendingly sick over the metal railings into the black sea below . . .After that it all got a bit odd.Ben Lassiter awoke on the cold hillside with his head pounding and a bad taste in his mouth. His head was resting on his backpack. There was rocky moorland on each side of him, and no sign of a road, and no sign of any village, scenic, charming, delightful, or even picturesque.He stumbled and limped almost a mile to the nearest road and walked along it until he reached a petrol station.They told him that there was no village anywhere locally named Innsmouth. No village with a pub called The Book of Dead Names. He told them about two men, named Wilf and Seth, and a friend of theirs, called Strange Ian, who was fast asleep somewhere, if he wasn't dead, under the sea. They told him that they didn't think much of American hippies who wandered about the countryside taking drugs, and that he'd probably feel better after a nice cup of tea and a tuna and cucumber sandwich, but that if he was dead set on wandering the country taking drugs, young Ernie who worked the afternoon shift would be all too happy to sell him a nice little bag of homegrown cannabis, if he could come back after lunch.Ben pulled out his A Walking Tour of the British Coastline book and tried to find Innsmouth in it to prove to them that he had not dreamed it, but he was unable to locate the page it had been on-if ever it had been there at all. Most of one page, however, had been ripped out, roughly, about halfway through the book.And then Ben telephoned a taxi, which took him to Bootle railway station, where he caught a train, which took him to Manchester, where he got on an airplane, which took him to Chicago, where he changed planes and flew to Dallas, where he got another plane going north, and he rented a car and went home.He found the knowledge that he was over 600 miles away from the ocean very comforting; although, later in life, he moved to Nebraska to increase the distance from the sea: there were things he had seen, or thought he had seen, beneath the old pier that night that he would never be able to get out of his head. There were things that lurked beneath gray raincoats that man was not meant to know. Squamous. He did not need to look it up. He knew. They were squamous.A couple of weeks after his return home Ben posted his annotated copy of A Walking Tour of the British Coastline to the author, care of her publisher, with an extensive letter containing a number of helpful suggestions for future editions. He also asked the author if she would send him a copy of the page that had been ripped from his guidebook, to set his mind at rest; but he was secretly relieved, as the days turned into months, and the months turned into years and then into decades, that she never replied.

VIRUS
There was a computer game, I was given itone of my friends gave it to me, he was playing it,he said, it's brilliant, you should play it,and I did, and it was. I copied it off the disk he gave mefor anyone, I wanted everyone to play it.Everyone should have this much fun.I sent it upline to bulletin boardsbut mainly I got it out to all of my friends. (Personal contact. That's the way it was given to me.) My friends were like me: some were scared of viruses,someone gave you a game on disk, next week or Friday the 13thit reformatted your hard disk or corrupted your memory.But this one never did that. This was dead safe. Even my friends who didn't like computers started to play:as you get better the game gets harder;maybe you never win but you can get pretty good.I'm pretty good. Of course I have to spend a lot of time playing it.So do my friends. And their friends.And just the people you meet, you can see them,walking down the old motorwaysor standing in queues, away from their computers,away from the arcades that sprang up overnight,but they play it in their heads in the meantime,combining shapes,puzzling over contours, putting colors next to colors,twisting signals to new screen sections,listening to the music. Sure, people think about it, but mainly they play it.My record's eighteen hours at a stretch.40,012 points, 3 fanfares. You play through the tears, the aching wrist, the hunger, after a whileit all goes away.All of it except the game, I should say. There's no room in my mind anymore; no room for other things.We copied the game, gave it to our friends.It transcends language, occupies our time,sometimes I think I'm forgetting things these days. I wonder what happened to the TV. There used to be TV.I wonder what will happen when I run out of canned food.I wonder where all the people went. And then I realize how,if I'm fast enough, I can put a black square next to a red line,mirror it and rotate them so they both disappear,clearing the left blockfor a white bubble to rise . . . (So they both disappear.) And when the power goes off for good then IWill play it in my head until I die.

LOOKING FOR THE GIRL
I was nineteen in 1965, in my drainpipe trousers with my hair quietly creeping down toward my collar. Every time you turned on the radio the Beatles were singing Help! and I wanted to be John Lennon with all the girls screaming after me, always ready with a cynical quip. That was the year I bought my first copy of Penthouse from a small tobacconist's in the King's Road. I paid my few furtive shillings and went home with it stuffed up my jumper, occasionally glancing down to see if it had burnt a hole in the fabric.The copy has long since been thrown away, but I'll always remember it: sedate letters about censorship; a short story by H. E. Bates and an interview with an American novelist I had never heard of; a fashion spread of mohair suits and paisley ties, all to be bought on Carnaby Street. And best of all, there were girls, of course; and best of all the girls, there was Charlotte.Charlotte was nineteen, too.All the girls in that long-gone magazine seemed identical with their perfect plastic flesh; not a hair out of place (you could almost smell the lacquer); smiling wholesomely at the camera while their eyes squinted at you through forest-thick eyelashes: white lipstick; white teeth, white breasts, bikini-bleached. I never gave a thought to the strange positions they had coyly arranged themselves into to avoid showing the slightest curl or shadow of pubic hair-I wouldn't have known what I was looking at anyway. I had eyes only for their pale bottoms and breasts, their chaste but inviting come-on glances.Then I turned the page, and I saw Charlotte. She was different from the others. Charlotte was sex; she wore sexuality like a translucent veil, like a heady perfume.There were words beside the pictures, and I read them in a daze. ""The entrancing Charlotte Reave is nineteen . . . a resurgent individualist and beat poet, contributor to FAB magazine . . ."" Phrases stuck to my mind as I pored over the flat pictures: she posed and pouted in a Chelsea flat-the photographer's, I guessed-and I knew that I needed her.She was my age. It was fate.Charlotte.Charlotte was nineteen.I bought Penthouse regularly after that, hoping she'd appear again. But she didn't. Not then.Six months later my mum found a shoebox under my bed and looked inside it. First she threw a scene, then she threw out all the magazines, finally she threw me out. The next day I got a job and a bedsit in Earl's Court, without, all things considered, too much trouble.My job, my first, was at an electrical shop off the Edgware Road. All I could do was change a plug, but in those days people could afford to get an electrician in to do just that. My boss told me I could learn on the job.I lasted three weeks. My first job was a proper thrill-changing the plug on the bedside light of an English film star, who had achieved fame through his portrayal of laconic Cockney Casanovas. When I got there he was in bed with two honest-to-goodness dolly birds. I changed the plug and left-it was all very proper. I didn't even catch a glimpse of nipple, let alone get invited to join them.Three weeks later I got fired and lost my virginity on the same day. It was a posh place in Hampstead, empty apart from the maid, a little dark-haired woman a few years older than me. I got down on my knees to change the plug, and she climbed on a chair next to me to dust off the top of a door. I looked up: under her skirt she was wearing stockings, and suspenders, and, so help me, nothing else. I discovered what happened in the bits the pictures didn't show you.So I lost my cherry under a dining room table in Hampstead. You don't see maidservants anymore. They have gone the way of the bubble car and the dinosaur.It was afterward that I lost my job. Not even my boss, convinced as he was of my utter incompetence, believed I could have taken three hours to change a plug-and I wasn't about to tell him that I'd spent two of the hours I'd been gone hiding underneath the dining room table when the master and mistress of the house came home unexpectedly, was I?I got a succession of short-lived jobs after that: first as a printer, then as a typesetter, before I wound up in a little ad agency above a sandwich shop in Old Compton Street.I carried on buying Penthouse. Everybody looked like an extra in ""The Avengers,"" but they looked like that in real life. Articles on Woody Allen and Sappho's island, Batman and Vietnam, strippers in action wielding whips, fashion and fiction and sex.The suits gained velvet collars, and the girls messed up their hair. Fetish was fashion. London was swinging, the magazine covers were psychedelic, and if there wasn't acid in the drinking water, we acted as if there ought to have been.I saw Charlotte again in 1969, long after I'd given up on her. I thought that I had forgotten what she looked like. Then one day the head of the agency dropped a Penthouse on my desk-there was a cigarette ad we'd placed in it that he was particularly pleased with. I was twenty-three, a rising star, running the art department as if I knew what I was doing, and sometimes I did.I don't remember much about the issue itself; all I remember is Charlotte. Hair wild and tawny, eyes provocative, smiling like she knew all the secrets of life, and she was keeping them close to her naked chest. Her name wasn't Charlotte then, it was Melanie, or something like that. The text said that she was nineteen.I was living with a dancer called Rachel at the time, in a flat in Camden Town. She was the best-looking, most delightful woman I've ever known, was Rachel. And I went home early with those pictures of Charlotte in my briefcase, and locked myself in the bathroom, and I wanked myself into a daze.We broke up shortly after that, me and Rachel.The ad agency boomed-everything in the sixties boomed-and in 1971 I was given the task of finding ""The Face"" for a clothing label. They wanted a girl who would epitomize everything sexual; who would wear their clothes as if she were about to reach up and rip them off-if some man didn't get there first. And I knew the perfect girl: Charlotte.I phoned Penthouse, who didn't know what I was talking about, but, reluctantly, put me in touch with both of the photographers who had shot her in the past. The man at Penthouse didn't seem convinced when I told them it was the same girl each time.I got hold of the photographers, trying to find her agency.They said she didn't exist.At least not in any way you could pin down, she didn't. Sure, both of them knew the girl I meant. But as one of them told me, ""Like, weird,"" she'd come to them. They'd paid her a modeling fee and sold the pictures. No, they didn't have any addresses for her.I was twenty-six and a fool. I saw immediately what must be happening: I was being given the runaround. Some other ad agency had obviously signed her, was planning a big campaign around her, had paid the photographers to keep quiet. I cursed and I shouted at them over the phone. I made outrageous financial offers.They told me to fuck off.And the next month she was in Penthouse. No longer a psychedelic tease mag, it had become classier-the girls had grown pubic hair, had man-eating glints in their eyes. Men and women romped in soft focus through cornfields, pink against the gold.Her name, said the text, was Belinda. She was an antique dealer. It was Charlotte, all right, although her hair was dark and piled in rich ringlets over her head. The text also gave her age: nineteen.I phoned my contact at Penthouse and got the name of the photographer, John Felbridge. I rang him. Like the others, he claimed to know nothing about her, but by now I'd learned a lesson. Instead of shouting at him down the telephone line, I gave him a job, on a fairly sizable account, shooting a small boy eating ice cream. Felbridge was long-haired, in his late thirties, with a ratty fur coat and plimsolls that were flapping open, but a good photographer. After the shoot, I took him out for a drink, and we talked about the lousy weather, and photography, and decimal currency, and his previous work, and Charlotte.""So you were saying you'd seen the pictures in Penthouse?"" Felbridge said.I nodded. We were both slightly drunk.""I'll tell you about that girl. You know something? She's why I want to give up glamour work and go legit. Said her name was Belinda.""""How did you meet her?""""I'm getting to that, aren't I? I thought she was from an agency, didn't I? She knocks on the door, I think strewth! and invite her in. She said she wasn't from an agency, she says she's selling . . . "" He wrinkled his brow, confused. ""Isn't that odd? I've forgotten what she was selling. Maybe she wasn't selling anything. I don't know. I'll forget me own name next.""I knew she was something special. Asked her if she'd pose, told her it was kosher, I wasn't just trying to get into her pants, and she agrees. Click, flash! Five rolls, just like that. As soon as we're finished, she's got her clothes back on, heads out the door pretty-as-you-please. 'What about your money?' I says to her. 'Send it to me,' she says, and she's down the steps and onto the road.""""So you have got her address?"" I asked, trying to keep the interest out of my voice.""No. Bugger all. I wound up setting her fee aside in case she comes back.""I remember, in with the disappointment, wondering whether his Cockney accent was real or merely fashionable.""But what I was leading up to is this. When the pictures came back, I knew I'd . . . well, as far as tits and fanny went, no-as far as the whole photographing women thing went-I'd done it all. She was women, see? I'd done it. No, no, let me get you one. My shout. Bloody Mary, wasn't it? I gotter say, I'm looking forward to our future work together . . . ""There wasn't to be any future work.The agency was taken over by an older, bigger firm, who wanted our accounts. They incorporated the initials of the firm into their own and kept on a few top copywriters, but they let the rest of us go.I went back to my flat and waited for the offers of work to pour in, which they didn't, but a friend of a girlfriend of a friend starting chatting to me late one night in a club (music by a guy I'd never heard of, name of David Bowie. He was dressed as a spaceman, the rest of his band were in silver cowboy outfits. I didn't even listen to the songs), and the next thing you know I was managing a rock band of my own, the Diamonds of Flame. Unless you were hanging around the London club scene in the early seventies you'll never have heard of them, although they were a very good band. Tight, lyrical. Five guys. Two of them are currently in world-league supergroups. One of them's a plumber in Walsall; he still sends me Christmas cards. The other two have been dead for fifteen years: anonymous ODs. They went within a week of each other, and it broke up the band.It broke me up, too. I dropped out after that-I wanted to get as far away from the city and that lifestyle as I could. I bought a small farm in Wales. I was happy there, too, with the sheep and the goats and the cabbages. I'd probably be there today if it hadn't been for her and Penthouse.I don't know where it came from; one morning I went outside to find the magazine lying in the yard, in the mud, face down. It was almost a year old. She wore no makeup and was posed in what looked like a very high-class flat. For the first time I could see her pubic hair, or I could have if the photo hadn't been artistically fuzzed and just a fraction out of focus. She looked as if she were coming out of the mist.Her name, it said, was Lesley. She was nineteen.And after that I just couldn't stay away anymore. I sold the farm for a pittance and came back to London in the last days of 1976.I went on the dole, lived in a council flat in Victoria, got up at lunchtime, hit the pubs until they closed in the afternoons, read newspapers in the library until opening time, then pub-crawled until closing time. I lived off my dole money and drank from my savings account.I was thirty and I felt much older. I started living with an anonymous blonde punkette from Canada I met in a drinking club in Greek Street. She was the barmaid, and one night, after closing, she told me she'd just lost her digs, so I offered her the sofa at my place. She was only sixteen, it turned out, and she never got to sleep on the sofa. She had small, pomegranate breasts, a skull tattooed on her back, and a junior Bride of Frankenstein hairdo. She said she'd done everything and believed in nothing. She would talk for hours about the way the world was moving toward a condition of anarchy, claimed that there was no hope and no future; but she fucked like she'd just invented fucking. And I figured that was good.She'd come to bed wearing nothing but a spiky black leather dog collar and masses of messy black eye makeup. She spat sometimes, just gobbed on the pavement, when we were walking, which I hated, and she made me take her to the punk clubs, to watch her gob and swear and pogo. Then I really felt old. I liked some of the music, though: Peaches, stuff like that. And I saw the Sex Pistols play live. They were rotten.Then the punkette walked out on me, claiming that I was a boring old fart, and she took up with an extremely plump Arab princeling.""I thought you didn't believe in anything,"" I called after her as she climbed into the Roller he sent to collect her.""I believe in hundred quid blowjobs and mink sheets,"" she called back, one hand playing with a strand of her Bride of Frankenstein hairdo. ""And a gold vibrator. I believe in that.""So she went away to an oil fortune and a new wardrobe, and checked my savings and found I was dead broke-practically penniless. I was still sporadically buying Penthouse. My sixties soul was both deeply shocked and profoundly thrilled by the amount of flesh now on view. Nothing was left to the imagination, which, at the same time, attracted and repelled me.Then, near the end of 1977, she was there again.Her hair was multicolored, my Charlotte, and her mouth was as crimson as if she'd been eating raspberries. She lay on satin sheets with a jeweled mask on her face and a hand between her legs, ecstatic, orgasmic, all I ever wanted: Charlotte.She was appearing under the name of Titania and was draped with peacock feathers. She worked, I was informed by the insectile black words that crept around her photographs, in an estate agent's in the South. She liked sensitive, honest men. She was nineteen.And goddamn it, she looked nineteen. And I was broke, on the dole with just over a million others, and going nowhere.I sold my record collection, and my books, all but four copies of Penthouse, and most of the furniture, and I bought myself a fairly good camera. Then I phoned all the photographers I'd known when I was in advertising almost a decade before.Most of them didn't remember me, or they said they didn't. And those that did, didn't want an eager young assistant who wasn't young anymore and had no experience. But I kept trying and eventually got hold of Harry Bleak, a silver-haired old boy with his own studios in Crouch End and a posse of expensive little boyfriends.I told him what I wanted. He didn't even stop to think about it. ""Be here in two hours.""""No catches?""""Two hours. No more.""I was there.For the first year I cleaned the studio, painted backdrops, and went out to the local shops and streets to beg, buy, or borrow appropriate props. The next year he let me help with the lights, set up shots, waft smoke pellets and dry ice around, and make the tea. I'm exaggerating-I only made the tea once; I make terrible tea. But I learned a hell of a lot about photography.And suddenly it was 1981, and the world was newly romantic, and I was thirty-five and feeling every minute of it. Bleak told me to look after the studio for a few weeks while he went off to Morocco for a month of well-earned debauchery.She was in Penthouse that month. More coy and prim than before, waiting for me neatly between advertisements for stereos and Scotch. She was called Dawn, but she was still my Charlotte, with nipples like beads of blood on her tanned breasts, dark fuzzy thatch between forever legs, shot on location on a beach somewhere. She was only nineteen, said the text. Charlotte. Dawn.Harry Bleak was killed traveling back from Morocco: a bus fell on him.It's not funny, really-he was on a car ferry coming back from Calais, and he snuck down into the car hold to get his cigars, which he'd left in the glove compartment of the Merc.The weather was rough, and a tourist bus (belonging, I read in the papers, and was told at length by a tearful boyfriend, to a shopping co-op in Wigan) hadn't been chained down properly. Harry was crushed against the side of his silver Mercdes.He had always kept that car spotless.When the will was read I discovered that the old bastard had left me his studio. I cried myself to sleep that night, got stinking drunk for a week, and then opened for business.Things happened between then and now. I got married. It lasted three weeks, then we called it a day. I guess I'm not the marrying type. I got beaten up by a drunken Glaswegian on a train late one night, and the other passengers pretended it wasn't happening. I bought a couple of terrapins and a tank, put them in the flat over the studio, and called them Rodney and Kevin. I became a fairly good photographer. I did calendars, advertising, fashion and glamour work, little kids and big stars: the works.And one spring day in 1985, I met Charlotte.I was alone in the studio on a Thursday morning, unshaven and barefoot. It was a free day, and I was going to spend it cleaning the place and reading the papers. I had left the studio doors open, letting the fresh air in to replace the stink of cigarettes and spilled wine of the shoot the night before, when a woman's voice said, ""Bleak Photographic?""""That's right,"" I said, not turning around, ""but Bleak's dead. I run the place now.""""I want to model for you,"" she said.I turned around. She was about five foot six, with honey-colored hair, olive green eyes, a smile like cold water in the desert.""Charlotte?""She tilted her head to one side. ""If you like. Do you want to take my picture?""I nodded dumbly. Plugged in the umbrellas, stood her up against a bare brick wall, and shot off a couple of test Polaroids. No special makeup, no set, just a few lights, a Hasselblad, and the most beautiful girl in my world.After a while, she began to take off her clothes. I did not ask her to. I don't remember saying anything to her. She undressed and I carried on taking photographs.She knew it all. How to pose, to preen, to stare. Silently she flirted with the camera, and with me standing behind it, moving around her, clicking away. I don't remember stopping for anything, but I must have changed films, because I wound up with a dozen rolls at the end of the day.I suppose you think that after the pictures were taken, I made love with her. Now, I'd be a liar if I said I've never screwed models in my time, and, for that matter, some of them have screwed me. But I didn't touch her. She was my dream; and if you touch a dream it vanishes, like a soap bubble.And anyway, I simply couldn't touch her.""How old are you?"" I asked her just before she left, when she was pulling on her coat and picking up her bag.""Nineteen,"" she told me without looking around, and then she was out the door.She didn't say good-bye.I sent the photos to Penthouse. I couldn't think of anywhere else to send them. Two days later I got a call from the art editor. ""Loved the girl! Real face-of-the-eighties stuff. What are her vital statistics?""""Her name is Charlotte,"" I told him. ""She's nineteen.""And now I'm thirty-nine, and one day I'll be fifty, and she'll still be nineteen. But someone else will be taking the photographs.Rachel, my dancer, married an architect.The blonde punkette from Canada runs a multinational fashion chain. I do some photographic work for her from time to time. Her hair's cut short, and there's a smudge of gray in it, and she's a lesbian these days. She told me she's still got the mink sheets, but she made up the bit about the gold vibrator.My ex-wife married a nice bloke who owns two video rental shops, and they moved to Slough. They have twin boys.I don't know what happened to the maid.And Charlotte?In Greece the philosophers are debating, Socrates is drinking hemlock, and she's posing for a sculpture of Erato, muse of light poetry and lovers, and she's nineteen.In Crete she's oiling her breasts, and she's jumping bulls in the ring while King Minos applauds, and someone's painting her likeness on a wine jar, and she's nineteen.In 2065 she's stretched out on the revolving floor of a holographic photographer, who records her as an erotic dream in Living Sensolove, imprisons the sight and sound and the very smell of her in a tiny diamond matrix. She's only nineteen.And a caveman outlines Charlotte with a burnt stick on the wall of the temple cave, filling in the shape and the texture of her with earths and berry dyes. Nineteen.Charlotte is there, in all places, all times, sliding through our fantasies, a girl forever.I want her so much it makes me hurt sometimes. That's when I take down the photographs of her and just look at them for a while, wondering why I didn't try to touch her, why I wouldn't really even speak to her when she was there, and never coming up with an answer that I could understand.That's why I've written this all down, I suppose.This morning I noticed yet another gray hair at my temple. Charlotte is nineteen. Somewhere.

ONLY
THE END OF THE WORLD AGAIN
It was a bad day: I woke up naked in the bed with a cramp in my stomach, feeling more or less like hell. Something about the quality of the light, stretched and metallic, like the color of a migraine, told me it was afternoon.The room was freezing-literally: there was a thin crust of ice on the inside of the windows. The sheets on the bed around me were ripped and clawed, and there was animal hair in the bed. It itched.I was thinking about staying in bed for the next week-I'm always tired after a change-but a wave of nausea forced me to disentangle myself from the bedding and to stumble, hurriedly, into the apartment's tiny bathroom.The cramps hit me again as I got to the bathroom door. I held on to the door frame and I started to sweat. Maybe it was a fever; I hoped I wasn't coming down with something.The cramping was sharp in my guts. My head felt swimmy. I crumpled to the floor, and, before I could manage to raise my head enough to find the toilet bowl, I began to spew.I vomited a foul-smelling thin yellow liquid; in it was a dog's paw-my guess was a Doberman's, but I'm not really a dog person; a tomato peel; some diced carrots and sweet corn; some lumps of half-chewed meat, raw; and some fingers. They were fairly small pale fingers, obviously a child's.""Shit.""The cramps eased up, and the nausea subsided. I lay on the floor with stinking drool coming out of my mouth and nose, with the tears you cry when you're being sick drying on my cheeks.When I felt a little better, I picked up the paw and the fingers from the pool of spew and threw them into the toilet bowl, flushed them away.I turned on the tap, rinsed out my mouth with the briny Innsmouth water, and spat it into the sink. I mopped up the rest of the sick as best I could with washcloth and toilet paper. Then I turned on the shower and stood in the bathtub like a zombie as the hot water sluiced over me.I soaped myself down, body and hair. The meager lather turned gray; I must have been filthy. My hair was matted with something that felt like dried blood, and I worked at it with the bar of soap until it was gone. Then I stood under the shower until the water turned icy.There was a note under the door from my landlady. It said that I owed her for two weeks' rent. It said that all the answers were in the Book of Revelations. It said that I made a lot of noise coming home in the early hours of this morning, and she'd thank me to be quieter in future. It said that when the Elder Gods rose up from the ocean, all the scum of the Earth, all the nonbelievers, all the human garbage and the wastrels and deadbeats would be swept away, and the world would be cleansed by ice and deep water. It said that she felt she ought to remind me that she had assigned me a shelf in the refrigerator when I arrived and she'd thank me if in the future I'd keep to it.I crumpled the note, dropped it on the floor, where it lay alongside the Big Mac cartons and the empty pizza cartons and the long-dead dried slices of pizza.It was time to go to work.I'd been in Innsmouth for two weeks, and I disliked it. It smelled fishy. It was a claustrophobic little town: marshland to the east, cliffs to the west, and, in the center, a harbor that held a few rotting fishing boats and was not even scenic at sunset. The yuppies had come to Innsmouth in the eighties anyway, bought their picturesque fisherman's cottages overlooking the harbor. The yuppies had been gone for some years now, and the cottages by the bay were crumbling, abandoned.The inhabitants of Innsmouth lived here and there in and around the town and in the trailer parks that ringed it, filled with dank mobile homes that were never going anywhere.I got dressed, pulled on my boots, put on my coat, and left my room. My landlady was nowhere to be seen. She was a short pop-eyed woman who spoke little, although she left extensive notes for me pinned to doors and placed where I might see them; she kept the house filled with the smell of boiling seafood: huge pots were always simmering on the kitchen stove, filled with things with too many legs and other things with no legs at all.There were other rooms in the house, but no one else rented them. No one in their right mind would come to Innsmouth in winter.Outside the house it didn't smell much better. It was colder, though, and my breath steamed in the sea air. The snow on the streets was crusty and filthy; the clouds promised more snow.A cold salty wind came up off the bay. The gulls were screaming miserably. I felt shitty. My office would be freezing, too. On the corner of Marsh Street and Leng Avenue was a bar, The Opener, a squat building with small dark windows that I'd passed two dozen times in the last couple of weeks. I hadn't been in before, but I really needed a drink, and besides, it might be warmer in there. I pushed open the door.The bar was indeed warm. I stamped the snow off my boots and went inside. It was almost empty and smelled of old ashtrays and stale beer. A couple of elderly men were playing chess by the bar. The barman was reading a battered old gilt-and-green-leather edition of the poetical works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson.""Hey. How about a Jack Daniel's, straight up?""""Sure thing. You're new in town,"" he told me, putting his book face down on the bar, pouring the drink into a glass.""Does it show?""He smiled, passed me the Jack Daniel's. The glass was filthy, with a greasy thumbprint on the side, and I shrugged and knocked back the drink anyway. I could barely taste it.""Hair of the dog?"" he said.""In a manner of speaking.""""There is a belief,"" said the barman, whose fox-red hair was tightly greased back, ""that the lykanthropoi can be returned to their natural forms by thanking them, while they're in wolf form, or by calling them by their given names.""""Yeah? Well, thanks.""He poured another shot for me, unasked. He looked a little like Peter Lorre, but then, most of the folk in Innsmouth look a little like Peter Lorre, including my landlady.I sank the Jack Daniel's, this time felt it burning down into my stomach, the way it should.""It's what they say. I never said I believed it.""""What do you believe?""""Burn the girdle.""""Pardon?""""The lykanthropoi have girdles of human skin, given to them at their first transformation by their masters in Hell. Burn the girdle.""One of the old chess players turned to me then, his eyes huge and blind and protruding. ""If you drink rainwater out of warg-wolf's pawprint, that'll make a wolf of you, when the moon is full,"" he said. ""The only cure is to hunt down the wolf that made the print in the first place and cut off its head with a knife forged of virgin silver.""""Virgin, huh?"" I smiled.His chess partner, bald and wrinkled, shook his head and croaked a single sad sound. Then he moved his queen and croaked again.There are people like him all over Innsmouth.I paid for the drinks and left a dollar tip on the bar. The barman was reading his book once more and ignored it.Outside the bar big wet kissy flakes of snow had begun to fall, settling in my hair and eyelashes. I hate snow. I hate New England. I hate Innsmouth: it's no place to be alone, but if there's a good place to be alone, I've not found it yet. Still, business has kept me on the move for more moons than I like to think about. Business, and other things.I walked a couple of blocks down Marsh Street-like most of Innsmouth, an unattractive mixture of eighteenth-century American Gothic houses, late-nineteenth-century stunted brownstones, and late-twentieth prefab gray-brick boxes-until I got to a boarded-up fried chicken joint, and I went up the stone steps next to the store and unlocked the rusting metal security door.There was a liquor store across the street; a palmist was operating on the second floor.Someone had scrawled graffiti in black marker on the metal: JUST DIE, it said. Like it was easy.The stairs were bare wood; the plaster was stained and peeling. My one-room office was at the top of the stairs.I don't stay anywhere long enough to bother with my name in gilt on glass. It was handwritten in block letters on a piece of ripped cardboard that I'd thumbtacked to the door. LAWRENCE TALBOTADJUSTOR I unlocked the door to my office and went in.I inspected my office, while adjectives like seedy and rancid and squalid wandered through my head, then gave up, outclassed. It was fairly unprepossessing-a desk, an office chair, an empty filing cabinet; a window, which gave you a terrific view of the liquor store and the empty palmist's. The smell of old cooking grease permeated from the store below. I wondered how long the fried chicken joint had been boarded up; I imagined a multitude of black cockroaches swarming over every surface in the darkness beneath me.""That's the shape of the world that you're thinking of there,"" said a deep dark voice, deep enough that I felt it in the pit of my stomach.There was an old armchair in one corner of the office. The remains of a pattern showed through the patina of age and grease the years had given it. It was the color of dust.The fat man sitting in the armchair, his eyes still tightly closed, continued: ""We look about in puzzlement at our world, with a sense of unease and disquiet. We think of ourselves as scholars in arcane liturgies, single men trapped in worlds beyond our devising. The truth is far simpler: there are things in the darkness beneath us that wish us harm.""His head was lolled back on the armchair, and the tip of his tongue poked out of the corner of his mouth.""You read my mind?""The man in the armchair took a slow deep breath that rattled in the back of his throat. He really was immensely fat, with stubby fingers like discolored sausages. He wore a thick old coat, once black, now an indeterminate gray. The snow on his boots had not entirely melted.""Perhaps. The end of the world is a strange concept. The world is always ending, and the end is always being averted, by love or foolishness or just plain old dumb luck.""Ah well. It's too late now: The Elder Gods have chosen their vessels. When the moon rises . . . ""A thin trickle of drool came from one corner of his mouth, oozed down in a thread of silver to his collar. Something scuttled from his collar into the shadows of his coat.""Yeah? What happens when the moon rises?""The man in the armchair stirred, opened two little eyes, red and swollen, and blinked them in waking.""I dreamed I had many mouths,"" he said, his new voice oddly small and breathy for such a huge man. ""I dreamed every mouth was opening and closing independently. Some mouths were talking, some whispering, some eating, some waiting in silence.""He looked around, wiped the spittle from the corner of his mouth, sat back in the chair, blinking puzzledly. ""Who are you?""""I'm the guy who rents this office,"" I told him.He belched suddenly, loudly. ""I'm sorry,"" he said in his breathy voice, and lifted himself heavily from the armchair. He was shorter than I was, when he was standing. He looked me up and down blearily. ""Silver bullets,"" he pronounced after a short pause. ""Old-fashioned remedy.""""Yeah,"" I told him. ""That's so obvious-must be why I didn't think of it. Gee, I could just kick myself. I really could.""""You're making fun of an old man,"" he told me.""Not really. I'm sorry. Now, out of here. Some of us have work to do.""He shambled out. I sat down in the swivel chair at the desk by the window and discovered, after some minutes, through trial and error, that if I swiveled the chair to the left, it fell off its base.So I sat still and waited for the dusty black telephone on my desk to ring while the light slowly leaked away from the winter sky.Ring.A man's voice: Had I thought about aluminum siding? I put down the phone.There was no heating in the office. I wondered how long the fat man had been asleep in the armchair.Twenty minutes later the phone rang again. A crying woman implored me to help her find her five-year-old daughter, missing since last night, stolen from her bed. The family dog had vanished, too.I don't do missing children, I told her. I'm sorry: too many bad memories. I put down the telephone, feeling sick again.It was getting dark now, and, for the first time since I had been in Innsmouth, the neon sign across the street flicked on. It told me that MADAME EZEKIEL performed TAROT READINGS AND PALMISTRY.Red neon stained the falling snow the color of new blood.Armageddon is averted by small actions. That's the way it was. That's the way it always has to be.The phone rang a third time. I recognized the voice; it was the aluminum siding man again. ""You know,"" he said chattily, ""transformation from man to animal and back being, by definition, impossible, we need to look for other solutions. Depersonalization, obviously, and likewise some form of projection. Brain damage? Perhaps. Pseudoneurotic schizophrenia? Laughably so. Some cases have been treated with intravenous thioridazine hydrochloride.""""Successfully?""He chuckled. ""That's what I like. A man with a sense of humor. I'm sure we can do business.""""I told you already. I don't need aluminum siding.""""Our business is more remarkable than that and of far greater importance. You're new in town, Mr. Talbot. It would be a pity if we found ourselves at, shall we say, loggerheads?""""You can say whatever you like, pal. In my book you're just another adjustment, waiting to be made.""""We're ending the world, Mr. Talbot. The Deep Ones will rise out of their ocean graves and eat the moon like a ripe plum.""""Then I won't ever have to worry about full moons anymore, will I?""""Don't try to cross us,"" he began, but I growled at him, and he fell silent.Outside my window the snow was still falling.Across Marsh Street, in the window directly opposite mine, the most beautiful woman I had ever seen stood in the ruby glare of her neon sign, and she stared at me.She beckoned with one finger.I put down the phone on the aluminum siding man for the second time that afternoon, and went downstairs, and crossed the street at something close to a run; but I looked both ways before I crossed.She was dressed in silks. The room was lit only by candles and stank of incense and patchouli oil.She smiled at me as I walked in, beckoned me over to her seat by the window. She was playing a card game with a tarot deck, some version of solitaire. As I reached her, one elegant hand swept up the cards, wrapped them in a silk scarf, placed them gently in a wooden box.The scents of the room made my head pound. I hadn't eaten anything today, I realized; perhaps that was what was making me lightheaded. I sat down across the table from her, in the candlelight.She extended her hand and took my hand in hers.She stared at my palm, touched it, softly, with her forefinger.""Hair?"" She was puzzled.""Yeah, well. I'm on my own a lot."" I grinned. I had hoped it was a friendly grin, but she raised an eyebrow at me anyway.""When I look at you,"" said Madame Ezekiel, ""this is what I see. I see the eye of a man. Also I see the eye of a wolf. In the eye of a man I see honesty, decency, innocence. I see an upright man who walks on the square. And in the eye of wolf I see a groaning and a growling, night howls and cries, I see a monster running with blood-flecked spittle in the darkness of the borders of the town.""""How can you see a growl or a cry?""She smiled. ""It is not hard,"" she said. Her accent was not American. It was Russian, or Maltese, or Egyptian perhaps. ""In the eye of the mind we see many things.""Madame Ezekiel closed her green eyes. She had remarkably long eyelashes; her skin was pale, and her black hair was never still-it drifted gently around her head, in the silks, as if it were floating on distant tides.""There is a traditional way,"" she told me. ""A way to wash off a bad shape. You stand in running water, in clear spring water, while eating white rose petals.""""And then?""""The shape of darkness will be washed from you.""""It will return,"" I told her, ""with the next full of the moon.""""So,"" said Madame Ezekiel, ""once the shape is washed from you, you open your veins in the running water. It will sting mightily, of course. But the river will carry the blood away.""She was dressed in silks, in scarves and cloths of a hundred different colors, each bright and vivid, even in the muted light of the candles.Her eyes opened.""Now,"" she said, ""the tarot."" She unwrapped her deck from the black silk scarf that held it, passed me the cards to shuffle. I fanned them, riffed and bridged them.""Slower, slower,"" she said. ""Let them get to know you. Let them love you, like . . . like a woman would love you.""I held them tightly, then passed them back to her.She turned over the first card. It was called The Warwolf. It showed darkness and amber eyes, a smile in white and red.Her green eyes showed confusion. They were the green of emeralds. ""This is not a card from my deck,"" she said and turned over the next card. ""What did you do to my cards?""""Nothing, ma'am. I just held them. That's all.""The card she had turned over was The Deep One. It showed something green and faintly octopoid. The thing's mouths-if they were indeed mouths and not tentacles-began to writhe on the card as I watched.She covered it with another card, and then another, and another. The rest of the cards were blank pasteboard.""Did you do that?"" She sounded on the verge of tears.""No.""""Go now,"" she said.""But-""""Go."" She looked down, as if trying to convince herself I no longer existed.I stood up, in the room that smelled of incense and candlewax, and looked out of her window, across the street. A light flashed briefly in my office window. Two men with flashlights were walking around. They opened the empty filing cabinet, peered around, then took up their positions, one in the armchair, the other behind the door, waiting for me to return. I smiled to myself. It was cold and inhospitable in my office, and with any luck they would wait there for hours until they finally decided I wasn't coming back.So I left Madame Ezekiel turning over her cards, one by one, staring at them as if that would make the pictures return; and I went downstairs and walked back down Marsh Street until I reached the bar.The place was empty now; the barman was smoking a cigarette, which he stubbed out as I came in.""Where are the chess fiends?""""It's a big night for them tonight. They'll be down at the bay. Let's see. You're a Jack Daniel's? Right?'""Sounds good.""He poured it for me. I recognized the thumbprint from the last time I had the glass. I picked up the volume of Tennyson poems from the bar top.""Good book?""The fox-haired barman took his book from me, opened it, and read:""Below the thunders of the upper deep;Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,His ancient dreamless, uninvaded sleepThe Kraken sleepeth . . . ""I'd finished my drink. ""So? What's your point?""He walked around the bar, took me over to the window. ""See? Out there?""He pointed toward the west of the town, toward the cliffs. As I stared a bonfire was kindled on the cliff tops; it flared and began to burn with a copper-green flame.""They're going to wake the Deep Ones,"" said the barman. ""The stars and the planets and the moon are all in the right places. It's time. The dry lands will sink, and the seas shall rise . . . """" 'For the world shall be cleansed with ice and floods, and I'll thank you to keep to your own shelf in the refrigerator,' "" I said.""Sorry?""""Nothing. What's the quickest way to get up to those cliffs?""""Back up Marsh Street. Hang a left at the Church of Dagon till you reach Manuxet Way, then just keep on going."" He pulled a coat off the back of the door and put it on. ""C'mon. I'll walk you up there. I'd hate to miss any of the fun.""""You sure?""""No one in town's going to be drinking tonight."" We stepped out, and he locked the door to the bar behind us.It was chilly in the street, and fallen snow blew about the ground like white mists. From street level, I could no longer tell if Madame Ezekiel was in her den above her neon sign or if my guests were still waiting for me in my office.We put our heads down against the wind, and we walked.Over the noise of the wind I heard the barman talking to himself:""Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green,"" he was saying.""There hath he lain for ages and will lieBattening upon huge seaworms in his sleep,Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;Then once by men and angels to be seen,In roaring he shall rise . . . ""He stopped there, and we walked on together in silence with blown snow stinging our faces.And on the surface die, I thought, but said nothing out loud.Twenty minutes' walking and we were out of Innsmouth. Manuxet Way stopped when we left the town, and it became a narrow dirt path, partly covered with snow and ice, and we slipped and slid our way up it in the darkness.The moon was not yet up, but the stars had already begun to come out. There were so many of them. They were sprinkled like diamond dust and crushed sapphires across the night sky. You can see so many stars from the seashore, more than you could ever see back in the city.At the top of the cliff, behind the bonfire, two people were waiting-one huge and fat, one much smaller. The barman left my side and walked over to stand beside them, facing me.""Behold,"" he said, ""the sacrificial wolf."" There was now an oddly familiar quality to his voice.I didn't say anything. The fire was burning with green flames, and it lit the three of them from below: classic spook lighting.""Do you know why I brought you up here?"" asked the barman, and I knew then why his voice was familiar: it was the voice of the man who had attempted to sell me aluminum siding.""To stop the world ending?""He laughed at me then.The second figure was the fat man I had found asleep in my office chair. ""Well, if you're going to get eschatalogical about it . . ."" he murmured in a voice deep enough to rattle walls. His eyes were closed. He was fast asleep.The third figure was shrouded in dark silks and smelled of patchouli oil. It held a knife. It said nothing.""This night,"" said the barman, ""the moon is the moon of the Deep Ones. This night are the stars configured in the shapes and patterns of the dark old times. This night, if we call them, they will come. If our sacrifice is worthy. If our cries are heard.""The moon rose, huge and amber and heavy, on the other side of the bay, and a chorus of low croaking rose with it from the ocean far beneath us.Moonlight on snow and ice is not daylight, but it will do. And my eyes were getting sharper with the moon: in the cold waters men like frogs were surfacing and submerging in a slow water dance. Men like frogs, and women, too: it seemed to me that I could see my landlady down there, writhing and croaking in the bay with the rest of them.It was too soon for another change; I was still exhausted from the night before; but I felt strange under that amber moon.""Poor wolf-man,"" came a whisper from the silks. ""All his dreams have come to this: a lonely death upon a distant cliff.""I will dream if I want to, I said, and my death is my own affair. But I was unsure if I had said it out loud.Senses heighten in the moon's light; I heard the roar of the ocean still, but now, overlaid on top of it, I could hear each wave rise and crash; I heard the splash of the frog people; I heard the drowned whispers of the dead in the bay; I heard the creak of green wrecks far beneath the ocean.Smell improves, too. The aluminum siding man was human, while the fat man had other blood in him.And the figure in the silks . . .I had smelled her perfume when I wore man-shape. Now I could smell something else, less heady, beneath it. A smell of decay, of putrefying meat and rotten flesh.The silks fluttered. She was moving toward me. She held the knife.""Madame Ezekiel?"" My voice was roughening and coarsening. Soon I would lose it all. I didn't understand what was happening, but the moon was rising higher and higher, losing its amber color and filling my mind with its pale light.""Madame Ezekiel?""""You deserve to die,"" she said, her voice cold and low. ""If only for what you did to my cards. They were old.""""I don't die,"" I told her. "" 'Even a man who is pure in heart, and says his prayers by night.' Remember?""""It's bullshit,"" she said. ""You know what the oldest way to end the curse of the werewolf is?""""No.""The bonfire burned brighter now; burned with the green of the world beneath the sea, the green of algae and of slowly drifting weed; burned with the color of emeralds.""You simply wait till they're in human shape, a whole month away from another change; then you take the sacrificial knife and you kill them. That's all.""I turned to run, but the barman was behind me, pulling my arms, twisting my wrists up into the small of my back. The knife glinted pale silver in the moonlight. Madame Ezekiel smiled.She sliced across my throat.Blood began to gush and then to flow. And then it slowed and stopped . . .-The pounding in the front of my head, the pressure in the back. All a roiling change a how-wow-row-now change a red wall coming toward me from the night-I tasted stars dissolved in brine, fizzy and distant and salt-my fingers prickled with pins and my skin was lashed with tongues of flame my eyes were topaz I could taste the night My breath steamed and billowed in the icy air.I growled involuntarily, low in my throat. My forepaws were touching the snow.I pulled back, tensed, and sprang at her.There was a sense of corruption that hung in the air, like a mist, surrounding me. High in my leap, I seemed to pause, and something burst like a soap bubble . . .I was deep, deep in the darkness under the sea, standing on all fours on a slimy rock floor at the entrance of some kind of citadel built of enormous rough-hewn stones. The stones gave off a pale glow-in-the-dark light; a ghostly luminescence, like the hands of a watch.A cloud of black blood trickled from my neck.She was standing in the doorway in front of me. She was now six, maybe seven feet high. There was flesh on her skeletal bones, pitted and gnawed, but the silks were weeds, drifting in the cold water, down there in the dreamless deeps. They hid her face like a slow green veil.There were limpets growing on the upper surfaces of her arms and on the flesh that hung from her ribcage.I felt like I was being crushed. I couldn't think anymore.She moved toward me. The weed that surrounded her head shifted. She had a face like the stuff you don't want to eat in a sushi counter, all suckers and spines and drifting anemone fronds; and somewhere in all that I knew she was smiling.I pushed with my hind legs. We met there, in the deep, and we struggled. It was so cold, so dark. I closed my jaws on her face and felt something rend and tear.It was almost a kiss, down there in the abysmal deep . . .* * *I landed softly on the snow, a silk scarf locked between my jaws. The other scarves were fluttering to the ground. Madame Ezekiel was nowhere to be seen.The silver knife lay on the ground in the snow. I waited on all fours in the moonlight, soaking wet. I shook myself, spraying the brine about. I heard it hiss and spit when it hit the fire.I was dizzy and weak. I pulled the air deep into my lungs.Down, far below, in the bay, I could see the frog people hanging on the surface of the sea like dead things; for a handful of seconds, they drifted back and forth on the tide, then they twisted and leapt, and each by each they plop-plopped down into the bay and vanished beneath the sea.There was a scream. It was the fox-haired bartender, the pop-eyed aluminum siding salesman, and he was staring at the night sky, at the clouds that were drifting in, covering the stars, and he was screaming. There was rage and there was frustration in that cry, and it scared me.He picked up the knife from the ground, wiped the snow from the handle with his fingers, wiped the blood from the blade with his coat. Then he looked across at me. He was crying. ""You bastard,"" he said. ""What did you do to her?""I would have told him I didn't do anything to her, that she was still on guard far beneath the ocean, but I couldn't talk any more, only growl and whine and howl.He was crying. He stank of insanity and of disappointment. He raised the knife and ran at me, and I moved to one side.Some people just can't adjust even to tiny changes. The barman stumbled past me, off the cliff, into nothing.In the moonlight blood is black, not red, and the marks he left on the cliff side as he fell and bounced and fell were smudges of black and dark gray. Then, finally, he lay still on the icy rocks at the base of the cliff until an arm reached out from the sea and dragged him, with a slowness that was almost painful to watch, under the dark water.A hand scratched the back of my head. It felt good.""What was she? Just an avatar of the Deep Ones, sir. An eidolon, a manifestation, if you will, sent up to us from the uttermost deeps to bring about the end of the world."" I bristled.""No, it's over-for now. You disrupted her, sir. And the ritual is most specific. Three of us must stand together and call the sacred names while innocent blood pools and pulses at our feet.""I looked up at the fat man and whined a query. He patted me on the back of the neck sleepily.""Of course she doesn't love you, boy. She hardly even exists on this plane in any material sense.""The snow began to fall once more. The bonfire was going out.""Your change tonight, incidentally, I would opine, is a direct result of the self-same celestial configurations and lunar forces that made tonight such a perfect night to bring back my old friends from Underneath . . . ""He continued talking in his deep voice, and perhaps he was telling me important things. I'll never know, for the appetite was growing inside me, and his words had lost all but the shadow of any meaning; I had no further interest in the sea or the cliff-top or the fat man.There were deer running in the woods beyond the meadow: I could smell them on the winter's night's air.And I was, above all things, hungry.I was naked when I came to myself again, early the next morning, a half-eaten deer next to me in the snow. A fly crawled across its eye, and its tongue lolled out of its dead mouth, making it look comical and pathetic, like an animal in a newspaper cartoon.The snow was stained a fluorescent crimson where the deer's belly had been torn out.My face and chest were sticky and red with the stuff. My throat was scabbed and scarred, and it stung; by the next full moon, it would be whole once more.The sun was a long way away, small and yellow, but the sky was blue and cloudless, and there was no breeze. I could hear the roar of the sea some distance away.I was cold and naked and bloody and alone. Ah well, I thought, it happens to all of us in the beginning. I just get it once a month.I was painfully exhausted, but I would hold out until I found a deserted barn or a cave; and then I was going to sleep for a couple of weeks.A hawk flew low over the snow toward me with something dangling from its talons. It hovered above me for a heartbeat, then dropped a small gray squid in the snow at my feet and flew upward. The flaccid thing lay there, still and silent and tentacled in the bloody snow.I took it as an omen, but whether good or bad I couldn't say and I didn't really care any more; I turned my back to the sea, and on the shadowy town of Innsmouth, and began to make my way toward the city.

BAY WOLF
Listen, Talbot. Somebody's killing my people,said Roth, growling down the phone like the sea in a shell.Find out who and why and stop them. Stop them how? I asked. Whatever it takes, he said. But I don't want them walking awayafter you stopped them, if you get me.And I got him. And I was hired. Now you listen: this was back in the twenty-twentiesin L.A., down on Venice Beach.Gar Roth owned the business in that part of world,dealt in stims and pumps and steroids,recreationals, built up quite a following.All the buff kids, boys in thongs popping pumpers,girls popping curves and fearmoans and whoremoans,all of them loved Roth. He had the shit.The force took his payoffs to look the other way;he owned the beach world, from Laguna Beach north to Malibu,built a beach hall where the buff and the curvyhung and sucked and flaunted. Oh, but that city worshipped the flesh; and theirs was the flesh.They were partying. Everyone was partying,dusted, shot up, cranked out,the music was so loud you could hear it with your bones,and that was when something took them, quietly,whatever it was. It cracked their heads. It tore them into offal.No one heard the screams over the boom of the oldies and the surf.That was the year of the death metal revival.It took maybe a dozen of them away, dragged them into the sea,death in the early morning.Roth said he thought it was a rival drug cartel,posted more guards, had choppers circling, floaters watchingfor when it came back. As it did, again, again.But the cameras and the vids showed nothing at all. They had no idea what it was, but still,it ripped them limb from limb and head from neck,tore saline bags out from ballooning breasts,left steroid-shrunken testes on the beachlike tiny world-shaped creatures in the sand.Roth had been hurt: The beach was not the same,and that was when he called me on the phone. I stepped over several sleeping cuties of all sexes,tapped Roth on the shoulder. BeforeI could blink, a dozen big gunswere pointing at my chest and head,  so I said, Hey, I'm not a monster.
Well, I'm not your monster, anyway.Not yet. I gave him my card. Talbot, he said.You're the adjuster I spoke to?That's right, I told him, tough-talking in the afternoon,and you got stuff that needs adjusting.This is the deal, I said.I take your problem out. You pay and pay and pay. Roth said, Sure, like we said. Whatever. Deal.Me? I'm thinking it's the Eurisraeli Mafiaor the Chinks. You scared of them? No, I told him. Not scared. I kind of wished I'd been there in the glory days:Now Roth's pretty people were getting kind of thin on the ground,none of them, close up,as plump and curvy as they'd seemed from farther away. At dusk the party starts.I tell Roth that I hated death metal the first time around.He says I must be older than I look.They play real loud. The speakers make the seashore pump and thump. I strip down then for action and I waiton four legs in the hollow of a dune.And days and nights I wait. And wait. And wait. Where the fuck are you and your people?asked Roth on the third day. What the fuck am I paying you for?Nothing on the beach last night but some big dog.But I just smiled. No sign of the problem so far, whatever it is,I said.And I've been here all the time.I tell you it's the Israeli Mafia, he said.I never trusted those Europeans. Third night comes.The moon is huge and a chemical red.Two of them are playing in the surf.boy and girl play,the hormones still a little ahead of the drugs. She's giggling,and the surf crashes slowly.It would be suicide if the enemy came every night.But the enemy does not come every night,so they run through the surf,splashing, screaming with pleasure. I got sharp ears(all the better to hear them with) and good eyes(all the better to see them with)and they're so fucking young and happy fucking I could spit. The hardest thing, for such a one as me:the gift of death should go to such as those.She screamed first. The red moon was highand just a day past full.I watched her tumble into the surf, as ifthe water were twenty feet deep, not two,as if she were being sucked under. The boy just ran,a stream of clear piss splashing from the jut in his speedos,stumbling and wailing and away. It came out of the water slowly, like a man in bad monster movie makeup.It carried the bronzed girl in its arms. I yawned,like big dogs yawn, and licked my flanks. The creature bit the girl's face off, dropped what was left on the sand,and I thought: meat and chemicals, how quickly theybecome meat and chemicals, just one bite and they'remeat and chemicals . . .Roth's men came down then with fear in their eyes,automatic weapons in their hands. It picked them upand ripped them open, dropped them on the moonlit sand. The thing walked stiffly up the beach, white sand adheringto its green-gray feet, webbed and clawed.Top of the world, Ma, it howled.What kind of mother, I thought, gives birth to something like that?And from high on the beach I could hear Roth screaming, Talbot,Talbot you asshole. Where are you? I got up and stretched and loped naked down the beach.Well, hi, I said.Hey, pooch, he said.I'm gonna rip your hairy leg off and push it down your throat.That's no way to say hi, I told him.I'm Grand Al, he said.And who are you? Jojo the yapping dog-faced boy?I'm going to whip and rip and tear you into shit. Avaunt, foul beast, I said.He stared at me with eyes that glittered like two crack pipes.Avaunt? Shit, boy. Who's going to make me?Me, I quipped. I am.I'm one of the avaunt guard.He just looked blank, and hurt, a bit confused, andfor a moment I almost felt sorry for him. And then the moon came out from behind a cloud,and I began to howl. His skin was fishskin pale,his teeth were sharp as sharks',his fingers were webbed and clawed,and, growling, he lunged for my throat. And he said, What are you?He said, Ow, no, ow.He said, Hey, shit, this isn't fair.Then he said nothing at all, not words now,no more words,because I had ripped off his armand left it,fingers spastically clutching nothing,on the beach. Grand Al ran for the waves, and I loped after him.The waves were salt: his blood stank.I could taste it, black in my mouth. He swam, and I followed, down and down,and when I felt my lungs bursting,the world crushing my throat and head and mind and chest,monsters turning to suffocate me,we came into the tumbled wreckage of an offshore oil rig,and that was where Grand Al had gone to die. This must have been the place that he was spawned,this rusting rig abandoned in the sea.He was three-quarters dead when I arrived.I left him to die: weird fishy food he would have been,a dish of stray prions. Dangerous meat. But still,I kicked him in the jaw, stole one sharklike tooththat I'd knocked loose, to bring me luck.She came upon me then, all fang and claw. Why should it be so strange that the beast had a mother?So many of us have mothers.Go back fifty years and everyone had a mother. She wailed for her son, she wailed and keened.She asked me how I could be so unkind.She squatted, stroked his face, and then she groaned.After, we spoke, hunting for common ground. What we did is no business of yours.It was no more than you or I have done before,And whether I loved her or I killed her, her son was dead asthe gulf. Rolling, pelt to scales,her neck between my teeth,my claws raking her back . . .Lalalalalala. This is the oldest song. Later I walked out of the surf.Roth was waiting in the dawn.I dropped Grand Al's head down upon the beach,fine white sand clung in clumps to the wet eyes. This was your problem, I told him.Yeah, he's dead, I said.And now? he asked.Danegeld, I told him. You think he was working for the Chinks? he asked.Or the Eurisraeli Mafia? Or who?He was a neighbor, I said. Wanted you to keep the noise down.You think? he said.I know, I told him, looking at the head.Where did he come from? asked Roth.I pulled my clothes on, tired from the change.Meat and chemicals, I whispered. He knew I lied, but wolves are born to lie.I sat down on the beach to watch the bay,stared at the sky as dawn turned into day,and daydreamed of a day when I might die.

WE CAN GET THEM
FOR YOU WHOLESALE
Peter Pinter had never heard of Aristippus of the Cyrenaics, a lesser-known follower of Socrates who maintained that the avoidance of trouble was the highest attainable good; however, he had lived his uneventful life according to this precept. In all respects except one (an inability to pass up a bargain, and which of us is entirely free from that?), he was a very moderate man. He did not go to extremes. His speech was proper and reserved; he rarely overate; he drank enough to be sociable and no more; he was far from rich and in no wise poor. He liked people and people liked him. Bearing all that in mind, would you expect to find him in a lowlife pub on the seamier side of London's East End, taking out what is colloquially known as a ""contract"" on someone he hardly knew? You would not. You would not even expect to find him in the pub.And until a certain Friday afternoon, you would have been right. But the love of a woman can do strange things to a man, even one so colorless as Peter Pinter, and the discovery that Miss Gwendolyn Thorpe, twenty-three years of age, of 9, Oaktree Terrace, Purley, was messing about (as the vulgar would put it) with a smooth young gentleman from the accounting department-after, mark you, she had consented to wear an engagement ring, composed of real ruby chips, nine-carat gold, and something that might well have been a diamond (£37.50) that it had taken Peter almost an entire lunch hour to choose-can do very strange things to a man indeed.After he made this shocking discovery, Peter spent a sleepless Friday night, tossing and turning with visions of Gwendolyn and Archie Gibbons (the Don Juan of the Clamages accounting department) dancing and swimming before his eyes-performing acts that even Peter, if he were pressed, would have to admit were most improbable. But the bile of jealousy had risen up within him, and by the morning Peter had resolved that his rival should be done away with.Saturday morning was spent wondering how one contacted an assassin, for, to the best of Peter's knowledge, none were employed by Clamages (the department store that employed all three of the members of our eternal triangle and, incidentally, furnished the ring), and he was wary of asking anyone outright for fear of attracting attention to himself.Thus it was that Saturday afternoon found him hunting through the Yellow Pages.ASSASSINS, he found, was not between ASPHALT CONTRACTORS and ASSESSORS (QUANTITY); KILLERS was not between KENNELS and KINDERGARTENS; MURDERERS was not between MOWERS and MUSEUMS. PEST CONTROL looked promising; however closer investigation of the pest control advertisements showed them to be almost solely concerned with ""rats, mice, fleas, cockroaches, rabbits, moles, and rats"" (to quote from one that Peter felt was rather hard on rats) and not really what he had in mind. Even so, being of a careful nature, he dutifully inspected the entries in that category, and at the bottom of the second page, in small print, he found a firm that looked promising.'Complete discreet disposal of irksome and unwanted mammals, etc.' went the entry, 'Ketch, Hare, Burke and Ketch. The Old Firm.' It went on to give no address, but only a telephone number.Peter dialed the number, surprising himself by so doing. His heart pounded in his chest, and he tried to look nonchalant. The telephone rang once, twice, three times. Peter was just starting to hope that it would not be answered and he could forget the whole thing when there was a click and a brisk young female voice said, ""Ketch Hare Burke Ketch. Can I help you?""Carefully not giving his name, Peter said, ""Er, how big-I mean, what size mammals do you go up to? To, uh, dispose of?""""Well, that would all depend on what size sir requires.""He plucked up all his courage. ""A person?""Her voice remained brisk and unruffled. ""Of course, sir. Do you have a pen and paper handy? Good. Be at the Dirty Donkey pub, off Little Courtney Street, E3, tonight at eight o'clock. Carry a rolled-up copy of the Financial Times-that's the pink one, sir-and our operative will approach you there."" Then she put down the phone.Peter was elated. It had been far easier than he had imagined. He went down to the newsagent's and bought a copy of the Financial Times, found Little Courtney Street in his A-Z of London, and spent the rest of the afternoon watching football on the television and imagining the smooth young gentleman from accounting's funeral. It took Peter a while to find the pub. Eventually he spotted the pub sign, which showed a donkey and was indeed remarkably dirty.The Dirty Donkey was a small and more or less filthy pub, poorly lit, in which knots of unshaven people wearing dusty donkey jackets stood around eyeing each other suspiciously, eating crisps and drinking pints of Guinness, a drink that Peter had never cared for. Peter held his Financial Times under one arm as conspicuously as he could, but no one approached him, so he bought a half of shandy and retreated to a corner table. Unable to think of anything else to do while waiting, he tried to read the paper, but, lost and confused by a maze of grain futures and a rubber company that was selling something or other short (quite what the short somethings were he could not tell), he gave it up and stared at the door.He had waited almost ten minutes when a small busy man hustled in, looked quickly around him, then came straight over to Peter's table and sat down.He stuck out his hand. ""Kemble. Burton Kemble of Ketch Hare Burke Ketch. I hear you have a job for us.""He didn't look like a killer. Peter said so.""Oh, lor' bless us, no. I'm not actually part of our workforce, sir. I'm in sales.""Peter nodded. That certainly made sense. ""Can we-er-talk freely here?""""Sure. Nobody's interested. Now then, how many people would you like disposed of?""""Only one. His name's Archibald Gibbons and he works in Clamages accounting department. His address is . . . ""Kemble interrupted. ""We can go into all that later, sir, if you don't mind. Let's just quickly go over the financial side. First of all, the contract will cost you five hundred pounds . . . ""Peter nodded. He could afford that and in fact had expected to have to pay a little more."". . . although there's always the special offer,"" Kemble concluded smoothly.Peter's eyes shone. As I mentioned earlier, he loved a bargain and often bought things he had no imaginable use for in sales or on special offers. Apart from this one failing (one that so many of us share), he was a most moderate young man. ""Special offer?""""Two for the price of one, sir.""Mmm. Peter thought about it. That worked out at only £250 each, which couldn't be bad no matter how you looked at it. There was only one snag. ""I'm afraid I don't have anyone else I want killed.""Kemble looked disappointed. ""That's a pity, sir. For two we could probably have even knocked the price down to, well, say four hundred and fifty pounds for the both of them.""""Really?""""Well, it gives our operatives something to do, sir. If you must know""-and here he dropped his voice-""there really isn't enough work in this particular line to keep them occupied. Not like the old days. Isn't there just one other person you'd like to see dead?""Peter pondered. He hated to pass up a bargain, but couldn't for the life of him think of anyone else. He liked people. Still, a bargain was a bargain . . .""Look,"" said Peter. ""Could I think about it and see you here tomorrow night?""The salesman looked pleased. ""Of course, sir,"" he said. ""I'm sure you'll be able to think of someone.""The answer-the obvious answer-came to Peter as he was drifting off to sleep that night. He sat straight up in bed, fumbled the bedside light on, and wrote a name down on the back of an envelope, in case he forgot it. To tell the truth, he didn't think that he could forget it, for it was painfully obvious, but you can never tell with these late-night thoughts.The name that he had written down on the back of the envelope was this: Gwendolyn Thorpe.He turned the light off, rolled over, and was soon asleep, dreaming peaceful and remarkably unmurderous dreams. Kemble was waiting for him when he arrived in the Dirty Donkey on Sunday night. Peter bought a drink and sat down beside him.""I'm taking you up on the special offer,"" he said by way of greeting.Kemble nodded vigorously. ""A very wise decision, if you don't mind me saying so, sir.""Peter Pinter smiled modestly, in the manner of one who read the Financial Times and made wise business decisions. ""That will be four hundred and fifty pounds, I believe?""""Did I say four hundred and fifty pounds, sir? Good gracious me, I do apologize. I beg your pardon, I was thinking of our bulk rate. It would be four hundred and seventy-five pounds for two people.""Disappointment mingled with cupidity on Peter's bland and youthful face. That was an extra £25. However, something that Kemble had said caught his attention.""Bulk rate?""""Of course, but I doubt that sir would be interested in that.""""No, no, I am. Tell me about it.""""Very well, sir. Bulk rate, four hundred and fifty pounds, would be for a large job. Ten people.""Peter wondered if he had heard correctly. ""Ten people? But that's only forty-five pounds each.""""Yes, sir. It's the large order that makes it profitable.""""I see,"" said Peter, and ""Hmm,"" said Peter, and ""Could you be here the same time tomorrow night?""""Of course, sir.""Upon arriving homes, Peter got out a scrap of paper and a pen. He wrote the numbers one to ten down one side and then filled it in as follows:1 . . . Archie G.2 . . . Gwennie.3 . . .and so forth.Having filled in the first two, he sat sucking his pen, hunting for wrongs done to him and people the world would be better off without.He smoked a cigarette. He strolled around the room.Aha! There was a physics teacher at a school he had attended who had delighted in making his life a misery. What was the man's name again? And for that matter, was he still alive? Peter wasn't sure, but he wrote The Physics Teacher, Abbot Street Secondary School next to the number three. The next came more easily-his department head had refused to raise his salary a couple of months back; that the raise had eventually come was immaterial. Mr. Hunterson was number four.When he was five, a boy named Simon Ellis had poured paint on his head while another boy named James somebody-or-other had held him down and a girl named Sharon Hartsharpe had laughed. They were numbers five through seven, respectively.Who else?There was the man on television with the annoying snicker who read the news. He went on the list. And what about the woman in the flat next door with the little yappy dog that shat in the hall? He put her and the dog down on nine. Ten was the hardest. He scratched his head and went into the kitchen for a cup of coffee, then dashed back and wrote My Great-Uncle Mervyn down in the tenth place. The old man was rumored to be quite affluent, and there was a possibility (albeit rather slim) that he could leave Peter some money.With the satisfaction of an evening's work well done, he went off to bed.Monday at Clamages was routine; Peter was a senior sales assistant in the books department, a job that actually entailed very little. He clutched his list tightly in his hand, deep in his pocket, rejoicing in the feeling of power that it gave him. He spent a most enjoyable lunch hour in the canteen with young Gwendolyn (who did not know that he had seen her and Archie enter the stockroom together) and even smiled at the smooth young man from the accounting department when he passed him in the corridor.He proudly displayed his list to Kemble that evening.The little salesman's face fell.""I'm afraid this isn't ten people, Mr. Pinter,"" he explained.""You've counted the woman in the next-door flat and her dog as one person. That brings it to eleven, which would be an extra""-his pocket calculator was rapidly deployed-""an extra seventy pounds. How about if we forget the dog?""Peter shook his head. ""The dog's as bad as the woman. Or worse.""""Then I'm afraid we have a slight problem. Unless . . . """"What?""""Unless you'd like to take advantage of our wholesale rate. But of course sir wouldn't be . . . ""There are words that do things to people; words that make people's faces flush with joy, excitement, or passion. Environmental can be one; occult is another. Wholesale was Peter's. He leaned back in his chair. ""Tell me about it,"" he said with the practiced assurance of an experienced shopper.""Well, sir,"" said Kemble, allowing himself a little chuckle, ""we can, uh, get them for you wholesale, seventeen pounds fifty each, for every quarry after the first fifty, or a tenner each for every one over two hundred.""""I suppose you'd go down to a fiver if I wanted a thousand people knocked off?""""Oh no, sir,"" Kemble looked shocked. ""If you're talking those sorts of figures, we can do them for a quid each.""""One pound?""""That's right, sir. There's not a big profit margin on it, but the high turnover and productivity more than justifies it.""Kemble got up. ""Same time tomorrow, sir?""Peter nodded.One thousand pounds. One thousand people. Peter Pinter didn't even know a thousand people. Even so . . . there were the Houses of Parliament. He didn't like politicians; they squabbled and argued and carried on so.And for that matter . . .An idea, shocking in its audacity. Bold. Daring. Still, the idea was there and it wouldn't go away. A distant cousin of his had married the younger brother of an earl or a baron or something . . .On the way home from work that afternoon, he stopped off at a little shop that he had passed a thousand times without entering. It had a large sign in the window-guaranteeing to trace your lineage for you and even draw up a coat of arms if you happened to have mislaid your own-and an impressive heraldic map.They were very helpful and phoned him up just after seven to give him their news.If approximately fourteen million, seventy-two thousand, eight hundred and eleven people died, he, Peter Pinter, would be King of England.He didn't have fourteen million, seventy-two thousand, eight hundred and eleven pounds: but he suspected that when you were talking in those figures, Mr. Kemble would have one of his special discounts. Mr. Kemble did.He didn't even raise an eyebrow.""Actually,"" he explained, ""it works out quite cheaply; you see, we wouldn't have to do them all individually. Small-scale nuclear weapons, some judicious bombing, gassing, plague, dropping radios in swimming pools, and then mopping up the stragglers. Say four thousand pounds.""""Four thou-? That's incredible!""The salesman looked pleased with himself. ""Our operatives will be glad of the work, sir."" He grinned. ""We pride ourselves on servicing our wholesale customers.""The wind blew cold as Peter left the pub, setting the old sign swinging. It didn't look much like a dirty donkey, thought Peter. More like a pale horse.Peter was drifting off to sleep that night, mentally rehearsing his coronation speech, when a thought drifted into his head and hung around. It would not go away. Could he-could he possibly be passing up an even larger saving than he already had? Could he be missing out on a bargain?Peter climbed out of bed and walked over to the phone. It was almost 3 A.M., but even so . . .His Yellow Pages lay open where he had left it the previous Saturday, and he dialed the number.The phone seemed to ring forever. There was a click and a bored voice said, ""Burke Hare Ketch. Can I help you?""""I hope I'm not phoning too late . . . "" he began.""Of course not, sir.""""I was wondering if I could speak to Mr. Kemble.""""Can you hold? I'll see if he's available.""Peter waited for a couple of minutes, listening to the ghostly crackles and whispers that always echo down empty phone lines.""Are you there, caller?""""Yes, I'm here.""""Putting you through."" There was a buzz, then ""Kemble speaking.""""Ah, Mr. Kemble. Hello. Sorry if I got you out of bed or anything. This is, um, Peter Pinter.""""Yes, Mr. Pinter?""""Well, I'm sorry it's so late, only I was wondering . . . How much would it cost to kill everybody? Everybody in the world?""""Everybody? All the people?""""Yes. How much? I mean, for an order like that, you'd have to have some kind of a big discount. How much would it be? For everyone?""""Nothing at all, Mr. Pinter.""""You mean you wouldn't do it?""""I mean we'd do it for nothing, Mr. Pinter. We only have to be asked, you see. We always have to be asked.""Peter was puzzled. ""But-when would you start?""""Start? Right away. Now. We've been ready for a long time. But we had to be asked, Mr. Pinter. Good night. It has been a pleasure doing business with you.""The line went dead.Peter felt strange. Everything seemed very distant. He wanted to sit down. What on earth had the man meant? ""We always have to be asked."" It was definitely strange. Nobody does anything for nothing in this world; he had a good mind to phone Kemble back and call the whole thing off. Perhaps he had overreacted, perhaps there was a perfectly innocent reason why Archie and Gwendolyn had entered the stockroom together. He would talk to her; that's what he'd do. He'd talk to Gwennie first thing tomorrow morning . . .That was when the noises started.Odd cries from across the street. A catfight? Foxes probably. He hoped someone would throw a shoe at them. Then, from the corridor outside his flat, he heard a muffled clumping, as if someone were dragging something very heavy along the floor. It stopped. Someone knocked on his door, twice, very softly.Outside his window the cries were getting louder. Peter sat in his chair, knowing that somehow, somewhere, he had missed something. Something important. The knocking redoubled. He was thankful that he always locked and chained his door at night.They'd been ready for a long time, but they had to be asked. . . When the thing came through the door, Peter started screaming, but he really didn't scream for very long.

ONE LIFE, FURNISHED IN EARLY MOORCOCK
The Pale albino prince lofted on high his great black sword ""This is Stormbringer"" he said ""and it will suck your soul right out.""The Princess sighed. ""Very well!"" she said. ""If that is what you need to get the energy you need to fight the Dragon Warriors, then you must kill me and let your broad sword feed on my soul.""""I do not want to do this"" he said to her.""That's okay"" said the princess and with that she ripped her flimsy gown and beared her chest to him. ""That is my heart"" she said, pointing with her finger. ""and that is where you must plunge.""He had never got any farther than that. That had been the day he had been told he was being moved up a year, and there hadn't been much point after that. He'd learned not to try and continue stories from one year to another. Now, he was twelve.It was a pity, though.The essay title had been ""Meeting My Favorite Literary Character,"" and he'd picked Elric. He'd toyed with Corum, or Jerry Cornelius, or even Conan the Barbarian, but Elric of Melnibone won, hands down, just like he always did.Richard had first read Stormbringer three years ago, at the age of nine. He'd saved up for a copy of The Singing Citadel (something of a cheat, he decided, on finishing: only one Elric story) and then borrowed the money from his father to buy The Sleeping Sorceress, found in a spin rack while they were on holiday in Scotland last summer. In The Sleeping Sorceress Elric met Erikose and Corum, two other aspects of the Eternal Champion, and they all got together.Which meant, he realized when he finished the book, that the Corum books and the Erikose books and even the Dorian Hawkmoon books were really Elric books, too, so he began buying them, and he enjoyed them.They weren't as good as Elric, though. Elric was the best.Sometimes he'd sit and draw Elric, trying to get him right. None of the paintings of Elric on the covers of the books looked like the Elric that lived in his head. He drew the Elrics with a fountain pen in empty school exercise books he had obtained by deceit. On the front cover he'd write his name: RICHARD GREY. DO NOT STEAL.Sometimes he thought he ought to go back and finish writing his Elric story. Maybe he could even sell it to a magazine. But then, what if Moorcock found out? What if he got into trouble?The classroom was large, filled with wooden desks. Each desk was carved and scored and ink-stained by its occupant, an important process. There was a blackboard on the wall with a chalk drawing on it: a fairly accurate representation of a male penis, heading towards a Y shape, intended to represent the female genitalia.The door downstairs banged, and someone ran up the stairs. ""Grey, you spazmo, what're you doing up here? We're meant to be down on the Lower Acre. You're playing football today.""""We are? I am?""""It was announced at assembly this morning. And the list is up on the games notice board."" J.B.C. MacBride was sandy-haired, bespectacled, only marginally more organized than Richard Grey. There were two J. MacBrides, which was how he ranked a full set of initials.""Oh.""Grey picked up a book (Tarzan at the Earth's Core) and headed off after him. The clouds were dark gray, promising rain or snow.People were forever announcing things he didn't notice. He would arrive in empty classes, miss organized games, arrive at school on days when everyone else had gone home. Sometimes he felt as if he lived in a different world to everyone else.He went off to play football, Tarzan at the Earth's Core shoved down the back of his scratchy blue football shorts.He hated the showers and the baths. He couldn't understand why they had to use both, but that was just the way it was.He was freezing, and no good at games. It was beginning to become a matter of perverse pride with him that in his years at the school so far, he hadn't scored a goal, or hit a run, or bowled anyone out, or done anything much except be the last person to be picked when choosing sides.Elric, proud pale prince of the Melniboneans, would never have had to stand around on a football pitch in the middle of winter, wishing the game would be over.Steam from the shower room, and his inner thighs were chapped and red. The boys stood naked and shivering in a line, waiting to get under the showers and then to get into the baths.Mr. Murchison, eyes wild and face leathery and wrinkled, old and almost bald, stood in the changing rooms directing naked boys into the shower, then out of the shower and into the baths. ""You boy. Silly little boy. Jamieson. Into the shower, Jamieson. Atkinson, you baby, get under it properly. Smiggins, into the bath. Goring, take his place in the shower . . . "" The showers were too hot. The baths were freezing cold and muddy.When Mr. Murchison wasn't around, boys would flick each other with towels, joke about each others' penises, about who had pubic hair, who didn't.""Don't be an idiot,"" hissed someone near Richard. ""What if the Murch comes back. He'll kill you."" There was some nervous giggling.Richard turned and looked. An older boy had an erection, was rubbing his hand up and down it slowly under the shower, displaying it proudly to the room.Richard turned away.Forgery was too easy.Richard could do a passable imitation of the Murch's signature, for example, and an excellent version of his housemaster's handwriting and signature. His housemaster was a tall, bald, dry man named Trellis. They had disliked each other for years.Richard used the signatures to get blank exercise books from the stationery office, which dispensed paper, pencils, pens, and rulers on the production of a note signed by a teacher.Richard wrote stories and poems and drew pictures in the exercise books.After the bath, Richard toweled himself off and dressed hurriedly; he had a book to get back to, a lost world to return to.He walked out of the building slowly, tie askew, shirttail flapping, reading about Lord Greystoke, wondering whether there really was a world inside the world where dinosaurs flew and it was never night.The daylight was beginning to go, but there were still a number of boys outside the school, playing with tennis balls: a couple played conkers by the bench. Richard leaned against the redbrick wall and read, the outside world closed off, the indignities of changing rooms forgotten.""You're a disgrace, Grey.""Me?""Look at you. Your tie's all crooked. You're a disgrace to the school. That's what you are.""The boy's name was Lindfield, two school years above him, but already as big as an adult. ""Look at your tie. I mean, look at it."" Lindfield pulled at Richard's green tie, pulled it tight into a hard little knot. ""Pathetic.""Lindfield and his friends wandered off.Elric of Melnibone was standing by the redbrick walls of the school building, staring at him. Richard pulled at the knot in his tie, trying to loosen it. It was cutting into his throat.His hands fumbled around his neck.He couldn't breathe; but he was not concerned about breathing. He was worried about standing. Richard had suddenly forgotten how to stand. It was a relief to discover how soft the brick path he was standing on had become as it slowly came up to embrace him.They were standing together under a night sky hung with a thousand huge stars, by the ruins of what might once have been an ancient temple.Elric's ruby eyes stared down at him. They looked, Richard thought, like the eyes of a particularly vicious white rabbit that Richard had once had, before it gnawed through the wire of the cage and fled into the Sussex countryside to terrify innocent foxes. His skin was perfectly white; his armor, ornate and elegant, traced with intricate patterns, perfectly black. His fine white hair blew about his shoulders as if in a breeze, but the air was still.-So you want to be a companion to heroes? he asked. His voice was gentler than Richard had imagined it would be.Richard nodded.Elric put one long finger beneath Richard's chin, lifted his face up. Blood eyes, thought Richard. Blood eyes.-You're no companion, boy, he said in the High Speech of Melnibone.Richard had always known he would understand the High Speech when he heard it, even if his Latin and French had always been weak.- Well, what am I, then? he asked. Please tell me. Please?Elric made no response. He walked away from Richard, into the ruined temple.Richard ran after him.Inside the temple Richard found a life waiting for him, all ready to be worn and lived, and inside that life, another. Each life he tried on, he slipped into and it pulled him farther in, farther away from the world he came from; one by one, existence following existence, rivers of dreams and fields of stars, a hawk with a sparrow clutched in its talons flies low above the grass, and here are tiny intricate people waiting for him to fill their heads with life, and thousands of years pass and he is engaged in strange work of great importance and sharp beauty, and he is loved, and he is honored, and then a pull, a sharp tug, and it's . . .. . . it was like coming up from the bottom of the deep end of a swimming pool. Stars appeared above him and dropped away and dissolved into blues and greens, and it was with a deep sense of disappointment that he became Richard Grey and came to himself once more, filled with an unfamiliar emotion. The emotion was a specific one, so specific that he was surprised, later, to realize that it did not have its own name: a feeling of disgust and regret at having to return to something he had thought long since done with and abandoned and forgotten and dead.Richard was lying on the ground, and Lindfield was pulling at the tiny knot of his tie. There were other boys around, faces staring down at him, worried, concerned, scared.Lindfield pulled the tie loose. Richard struggled to pull air, he gulped it, clawed it into his lungs.""We thought you were faking. You just went over."" Someone said that.""Shut up,"" said Lindfield. ""Are you all right? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Christ. I'm sorry.""For one moment, Richard thought he was apologizing for having called him back from the world beyond the temple.Lindfield was terrified, solicitous, desperately worried. He had obviously never almost killed anyone before. As he walked Richard up the stone steps to the matron's office, Lindfield explained that he had returned from the school tuck-shop, found Richard unconscious on the path, surrounded by curious boys, and had realized what was wrong. Richard rested for a little in the matron's office, where he was given a bitter soluble aspirin, from a huge jar, in a plastic tumbler of water, then was shown in to the headmaster's study.""God, but you look scruffy, Grey!"" said the headmaster, puffing irritably on his pipe. ""I don't blame young Lindfield at all. Anyway, he saved your life. I don't want to hear another word about it.""""I'm sorry,"" said Grey.""That will be all,"" said the headmaster in his cloud of scented smoke.""Have you picked a religion yet?"" asked the school chaplain, Mr. Aliquid.Richard shook his head. ""I've got quite a few to choose from,"" he admitted.The school chaplain was also Richard's biology teacher. He had recently taken Richard's biology class, fifteen thirteen-year-old boys and Richard, just twelve, across the road to his little house opposite the school. In the garden Mr. Aliquid had killed, skinned, and dismembered a rabbit with a small sharp knife. Then he'd taken a foot pump and blown up the rabbit's bladder like a balloon until it had popped, spattering the boys with blood. Richard threw up, but he was the only one who did.""Hm,"" said the chaplain.The chaplain's study was lined with books. It was one of the few masters' studies that was in any way comfortable.""What about masturbation? Are you masturbating excessively?"" Mr. Aliquid's eyes gleamed.""What's excessively?""""Oh. More than three or four times a day, I suppose.""""No,"" said Richard. ""Not excessively.""He was a year younger than anyone else in his class; people forgot about that sometimes.Every weekend he traveled to North London to stay with his cousins for bar mitzvah lessons taught by a thin ascetic cantor, frummer than frum, a cabalist and keeper of hidden mysteries onto which he could be diverted with a well-placed question. Richard was an expert at well-placed questions.Frum was orthodox, hard-line Jewish. No milk with meat, and two washing machines for the two sets of plates and cutlery.Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk.Richard's cousins in North London were frum, although the boys would secretly buy cheeseburgers after school and brag about it to each other.Richard suspected his body was hopelessly polluted already. He drew the line at eating rabbit, though. He had eaten rabbit, and disliked it, for years before he figured out what it was. Every Thursday there was what he believed to be a rather unpleasant chicken stew for school lunch. One Thursday he found a rabbit's paw floating in his stew, and the penny dropped. After that on Thursdays, he filled up on bread and butter.On the underground train to North London, he'd scan the faces of the other passengers, wondering if any of them were Michael Moorcock.If he met Moorcock, he'd ask him how to get back to the ruined temple.If he met Moorcock, he'd be too embarrassed to speak.Some nights when his parents were out, he'd try to phone Michael Moorcock.He'd phone directory enquiries and ask for Moorcock's number.""Can't give it to you, love. It's ex-directory.""He'd wheedle and cajole, and always fail, to his relief. He didn't know what he would say to Moorcock if he succeeded.He put ticks in the front of his Moorcock novels, on the By the Same Author page, for the books he read.That year there seemed to be a new Moorcock book every week. He'd pick them up at Victoria station on the way to bar mitzvah lessons.There were a few he simply couldn't find-Stealer of Souls, Breakfast in the Ruins-and eventually, nervously, he ordered them from the address in the back of the books. He got his father to write him a check.When the books arrived, they contained a bill for 25 pence: the prices of the books were higher than originally listed. But still, he now had a copy of Stealer of Souls and a copy of Breakfast in the Ruins.At the back of Breakfast in the Ruins was a biography of Moorcock that said he'd died of lung cancer the year before.Richard was upset for weeks. That meant there wouldn't be any more books, ever.That fucking biography. Shortly after it came out, I was at a Hawkwind gig, stoned out of my brain, and these people kept coming up to me, and I thought I was dead. They kept saying, ""You're dead, you're dead."" Later I realized that they were saying, ""But we thought you were dead."" -Michael Moorcock, in conversation, Notting Hill, 1976There was the Eternal Champion, and then there was the Companion to Champions. Moonglum was Elric's companion, always cheerful, the perfect foil to the pale prince, who was prey to moods and depressions.There was a multiverse out there, glittering and magic. There were the agents of balance, the Gods of Chaos, and the Lords of Order. There were the older races, tall, pale, and elfin, and the young kingdoms, filled with people like him. Stupid, boring, normal people.Sometimes he hoped that Elric could find peace away from the black sword. But it didn't work that way. There had to be the both of them-the white prince and the black sword.Once the sword was unsheathed, it lusted for blood, needed to be plunged into quivering flesh. Then it would drain the soul from the victim, feed his or her energy into Elric's feeble frame.Richard was becoming obsessed with sex; he had even had a dream in which he was having sex with a girl. Just before waking, he dreamed what it must be like to have an orgasm-it was an intense and magical feeling of love, centered on your heart; that was what it was, in his dream.A feeling of deep, transcendent, spiritual bliss.Nothing he experienced ever matched up to that dream.Nothing even came close.The Karl Glogauer in Behold the Man was not the Karl Glogauer of Breakfast in the Ruins, Richard decided; still, it gave him an odd, blasphemous pride to read Breakfast in the Ruins in the school chapel in the choir stalls. As long as he was discreet no one seemed to care.He was the boy with the book. Always and forever.His head swam with religions: the weekend was now given to the intricate patterns and language of Judaism; each weekday morning to the wood-scented, stained-glass solemnities of the Church of England; and the nights belonged to his own religion, the one he made up for himself, a strange, multicolored pantheon in which the Lords of Chaos (Arioch, Xiombarg, and the rest) rubbed shoulders with the Phantom Stranger from the DC Comics and Sam the trickster-Buddha from Zelazny's Lord of Light, and vampires and talking cats and ogres, and all the things from the Lang colored Fairy books: in which all mythologies existed simultaneously in a magnificent anarchy of belief.Richard had, however, finally given up (with, it must be admitted, a little regret) his belief in Narnia. From the age of six-for half his life-he had believed devoutly in all things Narnian; until, last year, rereading The Voyage of the Dawn Treader for perhaps the hundredth time, it had occurred to him that the transformation of the unpleasant Eustace Scrub into a dragon and his subsequent conversion to belief in Aslan the lion was terribly similar to the conversion of St. Paul on the road to Damascus; if his blindness were a dragon . . .This having occurred to him, Richard found correspondences everywhere, too many to be simple coincidence.Richard put away the Narnia books, convinced, sadly, that they were allegory; that an author (whom he had trusted) had been attempting to slip something past him. He had had the same disgust with the Professor Challenger stories, when the bull-necked old professor became a convert to Spiritualism; it was not that Richard had any problems with believing in ghosts-Richard believed, with no problems or contradictions, in everything-but Conan Doyle was preaching, and it showed through the words. Richard was young, and innocent in his fashion, and believed that authors should be trusted, and that there should be nothing hidden beneath the surface of a story.At least the Elric stories were honest. There was nothing going on beneath the surface there: Elric was the etiolated prince of a dead race, burning with self-pity, clutching Stormbringer, his dark-bladed broadsword-a blade which sang for lives, which ate human souls, and which gave their strength to the doomed and weakened albino.Richard read and reread the Elric stories, and he felt pleasure each time Stormbringer plunged into an enemy's chest, somehow felt a sympathetic satisfaction as Elric drew his strength from the soul-sword, like a heroin addict in a paperback thriller with a fresh supply of smack.Richard was convinced that one day the people from Mayflower Books would come after him for their 25 pence. He never dared buy any more books through the mail.J.B.C. MacBride had a secret.""You mustn't tell anyone.""""Okay.""Richard had no problem with the idea of keeping secrets. In later years he realized that he was a walking repository of old secrets, secrets that his original confidants had probably long forgotten.They were walking, with their arms over each other's shoulders, up to the woods at the back of the school.Richard had, unasked, been gifted with another secret in these woods: it is here that three of Richard's school friends have meetings with girls from the village and where, he has been told, they display to each other their genitalia.""I can't tell you who told me any of this.""""Okay,"" said Richard.""I mean, it's true. And it's a deadly secret.""""Fine.""MacBride had been spending a lot of time recently with Mr. Aliquid, the school chaplain.""Well, everybody has two angels. God gives them one and Satan gives them one. So when you get hypnotized, Satan's angel takes control. And that's how Ouija boards work. It's Satan's angel. And you can implore your God's angel to talk through you. But real enlightenment only occurs when you can talk to your angel. He tells you secrets.""This was the first time that it had occurred to Grey that the Church of England might have its own esoterica, its own hidden cabala.The other boy blinked owlishly. ""You mustn't tell anyone that. I'd get into trouble if they knew I'd told you.""""Fine.""There was a pause.""Have you ever wanked off a grown-up?"" asked MacBride.""No."" Richard's own secret was that he had not yet begun to masturbate. All of his friends masturbated, continually, alone and in pairs or groups. He was a year younger than them and couldn't understand what the fuss was about; the whole idea made him uncomfortable.""Spunk everywhere. It's thick and oozy. They try to get you to put their cocks in your mouth when they shoot off.""""Eugh.""""It's not that bad."" There was a pause. ""You know, Mr. Aliquid thinks you're very clever. If you wanted to join his private religious discussion group, he might say yes.""The private discussion group met at Mr. Aliquid's small bachelor house across the road from the school in the evenings, twice a week after prep.""I'm not Christian.""""So? You still come top of the class in Divinity, Jewboy.""""No thanks. Hey, I got a new Moorcock. One you haven't read. It's an Elric book.""""You haven't. There isn't a new one.""""Is. It's called The Jade Man's Eyes. It's printed in green ink. I found it in a bookshop in Brighton.""""Can I borrow it after you?""""Course.""It was getting chilly, and they walked back, arm in arm. Like Elric and Moonglum, thought Richard to himself, and it made as much sense as MacBride's angels.Richard had daydreams in which he would kidnap Michael Moorcock and make him tell Richard the secret.If pushed, Richard would be unable to tell you what kind of thing the secret was. It was something to do with writing; something to do with gods.Richard wondered where Moorcock got his ideas from.Probably from the ruined temple, he decided, in the end, although he could no longer remember what the temple looked like. He remembered a shadow, and stars, and the feeling of pain at returning to something he thought long finished.He wondered if that was where all authors got their ideas from or just Michael Moorcock.If you had told him that they just made it all up, out of their heads, he would never have believed you. There had to be a place the magic came from.Didn't there?This bloke phoned me up from America the other night, he said, ""Listen, man, I have to talk to you about your religion."" I said, ""I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't got any fucking religion."" -Michael Moorcock, in conversation, Notting Hill, 1976It was six months later. Richard had been bar mitzvahed and would be changing schools soon. He and J.B.C. MacBride were sitting on the grass outside the school in the early evening, reading books. Richard's parents were late picking him up from school.Richard was reading The English Assassin. MacBride was engrossed in The Devil Rides Out.Richard found himself squinting at the page. It wasn't properly dark yet, but he couldn't read anymore. Everything was turning into grays.""Mac? What do you want to be when you grow up?""The evening was warm, and the grass was dry and comfortable.""I don't know. A writer, maybe. Like Michael Moorcock. Or T.H. White. How about you?""Richard sat and thought. The sky was a violet-gray, and a ghost moon hung high in it, like a sliver of a dream. He pulled up a blade of grass and slowly shredded it between his fingers, bit by bit. He couldn't say ""A writer"" as well now. It would seem like he was copying. And he didn't want to be a writer. Not really. There were other things to be.""When I grow up,"" he said, pensively, eventually, ""I want to be a wolf.""""It'll never happen,"" said MacBride.""Maybe not,"" said Richard. ""We'll see.""The lights went on in the school windows, one by one, making the violet sky seem darker than it was before, and the summer evening was gentle and quiet. At that time of year, the day lasts forever, and the night never really comes.""I'd like to be a wolf. Not all the time. Just sometimes. In the dark. I would run through the forests as a wolf at night,"" said Richard, mostly to himself. ""I'd never hurt anyone. Not that kind of wolf. I'd just run and run forever in the moonlight, through the trees, and never get tired or out of breath, and never have to stop. That's what I want to be when I grow up . . . "" He pulled up another long stalk of grass, expertly stripped the blades from it, and slowly began to chew the stem.And the two children sat alone in the gray twilight, side by side, and waited for the future to start.

COLD COLORS
I.Woken at nine o'clock by the postman,who turns out not to be the postman but an itinerant seller of pigeons,crying,""Fat pigeons, pure pigeons, dove white, slate gray,living, breathing pigeons,none of your reanimated muck here, sir."" I have pigeons and to spare and I tell him so.He tells me he's new in this business,used to be part of a moderately successfulfinancial securities analysis companybut was laid off, replaced by a computer RS232'd to a quartz sphere. ""Still, mustn't grumble, one door opens, another one slams,got to keep up with the times, sir, got to keep up with the times.""He thrusts me a free pigeon(To attract new custom, sir,once you've tried one of our pigeons, you'll never look at another)and struts down the stairs, singing,""Pigeons alive-oh, alive alive-oh."" Ten o'clock after I've bathed and shaved(unguents of eternal youth and of certain sexual attraction applied from plastic vessels)I take the pigeon into my study;I refresh the chalk circle around my old Dell 310,hang wards at each corner of the monitor, and do what is needful with the pigeon. Then I turn the computer to on: It chugs and hums,inside it fans blow like storm winds on old oceansready to drown poor merchantmen.Autoexec complete it bleeps:I'll do, I'll do, I'll do . . .II.Two o'clock and walking through familiar London-or what was familiar London before the cursor deleted certain certainties-I watch a suit and tie man giving suckto the Psion Organizer lodged in his breast pocket,its serial interface like a cool mouth hunting his chest for sustenance,familiar feeling, and I'm watching my breath steam in the air. Cold as a witch's tit these days is London,you'd never think it was November,and from underground the sounds of trains rumble.Mysterious: tube trains are almost legendary in these times,stopping only for virgins and the pure of heart,first stop Avalon, Lyonesse, or the Isles of the Blessed. Maybeyou get a postcard and maybe you don't.Anyway, looking down any chasm demonstrates conclusivelythere is no room under London for subways;I warm my hands at a pit.Flames lick upward. Far below a smiling demon spots me, waves, mouths carefully,as one does to the deaf, or distant, or to foreigners.Its sales performance is spotless: It mines a Dwarrow Clone,mimes software beyond my wildest,Albertus Magnus ARChived on three floppies,Claviculae Solomon for VGA, CGA, four-color or monochrome,mimesand mimesand mimes. The tourists lean over the riftways to Hell,staring at the damned(perhaps the worst part of damnation;eternal torture is bearable in noble silence, alone,but an audience, eating crisps and chips and chestnuts,an audience who aren't even really that interested . . .They must feel like something at the zoo,the damned). Pigeons flutter around Hell, dancing on the updrafts,race memory perhaps telling themthat somewhere around here there should be four lions,unfrozen water, one stone man above;the tourists cluster around.One does a deal with the demon: a ten-pack of blank floppies for his soul.One has recognized a relative in the flames and is waving:Coooee! Coooeee! Uncle Joseph! Look, Nerissa, it's your Great-Uncle Joethat died before you was born,that's him down there, in the Slough, up to his eyes in boiling scumwith the worms crawling in and out of his face.Such a lovely man.We all cried at his funeral.Wave to your uncle, Nerissa, wave to your uncle. The pigeon man lays limed twigs on the cracked paving stones,then sprinkles breadcrumbs and waits.He raises his cap to me.""This morning's pigeon, sir, I trust it was satisfactory?""I allow that it was and toss him a golden shilling(which he touches surreptitiously to the iron of his gauntlet,checking for fairy gold, then palms). Tuesdays, I tell him. Come on Tuesdays.III.Bird-legged cottages and huts crowd the London streets,stepping spindly over the taxis, shitting embers over cyclists,queuing in the streets behind the buses,chuckchuckchuckchuckchuurck, they murmur.Old women with iron teeth gaze out of the windows,then return to their magic mirrors,or to their housework,Hoovering through fog and filthy air.IV.Four o'clock in Old Soho,rapidly becoming a backwater of lost technology.The ratcheting grate of charms being wound upwith clockwork silver keysgrinds out from every backstreet Watchmaker's,Abortionist's, Philtre & Tobacconist's. It's raining. Bulletin board kids drive pimpmobiles in floppy hats,modem pandersanoracked kid-kings of signal to noise;and all their neon-lit stippled stable flirting and turning under the lights,succubi and incubi with sell-by dates and Smart Card eyes,all yours, if you've got your number,know your expiry date, all that.One of them winks at me(flashes on, on-off, off-off-on),noise swallows signal in fumbled fellatio.(I cross two fingers,a binary precaution against hex,effective as superconductor or simple superstition.)Two poltergeists share a take-away. Old Soho always makes me nervous. Brewer Street. A hiss from an alley: Mephistopheles opens his brown coat,flashes me the lining (databased old invocations,Magians lay ghosts-with diagrams), curses, and begins:Blight an enemy?Wither a harvest?Barren a consort?Debase an innocent?Ruin a party . . . ?For you, sir? No, sir? Reconsider, I beg you.Just a little of your blood smudged on this printoutand you can be the proud possessor of a new voice synthesizer, listen-He stands a Zenith portable on a table he makes from a modest suitcase,attracting a small audience in the process, plugs in the voicebox, types at theC> prompt: GOand it recites in voice exact and fine:Orientis princeps Bëelzebub, inferni irredentista menarche et demigorgon, propitiamus vows . . . I hurry onward, hurry down the streetwhile paper ghosts, old printouts, dog my heels,and hear him patter like a market man:Not twentynot eighteennot fifteenCost me twelve lady so help me Satan but to you?Because I like your pretty facebecause I want to raise your spirits. Five.That's right. Five. Sold to the lady with the lovely eyes . . .V.The archbishop hunches glaucous blind in the darkness on the edge of St. Paul's,small, birdlike, luminous, Humming I/O, I/O, I/O.It's almost six and the rush-hour traffic in stolen dreamsand expanded memory hustles the pavement below us. I hand the man my jug.He takes it, carefully, and shuffles back into the waiting cathedral shadows.When he returns the jug is full once more.I josh, ""Guaranteed holy?""He traces one word in the frozen dirt: WYSIWYGand does not smile back. (Wheezy wig. Whisky whig.)He coughs gray, milk phlegm,spits onto the steps. What I see in the jug: it looks holy enough, but you can't know for sure,not unless you are yourself a siren or a fetch,coagulating out of a telecom mouthpiece, riding the bleep,an invocation, some really Wrong Number; then you can tellfrom holy.I've dumped telephones in buckets of the stuff before now,watched things begin to formthen bubble and hiss as the water gets to them:lustrated and asperged, the Final Sanction.One afternoonthere was a queue of them, trapped on the tape of my ansaphone:I copied it to floppy and filed it away.You want it?Listen, everything's for sale. The priest needs shaving, and he's got the shakes.His wine-stained vestments do little to keep him warm.I give him money.(Not much. After all,it's just water, some creatures are so stupidThey'll do you a Savini gunk-dissolveif you sprinkle them with Perrierfor chrissakes, whining the whole time,All my evil, my beautiful evil.) The old priest pockets the coin, gives mea bag of crumbs as a bonus,sits on his steps, hugging himself. I feel the need to say something before I leave.Look, I tell him, it's not your fault.It's just a multi-user system.You weren't to know.If prayers could be networked,if saintware were up and running,if you could make your side as reliable as they've made theirs . . .""What You See,"" he mutters desolately,""What You See Is What You Get."" He crumbles a communion waferthrows it down for the pigeons,makes no attempt to catch even the slowest bird. Cold wars produce bad losers.I go home.VI.News at Ten. And here is Abel Drugger, reading it:VII.The corners of my eyes catch hasty, bloodless motion-a mouse?Well, certainly a peripheral of some kind.VIII.It's bedtime. I feed the pigeons,then undress.Contemplate downloading a succubus from a board,maybe just call up a sidekick(there's public-domain stuff, bawds and bauds,shareware, no need to pay a fortune,even copy-protected stuff can be copied, passed about,everything has a price, any of us).Dryware, wetware, hardware, software,blackware, darkware,nightware, nightmare . . .The modem sits inviting beside the phone,red eyes.I let it rest-you can't trust anybody these days.You download, hell, you don't know where what came from anymore,who had it last.Well, aren't you? Aren't you scared of viruses?Even the better protected files corrupt,and the best protected corrupt absolutely. In the kitchen I hear the pigeons billing and queuing,dreaming of left-handed knives,of athanors and mirrors. Pigeon blood stains the floor of my study. Alone, I sleep. And all alone I dreamIX.Perhaps I wake in the night, suddenly comprehending something,reach out,scribble on the back of an old billmy revelation, my newfound understanding,knowing that morning will render it prosaic,knowing that magic is a night-time thing,then remembering when it still was . . .Revelation retreats to cliché, listen:Things seemed simpler before we kept computers.X.Waking or dreaming from outside I hearwild sabbats, screaming winds, tape hum, metal machine music;witches astride ghetto blasters crowd the moon,then land on the heath their naked flanks aglisten.No one pays anything to attend the meet, each has it taken care of in advance,baby bones with fat still clinging to them;these things are direct debit, standing order,and I seeor think I seea face I recognize and all of them queue up to kiss his ass,let's rim the Devil, boys, cold seed,and in the dark he turns and looks at me:One door opens, another one slams,I trust that everything is satisfactory?We do what we can, everybody's got the right to turn an honest penny;we're all bankrupt, sir,we're all redundant,but we make the best of it, whistle through the Blitz,that's the business. Fair trade is no robbery.Tuesday morning, then, sir, with the pigeons? I nod and draw the curtains. Junk mail is everywhere.They'll get to you,one way or another they'll get to you; somedayI'll find my tube train underground, I'll pay no fare,just ""This is Hell, and I want out of it,""and then things will be simple once again. It will come for me like a dragon down a dark tunnel.

THE SWEEPER OF DREAMS
After all the dreaming is over, after you wake, and leave the world of madness and glory for the mundane day-lit daily grind, through the wreckage of your abandoned fancies walks the sweeper of dreams.Who knows what he was when he was alive? Or if, for that matter, he ever was alive. He certainly will not answer your questions. The sweeper talks little, in his gruff gray voice, and when he does speak it is mostly about the weather and the prospects, victories and defeats of certain sports teams. He despises everyone who is not him.Just as you wake he comes to you, and he sweeps up kingdoms and castles, and angels and owls, mountains and oceans. He sweeps up the lust and the love and the lovers, the sages who are not butterflies, the flowers of meat, the running of the deer and the sinking of the Lusitania. He sweeps up everything you left behind in your dreams, the life you wore, the eyes through which you gazed, the examination paper you were never able to find. One by one he sweeps them away: the sharp-toothed woman who sank her teeth into your face; the nuns in the woods; the dead arm that broke through the tepid water of the bath; the scarlet worms that crawled in your chest when you opened your shirt.He will sweep it up-everything you left behind when you woke. And then he will burn it, to leave the stage fresh for your dreams tomorrow.Treat him well, if you see him. Be polite with him. Ask him no questions. Applaud his teams' victories, commiserate with him over their losses, agree with him about the weather. Give him the respect he feels is his due.For there are people he no longer visits, the sweeper of dreams, with his hand-rolled cigarettes and his dragon tattoo.You've seen them. They have mouths that twitch, and eyes that stare, and they babble and they mewl and they whimper. Some of them walk the cities in ragged clothes, their belongings under their arms. Others of their number are locked in the dark, in places where they can no longer harm themselves or others. They are not mad, or rather, the loss of their sanity is the lesser of their problems. It is worse than madness. They will tell you, if you let them: they are the ones who live, each day, in the wreckage of their dreams.And if the sweeper of dreams leaves you, he will never come back.

FOREIGN PARTS
The VENEREAL DISEASE is disease contracted as a consequence of impure connexion. The fearful constitutional consequences which may result from this affection,-consequences, the fear of which may haunt the mind for years, which may taint the whole springs of health, and be transmitted to circulate in the young blood of innocent offspring,-are indeed terrible considerations, too terrible not to render the disease one of those which must unhesitatingly be placed under medical care.- SPENCER THOMAS, M.D., L.R.C.S. (EDIN.),A DICTIONARY OF DOMESTIC MEDICINE AND HOUSEHOLD SURGERY, 1882Simon Powers didn't like sex. Not really.He disliked having someone else in the same bed as himself; he suspected that he came too soon; he always felt uncomfortably that his performance was in some way being graded, like a driving test or a practical examination.He had got laid in college a few times and once, three years ago, after the office New Year's party. But that had been that, and as far as Simon was concerned, he was well out of it.It occurred to him once, during a slack time at the office, that he would have liked to have lived in the days of Queen Victoria, where well-brought-up women were no more than resentful sex dolls in the bedroom: they'd unlace their stays, loosen their petticoats (revealing pinkish-white flesh) then lie back and suffer the indignities of the carnal act-an indignity it would never even occur to them that they were meant to enjoy.He filed it away for later, another masturbatory fantasy.Simon masturbated a great deal. Every night-sometimes more than that if he was unable to sleep. He could take as long, or as short, a time to climax as he wished. And in his mind he had had them all. Film and television stars; women from the office; schoolgirls; the naked models who pouted from the crumpled pages of Fiesta; faceless slaves in chains; tanned boys with bodies like Greek gods . . .Night after night they paraded in front of him.It was safer that way.In his mind.And afterward he'd fall asleep, comfortable and safe in a world he controlled, and he'd sleep without dreaming. Or at least, he never remembered his dreams in the morning.The morning it started he was woken by the radio (""Two hundred killed and many others believed to be injured; and now over to Jack for the weather and traffic news . . . ""), dragged himself out of bed, and stumbled, bladder aching, into the bathroom.He pulled up the toilet seat and urinated. It felt like he was pissing needles.He needed to urinate again after breakfast-less painfully, since the flow was not as heavy-and three more times before lunch.Each time it hurt.He told himself that it couldn't be a venereal disease. That was something that other people got, and something (he thought of his last sexual encounter, three years in the past) that you got from other people. You couldn't really catch it from toilet seats, could you? Wasn't that just a joke?Simon Powers was twenty-six, and he worked in a large London bank, in the securities division. He had few friends at work. His only real friend, Nick Lawrence, a lonely Canadian, had recently transferred to another branch, and Simon sat by himself in the staff canteen, staring out at the Docklands Lego landscape, picking at a limp green salad.Someone tapped him on the shoulder.""Simon, I heard a good one today. Wanna hear?"" Jim Jones was the office clown, a dark-haired, intense young man who claimed he had a special pocket on his boxer shorts, for condoms.""Um. Sure.""""Here you go. What's the collective noun for people who work in banks?""""The what?""""Collective noun. You know, like a flock of sheep, a pride of lions. Give up?"" Simon nodded. ""A wunch of bankers.""Simon must have looked puzzled, because Jim sighed and said,""Wunch of bankers. Bunch of wankers. God, you're slow . . ."" Then, spotting a group of young women at a far table, Jim straightened his tie and carried his tray over to them.He could hear Jim telling his joke to the women, this time with added hand movements.They all got it immediately.Simon left his salad on the table and went back to work.That night he sat in his chair in his bedsitter flat with the television turned off, and he tried to remember what he knew about venereal diseases.There was syphilis, which pocked your face and drove the Kings of England mad; gonorrhea-the clap-a green oozing and more madness; crabs, little pubic lice, which nested and itched (he inspected his pubic hairs through a magnifying glass, but nothing moved); AIDS, the eighties plague, a plea for clean needles and safer sexual habits (but what could be safer than a clean wank for one into a fresh handful of white tissues?); herpes, which had something to do with cold sores (he checked his lips in the mirror, they looked fine). That was all he knew.And he went to bed and fretted himself to sleep, without daring to masturbate.That night he dreamed of tiny women with blank faces, walking in endless rows between gargantuan office blocks, like an army of soldier ants.Simon did nothing about the pain for another two days. He hoped it would go away, or get better on its own. It didn't. It got worse. The pain continued for up to an hour after urination; his penis felt raw and bruised inside.And on the third day, he phoned his doctor's surgery to make an appointment. He had dreaded having to tell the woman who answered the phone what the problem was, and so he was relieved, and perhaps just a little disappointed, when she didn't ask but simply made an appointment for the following day.He told his senior at the bank that he had a sore throat and would need to see the doctor about it. He could feel his cheeks burn as he told her, but she did not remark on this, merely told him that that would be fine.When he left her office, he found that he was shaking.It was a gray wet day when he arrived at the doctor's surgery.There was no queue, and he went straight in to the doctor. Not his regular doctor, Simon was comforted to see. This was a young Pakistani, of about Simon's age, who interrupted Simon's stammered recitation of symptoms to ask:""Urinating more than usual, are we?""Simon nodded.""Any discharge?""Simon shook his head.""Right ho. I'd like you to take down your trousers, if you don't mind.""Simon took them down. The doctor peered at his penis. ""You do have a discharge, you know,"" he said.Simon did himself up again.""Now, Mr. Powers, tell me, do you think it possible that you might have picked up from someone, a, uh, venereal disease?""Simon shook his head vigorously. ""I haven't had sex with anyone-"" he had almost said 'anyone else' ""-in almost three years.""""No?"" The doctor obviously didn't believe him. He smelled of exotic spices and had the whitest teeth Simon had ever seen. ""Well, you have either contracted gonorrhea or NSU. Probably NSU: nonspecific urethritis. Which is less famous and less painful than gonorrhea, but it can be a bit of an old bastard to treat. You can get rid of gonorrhea with one big dose of antibiotics. Kills the bugger off . . ."" He clapped his hands twice. Loudly. ""Just like that.""""You don't know, then?""""Which one it is? Good Lord, no. I'm not even going to try to find out. I'm sending you to a special clinic, which takes care of all of that kind of thing. I'll give you a note to take with you."" He pulled a pad of headed notepaper from a drawer. ""What is your profession, Mr. Powers?""""I work in a bank.""""A teller?""""No."" He shook his head. ""I'm in securities. I clerk for two assistant managers."" A thought occurred to him. ""They don't have to know about this, do they?""The doctor looked shocked. ""Good gracious, no.""He wrote a note, in a careful, round handwriting, stating that Simon Powers, age twenty-six, had something that was probably NSU. He had a discharge. Said he had had no sex for three years. In discomfort. Please could they let him know the results of the tests. He signed it with a squiggle. Then he handed Simon a card with the address and phone number of the special clinic on it. ""Here you are. This is where you go. Not to worry-happens to lots of people. See all the cards I have here? Not to worry-you'll soon be right as rain. Phone them when you get home and make an appointment.""Simon took the card and stood up to go.""Don't worry,"" said the doctor. ""It won't prove difficult to treat.""Simon nodded and tried to smile.He opened the door to go out.""And, at any rate, it's nothing really nasty, like syphilis,"" said the doctor.The two elderly women sitting outside in the hallway waiting area looked up delightedly at this fortuitous overheard, and stared hungrily at Simon as he walked away.He wished he were dead.On the pavement outside, waiting for the bus home, Simon thought: I've got a venereal disease. I've got a venereal disease. I've got a venereal disease. Over and over, like a mantra.He should toll a bell as he walked.On the bus he tried not to get too close to his fellow passengers. He was certain they knew (couldn't they read the plague marks on his face?); and at the same time he was ashamed he was forced to keep it a secret from them.He got back to the flat and went straight into the bathroom, expecting to see a decayed horror-movie face, a rotting skull fuzzy with blue mold, staring back at him from the mirror. Instead, he saw a pink-cheeked bank clerk in his mid-twenties, fair-haired, perfect-skinned.He fumbled out his penis and scrutinized it with care. It was neither a gangrenous green nor a leprous white, but looked perfectly normal, except for the slightly swollen tip and the clear discharge that lubricated the hole. He realized that his white underpants had been stained across the crotch by the leak.Simon felt angry with himself and angrier with God for having given him a (say it) (dose of the clap) obviously meant for someone else.He masturbated that night for the first time in four days.He fantasized a schoolgirl in blue cotton panties who changed into a policewoman, then two policewomen, then three.It didn't hurt at all until he climaxed; then he felt as if someone were pushing a switchblade through the inside of his cock. As if he were ejaculating a pincushion.He began to cry then in the darkness, but whether from the pain, or from some other reason, less easy to identify, even Simon was unsure.That was the last time he masturbated.The clinic was located in a dour Victorian hospital in central London. A young man in a white coat looked at Simon's card, and took his doctor's note, and told him to take a seat.Simon sat down on an orange plastic chair covered with brown cigarette burns.He stared at the floor for a few minutes. Then, having exhausted that form of entertainment, he stared at the walls, and finally, having no other option, at the other people.They were all male, thank God-women were on the next floor up-and there were more than a dozen of them.The most comfortable were the macho building-site types, here for their seventeenth or seventieth time, looking rather pleased with themselves, as if whatever they had caught were proof of their virility. There were a few city gents in ties and suits. One of them looked relaxed; he carried a mobile telephone. Another, hiding behind a Daily Telegraph, was blushing, embarrassed to be there; there were little men with wispy mustaches and tatty raincoats-newspaper sellers, perhaps, or retired teachers; a rotund Malaysian gentleman who chain-smoked filterless cigarettes, lighting each cigarette from the butt of the one before, so the flame never went out, but was transmitted from one dying cigarette to the next. In one corner sat a scared gay couple. Neither of them looked more than eighteen. This was obviously their first appointment as well, the way they kept glancing around. They were holding hands, white-knuckled and discreetly. They were terrified.Simon felt comforted. He felt less alone.""Mister Powers, please,"" said the man at the desk. Simon stood up, conscious that all eyes were upon him, that he'd been identified and named in front of all these people. A cheerful, red-haired doctor in a white coat was waiting.""Follow me,"" he said.They walked down some corridors, through a door (on which DR. J. BENHAM was written in felt pen on a white sheet of paper scotch-taped to the frosted glass), into a doctor's office.""I'm Doctor Benham,"" said the doctor. He didn't offer to shake hands. ""You have a note from your doctor?""""I gave it to the man at the desk.""""Oh."" Dr. Benham opened a file on the desk in front of him. There was a computer printout label on the side. It said: REG'D 2 JLY 90. MALE. 90/00666.LPOWERS, SIMON, MR.BORN 12 OCT 63. SINGLE. Benham read the note, looked at Simon's penis, and handed him a sheet of blue paper from the file. It had the same label, stuck to the top.""Take a seat in the corridor,"" he told him. ""A nurse will collect you.""Simon waited in the corridor.""They're very fragile,"" said the sunburnt man sitting next to him, by accent a South African or perhaps Zimbabwean. Colonial accent, at any rate.""I'm sorry?""""Very fragile. Venereal diseases. Think about it. You can catch a cold or flu simply by being in the same room as someone who's got it. Venereal diseases need warmth and moisture, and intimate contact.""Not mine, thought Simon, but he didn't say anything.""You know what I'm dreading?"" said the South African.Simon shook his head.""Telling my wife,"" said the man, and he fell silent.A nurse came and took Simon away. She was young and pretty, and he followed her into a cubicle. She took the blue slip of paper from him.""Take off your jacket and roll up your right sleeve.""""My jacket?""She sighed. ""For the blood test.""""Oh.""The blood test was almost pleasant, compared to what came next.""Take down your trousers,"" she told him. She had a marked Australian accent. His penis had shrunk, tightly pulled in on itself; it looked gray and wrinkled. He found himself wanting to tell her that it was normally much larger, but then she picked up a metal instrument with a wire loop at the end, and he wished it were even smaller. ""Squeeze your penis at the base and push forward a few times."" He did so. She stuck the loop into the head of his penis and twisted it around the inside. He winced at the pain. She smeared the discharge onto a glass slide. Then she pointed to a glass jar on a shelf. ""Can you urinate into that for me, please?""""What, from here?""She pursed her lips. Simon suspected that she must have heard that joke thirty times a day since she had been working there.She went out of the cubicle and left him alone to pee.Simon found it difficult to pee at the best of times, often having to wait around in toilets until all the people had gone. He envied men who could casually walk into toilets, unzip, and carry on cheerful conversations with their neighbors in the adjoining urinal, all the while showering the white porcelain with yellow urine. Often he couldn't do it at all.He couldn't do it now.The nurse came in again. ""No luck? Not to worry. Take a seat back in the waiting room, and the doctor will call you in a minute.""""Well,"" said Dr. Benham. ""You have NSU. Nonspecific urethritis.""Simon nodded, and then he said, ""What does that mean?""""It means you don't have gonorrhea, Mister Powers.""""But I haven't had sex with, with anyone, for . . . """"Oh, that's nothing to worry about. It can be a quite spontaneous disease-you need not, um, indulge, to pick it up."" Benham reached into a desk drawer and pulled out a bottle of pills. ""Take one of these four times a day before meals. Stay off alcohol, no sex, and don't drink milk for a couple of hours after taking one. Got it?""Simon grinned nervously.""I'll see you next week. Make an appointment downstairs.""Downstairs they gave him a red card with his name on and the time of his appointment. It also had a number on: 90/00666.L.Walking home in the rain, Simon paused outside a travel agents'. The poster in the window showed a beach in the sun and three bronzed women in bikinis, sipping long drinks.Simon had never been abroad.Foreign places made him nervous.As the week went on, the pain went away; and four days later Simon found himself able to urinate without flinching.Something else was happening, however.It began as a tiny seed, which took root in his mind, and grew. He told Dr. Benham about it at his next appointment.Benham was puzzled.""You're saying that you don't feel your penis is your own anymore, then, Mister Powers?""""That's right, Doctor.'""I'm afraid I don't quite follow you. Is there some kind of loss of sensation?""Simon could feel his penis inside his trousers, felt the sensation of cloth against flesh. In the darkness it began to stir.""Not at all. I can feel everything like I always could. It's just it feels . . . well, different, I suppose. Like it isn't really part of me anymore. Like it . . ."" He paused. ""Like it belongs to someone else.""Dr. Benham shook his head. ""To answer your question, Mr. Powers, that isn't a symptom of NSU-although it's a perfectly valid psychological reaction for someone who has contracted it. A, uh, feeling of disgust with yourself, perhaps, which you've externalized as a rejection of your genitalia.""That sounds about right, thought Dr. Benham. He hoped he had got the jargon correct. He had never paid much attention to his psychology lectures or textbooks, which might explain, or so his wife maintained, why he was currently serving out a stint in a London VD clinic.Powers looked a little soothed.""I was just a bit worried, Doctor, that's all."" He chewed his lower lip. ""Um, what exactly is NSU?""Benham smiled, reassuringly. ""Could be any one of a number of things. NSU is just our way of saying we don't know exactly what it is. It's not gonorrhea. It's not chlamydia. 'Nonspecific,' you see. It's an infection, and it responds to antibiotics. Which reminds me . . ."" He opened a desk drawer and took out a new week's supply.""Make an appointment downstairs for next week. No sex. No alcohol.""No sex? thought Simon. Not bloody likely.But when he walked past the pretty Australian nurse in the corridor, he felt his penis begin to stir again, begin to get warm and to harden.Benham saw Simon the following week. Tests showed he still had the disease.Benham shrugged.""It's not unusual for it to hang on for this long. You say you feel no discomfort?""""No. None at all. And I haven't seen any discharge, either.""Benham was tired, and a dull pain throbbed behind his left eye. He glanced down at the tests in the folder. ""You've still got it, I'm afraid.""Simon Powers shifted his seat. He had large watery blue eyes and a pale unhappy face. ""What about the other thing, Doctor?""The doctor shook his head. ""What other thing?""""I told you,"" said Simon. ""Last week. I told you. The feeling that my, um, my penis wasn't, isn't my penis anymore.""Of course, thought Benham. It's that patient. There was never any way he could remember the procession of names and faces and penises, with their awkwardness, and their braggadocio, and their sweaty nervous smells, and their sad little diseases.""Mm. What about it?""""It's spreading, Doctor. The whole lower half of my body feels like it's someone else's. My legs and everything. I can feel them, all right, and they go where I want them to go, but sometimes I get the feeling that if they wanted to go somewhere else-if they wanted to go walking off into the world-they could, and they'd take me with them.""I wouldn't be able to do anything to stop it.""Benham shook his head. He hadn't really been listening. ""We'll change your antibiotics. If the others haven't knocked this disease out by now, I'm sure these will. They'll probably get rid of this other feeling as well-it's probably just a side effect of the antibiotics.""The young man just stared at him.Benham felt he should say something else. ""Perhaps you should try to get out more,"" he said.The young man stood up.""Same time next week. No sex, no booze, no milk after the pills."" The doctor recited his litany.The young man walked away. Benham watched him carefully, but could see nothing strange about the way he walked.On Saturday night Dr. Jeremy Benham and his wife, Celia, attended a dinner party held by a professional colleague. Benham sat next to a foreign psychiatrist.They began to talk, over the hors d'oeuvres.""The trouble with telling folks you're a psychiatrist,"" said the psychiatrist, who was American, and huge, and bullet-headed, and looked like a merchant marine, ""is you get to watch them trying to act normal for the rest of the evening."" He chuckled, low and dirty.Benham chuckled, too, and since he was sitting next to a psychiatrist, he spent the rest of the evening trying to act normally.He drank too much wine with his dinner.After the coffee, when he couldn't think of anything else to say, he told the psychiatrist (whose name was Marshall, although he told Benham to call him Mike) what he could recall of Simon Powers's delusions.Mike laughed. ""Sounds fun. Maybe a tiny bit spooky. But nothing to worry about. Probably just a hallucination caused by a reaction to the antibiotics. Sounds a little like Capgras's Syndrome. You heard about that over here?""Benham nodded, then thought, then said, ""No."" He poured himself another glass of wine, ignoring his wife's pursed lips and almost imperceptibly shaken head.""Well, Capgras's Syndrome,"" said Mike, ""is this funky delusion. Whole piece on it in The Journal of American Psychiatry about five years back. Basically, it's where a person believes that the important people in his or her life-family members, workmates, parents, loved ones, whatever-have been replaced by-get this!-exact doubles.""Doesn't apply to everyone they know. Just selected people. Often just one person in their life. No accompanying delusions, either. Just that one thing. Acutely emotionally disturbed people with paranoid tendencies.""The psychiatrist picked his nose with his thumbnail. ""I ran into a case myself, couple, two, three years back.""""Did you cure him?""The psychiatrist gave Benham a sideways look and grinned, showing all his teeth. ""In psychiatry, Doctor-unlike, perhaps, the world of sexually transmitted disease clinics-there is no such thing as a cure. There is only adjustment.""Benham sipped the red wine. Later it occurred to him that he would never have said what he said next if it wasn't for the wine. Not aloud, anyway.""I don't suppose . . ."" He paused, remembering a film he had seen as a teenager. (Something about bodysnatchers?) ""I don't suppose that anyone ever checked to see if those people had been removed and replaced by exact doubles . . . ?""Mike-Marshall-whatever-gave Benham a very funny look indeed and turned around in his chair to talk to his neighbor on the other side.Benham, for his part, carried on trying to act normally (whatever that was) and failed miserably. He got very drunk indeed, started muttering about ""fucking colonials,"" and had a blazing row with his wife after the party was over, none of which were particularly normal occurrences.Benham's wife locked him out of their bedroom after the argument.He lay on the sofa downstairs, covered by a crumpled blanket, and masturbated into his underpants, his hot seed spurting across his stomach.In the small hours he was woken by a cold sensation around his loins.He wiped himself off with his dress shirt and returned to sleep.Simon was unable to masturbate.He wanted to, but his hand wouldn't move. It lay beside him, healthy, fine; but it was as if he had forgotten how to make it respond. Which was silly, wasn't it?Wasn't it?He began to sweat. It dripped from his face and forehead onto the white cotton sheets, but the rest of his body was dry.Cell by cell, something was reaching up inside him. It brushed his face tenderly, like the kiss of a lover; it was licking his throat, breathing on his cheek. Touching him.He had to get out of the bed. He couldn't get out of the bed.He tried to scream, but his mouth wouldn't open. His larynx refused to vibrate.Simon could still see the ceiling, lit by the lights of passing cars. The ceiling blurred: His eyes were still his own, and tears were oozing out of them, down his face, soaking the pillow.They don't know what I've got, he thought. They said I had what everyone else gets. But I didn't catch that. I've caught something different.Or maybe, he thought, as his vision clouded over and the darkness swallowed the last of Simon Powers, it caught me.Soon after that, Simon got up, and washed, and inspected himself carefully in front of the bathroom mirror. Then he smiled, as if he liked what he saw.Benham smiled. ""I'm pleased to tell you,"" he said, ""that I can give you a clean bill of health.""Simon Powers stretched in his seat, lazily, and nodded. ""I feel terrific,"" he said.He did look well, Benham thought. Glowing with health. He seemed taller as well. A very attractive young man, decided the doctor. ""So, uh, no more of those feelings?""""Feelings?""""Those feelings you were telling me about. That your body didn't belong to you anymore.""Simon waved a hand, gently, fanning his face. The cold weather had broken, and London was stewing in a sudden heat-wave; it didn't feel like England anymore.Simon seemed amused.""All of this body belongs to me, Doctor. I'm certain of that.""Simon Powers (90/00666.L SINGLE. MALE.) grinned like the world belonged to him as well.The doctor watched him as he walked out of the surgery. He looked stronger now, less fragile.The next patient on Jeremy Benham's appointment card was a twenty-two-year-old boy. Benham was going to have to tell him he was HIV positive. I hate this job, he thought. I need a holiday.He walked down the corridor to call the boy in and pushed past Simon Powers, talking animatedly to a pretty young Australian nurse. ""It must be a lovely place,"" he was telling her. ""I want to see it. I want to go everywhere. I want to meet everyone."" He was resting a hand on her arm, and she was making no move to free herself from it.Dr. Benham stopped beside them. He touched Simon on the shoulder. ""Young man,"" he said. ""Don't let me see you back here.""Simon Powers grinned. ""You won't see me here again, Doctor,"" he said. ""Not as such, anyway. I've packed in my job. I'm going around the world."" They shook hands. Powers's hand was warm and comfortable and dry.Benham walked away, but could not avoid hearing Simon Powers, still talking to the nurse.""It's going to be so great,"" he was saying to her. Benham wondered if he was talking about sex or world travel, or possibly, in some way, both.""I'm going to have such fun,"" said Simon. ""I'm loving it already.""

VAMPIRE SESTINA
I wait here at the boundaries of dream,all shadow-wrapped. The dark air tastes of night,so cold and crisp, and I wait for my love.The moon has bleached the color from her stone.She'll come, and then we'll stalk this pretty worldalive to darkness and the tang of blood. It is a lonely game, the quest for blood,but still, a body's got the right to dreamand I'd not give it up for all the world.The moon has leeched the darkness from the night.I stand in shadows, staring at her stone:Undead, my lover. . . O, undead my love? I dreamt you while I slept today and lovemeant more to me than life-meant more than blood.The sunlight sought me, deep beneath my stone,more dead than any corpse but still a-dreamuntil I woke as vapor into nightand sunset forced me out into the world. For many centuries I've walked the worlddispensing something that resembled love-a stolen kiss, then back into the nightcontented by the life and by the blood.And come the morning I was just a dream,cold body chilling underneath a stone. I said I would not hurt you. Am I stoneto leave you prey to time and to the world?I offered you a truth beyond your dreamswhile all you had to offer was your love.I told you not to worry and that bloodtastes sweeter on the wing and late at night. Sometimes my lovers rise to walk the night . . .Sometimes they lie, cold corpse beneath a stone,and never know the joys of bed and blood,of walking through the shadows of the world;instead they rot to maggots. O my lovethey whispered you had risen, in my dream. I've waited by your stone for half the nightbut you won't leave your dream to hunt for blood.Good night, my love. I offered you the world.

MOUSE
They had a number of devices that would kill the mouse fast, others that would kill it more slowly. There were a dozen variants on the traditional mousetrap, the one Regan tended to think of as a Tom and Jerry trap: a metal spring trap that would slam down at a touch, breaking the mouse's back; there were other gadgets on the shelves-ones that suffocated the mouse, others that electrocuted it, or even drowned it, each safe in its multicolored cardboard package.""These weren't quite what I was looking for,"" said Regan.""Well, that's all we got in the way of traps,"" said the woman, who wore a large plastic name tag that said her name was BECKY and that she LOVES WORKING FOR YOU AT MACREA'S ANIMAL FEED AND SPECIALTY STORE. ""Now, over here-""She pointed to a stand-alone display of HUN-GREE-CAT MOUSE POISON sachets. A little rubber mouse lay on the top of the display, his legs in the air.Regan experienced a sudden memory flash, unbidden: Gwen, extending an elegant pink hand, her fingers curled upward. ""What's that?"" she said. It was the week before he had left for America.""I don't know,"" said Regan. They were in the bar of a small hotel in the West Country, burgundy-colored carpets, fawn-colored wallpaper. He was nursing a gin and tonic; she was sipping her second glass of Chablis. Gwen had once told Regan that blondes should only drink white wine; it looked better. He laughed until he realized she meant it.""It's a dead one of these,"" she said, turning her hand over so the fingers hung like the legs of a slow pink animal. He smiled. Later he paid the bill, and they went upstairs to Regan's room . . .""No. Not poison. You see, I don't want to kill it,"" he told the saleswoman, Becky.She looked at him curiously, as if he had just begun to speak in a foreign tongue. ""But you said you wanted mousetraps . . . ?""""Look, what I want is a humane trap. It's like a corridor. The mouse goes in, the door shuts behind it, it can't get out.""""So how do you kill it?""""You don't kill it. You drive a few miles away and let it go. And it doesn't come back to bother you.""Becky was smiling now, examining him as if he were just the most darling thing, just the sweetest, dumbest, cutest little thing. ""You stay here,"" she said. ""I'll check out back.""She walked through a door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY. She had a nice bottom, thought Regan, and was sort of attractive, in a dull Midwestern sort of way.He glanced out the window. Janice was sitting in the car, reading her magazine: a red-haired woman in a dowdy housecoat. He waved at her, but she wasn't looking at him.Becky put her head back through the doorway. ""Jackpot!"" she said. ""How many you want?""""Two?""""No problem."" She was gone again and returned with two small green plastic containers. She rang them up on the cash register, and as he fumbled through his notes and coins, still unfamiliar, trying to put together the correct change, she examined the traps, smiling, turning the packets over in her hands.""My lord,"" she said. ""Whatever will they think of next?""The heat slammed Regan as he stepped out of the store.He hurried over to the car. The metal door handle was hot in his hand; the engine was idling.He climbed in. ""I got two,"" he said. The air-conditioning in the car was cool and pleasant.""Seatbelt on,"" said Janice. ""You've really got to learn to drive over here."" She put down her magazine.""I will,"" he said. ""Eventually.""Regan was scared of driving in America: it was like driving on the other side of a mirror.They said nothing else, and Regan read the instructions on the back of the mousetrap boxes. According to the text, the main attraction of this type of trap was that you never needed to see, touch, or handle the mouse. The door would close behind it, and that would be that. The instructions said nothing about not killing the mouse.When they got home, he took the traps out of the boxes, put a little peanut butter in one, down at the far end, a lump of cooking chocolate in the other, and placed them on the floor of the pantry, one against the wall, the other near the hole that the mice seemed to be using to gain access to the pantry.The traps were only corridors. A door at one end, a wall at the other.In bed that night Regan reached out and touched Janice's breasts as she slept; touched them gently, not wanting to wake her. They were perceptibly fuller. He wished he found large breasts erotic. He found himself wondering what it must be like to suck a woman's breasts while she was lactating. He could imagine sweetness, but no specific taste.Janice was sound asleep, but still she moved toward him.He edged away; lay there in the dark, trying to remember how to sleep, hunting through alternatives in his mind. It was so hot, so stuffy. When they'd lived in Ealing he'd fallen asleep instantly, he was certain.There was a sharp scream from the garden. Janice stirred and rolled away from him. It had sounded almost human. Foxes can sound like small children in pain-Regan had heard this long ago. Or perhaps it was a cat. Or a night bird of some kind.Something had died, anyway, in the night. Of that there was no doubt at all.The next morning one of the traps had been sprung, although when Regan opened it carefully, it proved to be empty. The chocolate bait had been nibbled. He opened the door to the trap once more and replaced it by the wall.Janice was crying to herself in the lounge. Regan stood beside her; she reached out her hand, and he held it tightly. Her fingers were cold. She was still wearing her nightgown, and she had put on no makeup.Later she made a phone call.A package arrived for Regan shortly before noon by Federal Express, containing a dozen floppy disks, each filled with numbers for him to inspect and sort and classify.He worked at the computer until six, sitting in front of a small metal fan that whirred and rattled and moved the hot air around.He turned on the radio that evening while he cooked."". . . what my book tells everyone. What the liberals don't want us to know."" The voice was high, nervous, arrogant.""Yeah. Some of it was, well kinda hard to believe."" The host was encouraging: a deep radio voice, reassuring and easy on the ears.""Of course it's hard to believe. It runs against everything they want you to believe. The liberals and the how-mo-sexuals in the media, they don't let you know the truth.""""Well, we all know that, friend. We'll be right back after this song.""It was a country and western song. Regan kept the radio tuned to the local National Public Radio station; sometimes they broadcast the BBC World Service News. Someone must have retuned it, he supposed, although he couldn't imagine who.He took a sharp knife and cut through the chicken breast with care, parting the pink flesh, slicing it into strips all ready to stir-fry, listening to the song.Somebody's heart was broken; somebody no longer cared. The song ended. There was a commercial for beer. Then the men began to talk again.""Thing is, nobody believes it at first. But I got the documents. I got the photographs. You read my book. You'll see. It's the unholy alliance, and I do mean unholy, between the so-called pro-choice lobby, the medical community, and how-mo-sexuals. The how-mos need these murders because that's where they get the little children they use to experiment with to find a cure for AIDS.""I mean, those liberals talk about Nazi atrocities, but nothing those Nazis did comes in even close to what they're doing, even as we speak. They take these human fetuses and they graft them onto little mice to create these human-mouse hybrid creatures for their experiments. Then they inject them with AIDS . . .""Regan found himself thinking of Mengele's wall of strung eyeballs. Blue eyes and brown eyes and hazel . . .""Shit!"" He'd sliced into his thumb. He pushed it into his mouth, bit down on it to stop the bleeding, ran into the bathroom, and began to hunt for a Band-Aid.""Remember, I'll need to be out of the house by ten tomorrow."" Janice was standing behind him. He looked at her blue eyes in the bathroom mirror. She looked calm.""Fine."" He pulled the Band-Aid onto his thumb, hiding and binding the wound, and turned to face her.""I saw a cat in the garden today,"" she said. ""A big gray one. Maybe it's a stray.""""Maybe.""""Did you think any more about getting a pet?""""Not really. It'd just be something else to worry about. I thought we agreed: no pets.""She shrugged.They went back into the kitchen. He poured oil into the frying pan and lit the gas. He dropped the strips of pink flesh into the pan and watched them shrink and discolor and change.Janice drove herself to the bus station early the next morning. It was a long drive into the city, and she'd be in no condition to drive when she was ready to return. She took five hundred dollars with her, in cash.Regan checked the traps. Neither of them had been touched. Then he prowled the corridors of the house.Eventually, he phoned Gwen. The first time he misdialed, his fingers slipping on the buttons of the phone, the long string of digits confusing him. He tried again.A ringing, then her voice on the line. ""Allied Accountancy Associates. Good afternoon.""""Gwennie? It's me.""""Regan? It's you, isn't it? I was hoping you'd call eventually. I missed you."" Her voice was distant; transatlantic crackle and hum taking her farther away from him.""It's expensive.""""Any more thoughts about coming back?""""I don't know.""""So how's wifeykins?""""Janice is . . . "" He paused. Sighed. ""Janice is just fine.""""I've started fucking our new sales director,"" said Gwen. ""After your time. You don't know him. You've been gone for six months now. I mean, what's a girl to do?""It occurred then to Regan that that was what he hated most about women: their practicality. Gwen had always made him use a condom, although he disliked condoms, while she had also used a diaphragm and a spermicide. Regan felt that somewhere in all there a level of spontaneity, of romance, of passion, was lost. He liked sex to be something that just happened, half in his head, half out of it. Something sudden and dirty and powerful.His forehead began to throb.""So what's the weather like out there?"" Gwen asked brightly.""It's hot,"" said Regan.""Wish it was here. It's been raining for weeks.""He said something about it being lovely to hear her voice again. Then he put down the phone.Regan checked the traps. Still empty.He wandered into his office and flipped on the TV."". . . this is a little one. That's what fetus means. And one day she'll grow up to be a big one. She's got little fingers, little toes-she's even got little toenails.""A picture on the screen: red and pulsing and indistinct. It cut to a woman with a huge smile, cuddling a baby.""Some little ones like her will grow up to be nurses, or teachers, or musicians. One day one of them may even be President.""Back to the pink thing, filling the screen.""But this little one will never grow up to be a big one. She's going to be killed tomorrow. And her mother says it isn't murder."" He flipped channels until he found ""I Love Lucy,"" the perfect background nothing, then he turned on the computer and got down to work.After two hours spent chasing an error of under a hundred dollars through seemingly endless columns of figures, his head began to ache. He got up and walked into the garden.He missed having a garden; missed proper English lawns with proper English grass. The grass out here was withered, brown and sparse, the trees bearded with Spanish moss like a something from a science fiction movie. He followed a track out into the woods behind the house. Something gray and sleek slipped from behind one tree to another.""Here, kitty kitty,"" called Regan. ""Here, puss puss puss.""He walked over to the tree and looked behind it. The cat-or whatever it had been-was gone.Something stung his cheek. He slapped at it without thought, lowered his hand to find it stained with blood, a mosquito, half-squashed, still twitching in his palm.He went back into the kitchen and poured himself a cup of coffee. He missed tea, but it just didn't taste the same out here.Janice got home about six.""How was it?""She shrugged. ""Fine.""""Yeah?""""Yeah.""""I have to go back next week,"" she said. ""For a checkup.""""To make sure they didn't leave any instruments inside you?""""Whatever,"" she said.""I've made a spaghetti Bolognese,"" said Regan.""I'm not hungry,"" said Janice. ""I'm going to bed.""She went upstairs.Regan worked until the numbers no longer added up. He went upstairs and walked quietly into the darkened bedroom. He slipped off his clothes in the moonlight, dropped them onto the carpet, and slid between the sheets.He could feel Janice next to him. Her body was shaking, and the pillow was wet.""Jan?""She had her back to him.""It was horrible,"" she whispered into her pillow. ""It hurt so much. And they wouldn't give me a proper anesthetic or anything. They said I could have a shot of Valium if I wanted one, but they didn't have an anesthetist there anymore. The lady said he couldn't stand the pressure and anyway it would have cost another two hundred dollars and nobody wanted to pay . . .""It hurt so much."" She was sobbing now, gasping the words as if they were being tugged out of her. ""So much.""Regan got out of bed.""Where are you going?""""I don't have to listen to this,"" said Regan. ""I really don't have to listen to this.""It was too hot in the house. Regan walked downstairs in only his underpants. He walked into the kitchen, bare feet making sticking noises on the vinyl.One of the mousetrap doors was closed.He picked up the trap. It felt a trifle heavier than before. He opened the door carefully, a little way. Two beady eyes stared up at him. Light brown fur. He pushed the door shut again and heard a scrabbling from inside the trap.Now what?He couldn't kill it. He couldn't kill anything.The green mousetrap smelled acrid, and the bottom of it was sticky with mouse piss. Regan carried it gingerly out into the garden.A gentle breeze had sprung up. The moon was almost full. He knelt on the ground, placed the trap carefully on the dry grass.He opened the door of the small green corridor.""Run away,"" he whispered, feeling embarrassed at the sound of his voice in the open air. ""Run away, little mouse.""The mouse didn't move. He could see its nose at the door of the trap.""Come on,' said Regan. Bright moonlight; he could see everything, sharply lit and shadowed, if lacking in color.He nudged the trap with his foot.The mouse made a dash for it then. It ran out from the trap, then stopped, turned, and began to hop into the woods.Then it stopped again. The mouse looked up in Regan's direction. Regan was convinced that it was staring at him. It had tiny pink hands. Regan felt almost paternal then. He smiled, wistfully.A streak of gray in the night, and the mouse hung, struggling uselessly, from the mouth of a large gray cat, its eyes burning green in the night. Then the cat bounded into the undergrowth.He thought briefly of pursuing the cat, of freeing the mouse from its jaws . . .There was a sharp scream from the woods; just a night sound, but for a moment Regan thought it sounded almost human, like a woman in pain.He threw the little plastic mousetrap as far from him as he could. He was hoping for a satisfying crash as it hit something, but it fell soundlessly in the bushes.Then Regan walked back inside, and he closed the door of the house behind him.

THE SEA CHANGE
Now is a good time to write this down,now, with the rattle of the pebbles raked by the waves,and the slanting rain cold, cold, pattering and spatteringthe tin roof until I can barely hear myself think,and over it all the wind's low howl. Believe me,I could crawl down to the black waves now,but that would be foolish, under the dark cloud. ""Now hear us as we cry to TheeFor those in peril on the sea."" The old hymn hovers on my lips, unbidden,perhaps I am singing aloud. I cannot tell.I am not old, but when I wake I am wracked with pain,an old sea wreck. Look at my hands.Broken by the waves and the sea: and twisted,they look like something I'd find on the beach, after a storm.I hold my pen like an old man. My father called a sea like this ""a widow-maker.""My mother said the sea was always a widow-maker,even when it was gray and smooth as sky. And she was right.My father drowned in fine weather.Sometimes I wonder if his bones have ever washed ashore,or if I'd know them if they had,twisted and sea-smoothed as they would be. I was a lad of seventeen, cocky as any a young manwho thinks he can make the sea his mistress,and I had promised my mother I'd not go to sea.She'd prenticed me to a stationer, and my days were spentwith reams and quires; but when she died I took her savingsbought myself a small boat. I took my father's dusty nets and lobster pots,raised a three-man crew, all older than I was,and left the inkpots and the nibs for ever. There were good months and bad.Cold, cold, the sea was bitter and brine, the nets cut my hands,the lines were tricksy, dangerous things; still,I'd not have given it up for the world. Not then.The salt scent of my world made me sure I'd live forever.Scudding over the waves in a fine breeze,the sun behind me, faster than a dozen horses across the white wave tops,that was living indeed. The sea had moods. You learned that fast.The day I write of now, she was shifty, evil-humored,the wind coming now and now from all four corners of the compass,the waves all choppy. I could not get the measure of her.We were all out of sight of land when I saw a hand,saw something, reaching from the gray sea.Remembering my father, I ran to the prow and called aloud. No answer but the lonely wail of gulls.And the air was filled with a whirr of white wings, and thenthe swing of the wooden boom, which struck me at the base of the skull:I remember the slow way the cold sea came toward me,enveloped me, swallowed me, took me for its own. I tasted salt. We are made of seawater and bone:That's what the stationer told me when I was a boy.It had occurred to me since that waters break to herald every birth,and I am certain that those waters must taste salt-remembering, perhaps, my own birth.The world beneath the sea was blur. Cold, cold, cold . . . I do not believe I truly saw her. I can not believe.A dream, or madness, the lack of air,the blow upon the head: That's all she was.But when in dreams I see her, as I do, I never doubt her.Old as the sea she was, and young as a new-formed breaker or a swell.Her goblin eyes had spied me. And I knew she wanted me.They say the sea folk have no souls: Perhapsthe sea is one huge soul they breathe and drink and live.She wanted me. And she would have had me; there could be no doubt.And yet . . . They pulled me from the sea and pumped my chestuntil I vomited rich seawater onto the wave-wet shingle.Cold, cold, cold I was, trembling and shivering and sick.My hands were broken and my legs were twisted,as if I had just come up from deep water,scrimshaw and driftwood are my bones,carved messages hidden beneath my flesh. The boat never came back. The crew was never more seen.I live on the charity of the village:There, but for the mercy of the sea, they say, go we.Some years have passed: almost a score.And whole women view me with pity, or with scorn. Outside my cottage the wind's howl has become a screaming,rattling the rain against the tin walls,crunching the flinty shingle, stone against stone. ""Now hear us as we cry to TheeFor those in peril on the sea."" Believe me, I could go down to the sea tonight,drag myself down there on my hands and knees.Give myself to the water and the dark.And to the girl.Let her suck the meat from off these tangled bones,transmute me to something incorruptible and ivory:to something rich and strange. But that would be foolish. The voice of the storm is whispering to me.The voice of the beach is whispering to me.The voice of the waves is whispering to me.

WHEN WE WENT TO SEE THE END OF THE WORLD
by Dawnie Morningside,
age 11 ¼What I did on the founders day holiday was, my dad said we were going to have a picnic, and, my mum said where and I said I wanted to go to Ponydale and ride the ponies, but my dad said we were going to the end of the world and my mum said oh god and my dad said now, Tanya, its time the child got to see what was what and my mum said no, no, she just meant that shed thought that Johnsons Peculiar Garden of Lights was nice this time of year.My mum loves Johnsons Peculiar Garden of Lights, which is in Lux, between 12th street and the river, and I like it too, especially when they give you potato sticks and you feed them to the little white chipmunks who come all the way up to the picnic table.This is the word for the white chipmunks. Albino.Dolorita Hunsickle says that the chipmunks tell your fortune if you catch them but I never did. She says a chipmunk told her she would grow up to be a famous ballerina and that she would die of consumption unloved in a boardinghouse in Prague.So my dad made potato salad.Here is the recipe.My dads potato salad is made with tiny new potatoes, which he boils, then while their warm he pours his secret mix over them which is mayonnaise and sour cream and little onion things called chives which he sotays in bacon fat, and crunchy bacon bits. When it gets cool its the best potato salad in the world, and better than the potato salad we get at school which tastes like white sick.We stopped at the shop and got fruit and Coca-cola and potato sticks, and they went into the box and it went into the back of the car and we went into the car and mum and dad and my baby sister, We Are On Our Way!Where our house is, it is morning, when we leave, and we got onto the motorway and we went over the bridge over twilight, and soon it got dark. I love driving through the dark.I sit in the back of the car and I got all scrunched singing songs that go lah lah lah in the back of my head so my dad has to go, Dawnie darling stop making that noise, but still I go lah lah lah.Lah lah lah.The motorway was closed for repairs so we followed signs and this is what they said: DIVERSION.Mummy made dad lock his door, while we were driving, and she made me to lock my door too.It got more darker as we went.This is what I saw while we drived through the center of the city, out of the window. I saw a beardy man who ran out when we stopped at the lights and ran a smeary cloth all over our windows.He winked at me through the window, in the back of the car, with his old eyes.Then he wasnt there any more, and mummy and daddy had an arguement about who he was, and whether he was good luck or bad luck. But not a bad arguement.Their were more signs that said DIVERSION, and they were yellow.I saw a street where the prettiest men Id ever seen blew us kisses and sung songs, and a street where I saw a woman holding the side of her face under a blue light but her face was bleeding and wet, and a street where there were only cats who stared at us.My sister went loo loo, which means look and she said kitty.The baby is called Melicent, but I call her Daisydaisy. Its my secret name for her. Its from a song called Daisydaisy, which goes, Daisydaisy give me your answer do Im half crazy over the love of you it wont be a stylish marriage I cant afford a carriage but youll look sweet upon the seat of a bicicle made for two.Then we were out of the city, into the hills.Then there were houses that were like palaces on each side of the road, set far back.My dad was born in one of those houses, and he and mummy had the arguement about money where he says what he threw away to be with her and she says oh, so your bringing that up again are you?I looked at the houses. I asked my Daddy which one Grandmother lived in. He said he didnt know, which he was lying. I dont know why grownups fib so much, like when they say Ill tell you later or well see when they mean no or I wont tell you at all even when your older.In one house there were people dancing in the garden. Then the road began to wind around, and daddy was driving us through the countryside through the dark.Look! said my mother. A white deer ran across the road with people chasing it. My dad said they were a nuisance and they were a pest and like rats with antlers, and the worst bit of hitting a deer is when it comes through the glass into the car and he said he had a friend who was kicked to death by a deer who came through the glass with sharp hooves.And mummy said oh god like we really needed to know that, and daddy said well it happened Tanya, and mummy said honestly your incorigible.I wanted to ask who the people chasing the deer was, but I started to sing instead going lah lah lah lah lah lah.My dad said stop that. My mum said for gods sake let the girl express herself, and Dad said I bet you like chewing tinfoil too and my mummy said so whats that supposed to mean and Daddy said nothing and I said arent we there yet?On the side of the road there were bonfires, and sometimes piles of bones.We stopped on one side of a hill. The end of the world was on the other side of the hill, said my dad.I wondered what it looked like. We parked the car in the car park. We got out. Mummy carried Daisy. Daddy carried the picnic basket. We walked over the hill, in the light of the candles they set by the path. A unicorn came up to me on the way. It was white as snow, and it nuzzled me with its mouth.I asked daddy if I could give it an apple and he said it probably has fleas, and Mummy said it didnt. and all the time its tail went swish swish swish.I offered it my apple it looked at me with big silver eyes and then it snorted like this, hrrrmph, and ran away over the hill.Baby Daisy said loo loo.This is what it looks like at the end of the world, which is the best place in the world.There is a hole in the ground, which looks like a very wide big hole and pretty people holding sticks and simatars that burn come up out of it. They have long golden hair. They look like princesses, only fierce. Some of them have wings and some of them dusnt.And theres a big hole in the sky too and things are coming down from it, like the cat-heady man, and the snakes made out of stuff that looks like glitter-jel like I putted on my hair at Hallowmorn, and I saw something that looked like a big old buzzie fly, coming down from the sky. There were very many of them. As many as stars.They dont move. They just hang there, not doing anything. I asked Daddy why they weren't moving and he said they were moving just very very slowly but I dont think so.We set up at a picnic table.Daddy said the best thing about the end of the world was no wasps and no moskitos. And mummy said there werent alot of wasps in Johnsons Peculiar Garden of Lights either. I said there werent alot of wasps or moskitos at Ponydale and there were ponies too we could ride on and my Dad said hed brought us here to enjoy ourselves.I said I wanted to go over to see if I could see the unicorn again and mummy and daddy said dont go too far.At the next table to us were people with masks on. I went off with Daisydaisy to see them.They sang Happy Birthday to you to a big fat lady with no clothes on, and a big funny hat. She had lots of bosoms all the way down to her tummy. I waited to see her blow out the candles on her cake, but there wasnt a cake.Arent you going to make a wish? I said.She said she couldnt make any more wishes. She was too old. I told her that at my last birthday when I blew out my candles all in one go I had thought about my wish for a long time, and I was going to wish that mummy and Daddy wouldn't argue any more in the night. But in the end I wished for a shetland pony but it never come.The lady gave me a cuddle and said I was so cute that she could just eat me all up, bones and hair and everything. She smelled like sweet dried milk.Then Daisydaisy started to cry with all her might and mane, and the lady putted me down.I shouted and called for the unicorn, but I didnt see him. Sometimes I thought I could hear a trumpet, and sometimes I thought it was just the noise in my ears.Then we came back to the table. Whats after the end of the world I said to my dad. Nothing he said. Nothing at all. Thats why its called the end.Then Daisy was sick over Daddys shoes, and we cleaned it up.I sat by the table. We ate potato salad, which I gave you the recipe for all ready, you should make it its really good, and we drank orange juice and potato sticks and squishy egg and cress sandwiches. We drank our Coca-cola.Then Mummy said something to Daddy I didnt hear and he just hit her in the face with a big hit with his hand, and mummy started to cry.Daddy told me to take Daisy and walk about while they talked.I took Daisy and I said come on Daisydaisy, come on old daisybell because she was crying too, but Im too old to cry.I couldnt hear what they were saying. I looked up at the cat face man and I tried to see if he was moving very very slowly, and I heard the trumpet at the end of the world in my head going dah dah dah.We sat by a rock and I sang songs to Daisy lah lah lah lah lah to the sound of the trumpet in my head dah dah dah.Lah lah lah lah lah lah lah lah.Lah lah lah.Then mummy and daddy came over to me and they said we were going home. But that everything was really all right. Mummys eye was all purple. She looked funny, like a lady on the television.Daisy said owie. I told her yes, it was an owie. We got back in the car.On the way home, nobody said anything. The baby sleeped.There was a dead animal by the side of the road somebody had hit with a car. Daddy said it was a white deer. I thought it was the unicorn, but mummy told me that you cant kill unicorns but I think she was lying like grownups do again.When we got to Twilight I said, if you told someone your wish, did that mean it wouldnt come true?What wish, said Daddy?Your birthday wish. When you blow out the candles.He said, Wishes dont come true whether you tell them or not. Wishes, he said. He said you cant trust wishes.I asked Mummy, and she said, whatever your father says, she said in her cold voice, which is the one she uses when she tells me off with my whole name.Then I sleeped too.And then we were home, and it was morning, and I dont want to see the end of the world again. And before I got out of the car, while mummy was carrying in Daisydaisy to the house, I closed my eyes so I couldn't see anything at all, and I wished and I wished and I wished and I wished. I wished wed gone to Ponydale. I wished wed never gone anywhere at all. I wished I was somebody else.And I wished.

DESERT WIND
There was an old man with skin baked black by the desert sunwho told me that, when he was young, a storm had separated him from his caravanand its spices, and he walked over rock and over sand for days and nights,seeing nothing but small lizards and sand-colored rats. But that, on the third day, he came upon a city of silken tentsof all bright colors. A woman led him into the largest tent,crimson the silk was, and set a tray in front of him, gave him iced sherbetto drink, and cushions to lie upon, and then, with scarlet lips, she kissed his brow. Veiled dancers undulated in front of him, bellies like sand dunes,Eyes like pools of dark water in oases, purple were all their silks,and their rings were gold. He watched the dancers while servants brought him food,all kinds of food, and wine as white as silk and wine as red as sin. And then, the wine making good madness in his belly and his head, he jumped up,into the midst of the dancers, and danced with them, feet stamping on the sand,jumping and pounding, and he took the fairest of all the dancersin his arms and kissed her. But his lips pressed to a dry and desert-pitted skull. And each dancer in purple had become bones, but still they curved and stampedin their dance. And he felt the city of tents then like dry sand, hissing and escapingthrough his fingers, and he shivered, and buried his head in his burnous,And sobbed, so he could no longer hear the drums. He was alone, he said, when he awoke. The tents were gone and the ifreets.The sky was blue, the sun was pitiless. That was a lifetime ago.He lived to tell the tale. He laughed with toothless gums, and told us this:He has seen the city of silken tents on the horizon since, dancing in the haze. I asked him if it were a mirage, and he said yes. I said it was a dream,and he agreed, but said it was the desert's dream, not his. And he told me thatin a year or so, when he had aged enough for any man, then he would walkinto the wind, until he saw the tents. This time, he said, he would go on with them.

TASTINGS
He had a tattoo on his upper arm, of a small heart, done in blue and red. Beneath it was a patch of pink skin, where a name had been erased.He was licking her left nipple, slowly. His right hand was caressing the back of her neck.""What's wrong?"" she asked.He looked up. ""What do you mean?""""You seem like you're. I don't know. Somewhere else,"" she said. ""Oh . . . that's nice. That's really nice.""They were in a hotel suite. It was her suite. He knew who she was, had recognized her on sight, but had been warned not to use her name.He moved his head up to look into her eyes, moved his hand down to her breast. They were both naked from the waist up. She had a silk skirt on; he wore blue jeans.""Well?"" she said.He put his mouth against hers. Their lips touched. Her tongue flickered against his. She sighed, pulled back. ""So what's wrong? Don't you like me?""He grinned, reassuringly. ""Like you? I think you're wonderful,"" he said. He hugged her, tightly. Then his hand cupped her left breast, and, slowly, squeezed it. She closed her eyes.""Well, then,"" she whispered, ""what's wrong?""""Nothing,"" he said. ""It's wonderful. You're wonderful. You're very beautiful.""""My ex-husband used to say that I used my beauty,' she told him. She ran the back of her hand across the front of his jeans, up and down. He pushed against her, arching his back. ""I suppose he was right."" She knew the name he had given her, but, certain that it was false, a name of convenience, would not call him by it.He touched her cheek. Then he moved his mouth back to her nipple. This time, as he licked, he moved a hand down between her legs. The silk of her dress was soft against his hand, and he cupped his fingers against her pubis and slowly increased the pressure.""Anyway, something's wrong,"" she said. ""There's something going on in that pretty head of yours. Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?""""It's silly,"" he said. ""And I'm not here for me. I'm here for you.""She undid the buttons of his jeans. He rolled over and slid them off, dropping them onto the floor by the bed. He wore thin scarlet underpants, and his erect penis pushed against the material.While he took off his jeans, she removed her earrings; they were made of elaborately looped silver wires. She placed them carefully beside the bed.He laughed, suddenly.""What was that about?"" she asked.""Just a memory. Strip poker,"" he said. ""When I was a kid, I don't know, thirteen or fourteen, we used to play with the girls next door. They'd always load up with tchotchkes-necklaces, earrings, scarves, things like that. So when they'd lose, they'd take off one earring or whatever. Ten minutes in, we'd be nude and embarrassed, and they'd still be fully dressed.""""So why'd you play with them?""""Hope,"" he said. He reached beneath her dress, began to massage her labia through her white cotton panties. ""Hope that maybe we'd get a glimpse of something. Anything.""""And did you?""He pulled his hand away, rolled on top of her. They kissed. They pushed as they kissed, gently, crotch to crotch. Her hands squeezed the cheeks of his ass. He shook his head. ""No. But you can always dream.""""So. What's silly? And why wouldn't I understand?""""Because it's dumb. Because . . . I don't know what you're thinking.""She pulled down his Jockey shorts. Ran her forefinger along the side of his penis. ""It's really big. Natalie said it would be.""""Yeah?""""I'm not the first person to tell you that it's big.""""No.""She lowered her head, kissed his penis at the base, where the spring of golden hair brushed it, then she dribbled a little saliva onto it and ran her tongue slowly up its length. She pulled back after that, stared into his blue eyes with her brown ones.""You don't know what I'm thinking? What does that mean? Do you normally know what other people are thinking?""He shook his head. ""Well,"" he said. ""Not exactly.""""Hold that thought,"" she said. ""I'll be right back.""She got up, walked into the bathroom, closed the door behind her but did not lock it. There was the sound of urine splashing into a toilet bowl. It seemed to go on for a long time. The toilet was flushed; the sound of movement in the bathroom, a cupboard opening, closing; more movements.She opened the door and came out. She was quite naked now. She looked, for the first time, slightly self-conscious. He was sitting on the bed, also naked. His hair was blond and cut very short. As she came close to him, he reached out his hands, held her waist, pulled her close to him. His face was level with her navel. He licked it, then lowered his head to her crotch, pushed his tongue between her long labia, lapped and licked.She began to breathe faster.While he tongued her clitoris, he pushed a finger into her vagina. It was already wet, and the finger slid in easily.He slid his other hand down her back to the curve of her ass and let it remain there.""So. Do you always know what people are thinking?""He pulled his head back, her juices on his mouth. ""It's a bit stupid. I mean, I don't really want to talk about it. You'll think I'm weird.""She reached down, tipped his chin up, kissed him. She bit his lip, not too hard, pulled at it with her teeth.""You are weird. But I like it when you talk. And I want to know what's wrong, Mister Mind Reader.""She sat next to him on the bed. ""You have terrific breasts,"" he told her. ""Really lovely.""She made a moue. ""They're not as good as they used to be. And don't change the subject.'""I'm not changing the subject."" He lay back on the bed. ""I can't really read minds. But I sort of can. When I'm in bed with someone. I know what makes them tick.""She climbed on top of him, sat on his stomach. ""You're kidding.""""No.""He fingered her clitoris gently. She squirmed. ""Nice."" She moved back six inches. Now she was sitting on his penis, pushed flat between them. She moved on it.""I know . . . I usually . . . do you know how hard it to concentrate with you doing that?""""Talk,"" she said. ""Talk to me.""""Put it in you.""She reached down one hand, held his penis. She lifted herself up slightly, squatted down on his penis, feeding the head inside her. He arched his back, pushed up into her. She closed her eyes, then opened them and stared at him. ""Well?""""It's just that when I'm fucking, or even in the time before fucking, well . . . I know things. Things I honestly don't know-or can't know. Things I don't want to know even. Abuse. Abortions. Madness. Incest. Whether they're secret sadists or stealing from their bosses.""""For example?""He was all the way in her now, thrusting slowly in and out. Her hands were resting on his shoulders. She leaned down, kissed him on the lips.""Well, like it works with sex, too. Usually I know how I'm doing. In bed. With women. I know what to do. I don't have to ask. I know. If she needs a top or a bottom, a master or a slave. If she needs me to whisper 'I love you' over and over while I fuck her and we lie side by side, or just needs me to piss into her mouth. I become what she wants. That's why . . . Jesus. I can't believe I'm telling you this. I mean, that's why I started doing this for a living.""""Yeah. Natalie swears by you. She gave me your number.""""She's so cool. Natalie. And in such great shape for her age.""""And what does Natalie like to do, then?""He smiled up at her. ""Trade secret,"" he said. ""Sworn to secrecy. Scout's honor.""""Hold on,"" she said. She climbed off him, rolled over. ""From behind. I like it from behind.""""I should have known that,"" he said, sounding almost irritated. He got up, positioned himself behind her, ran a finger down the soft skin that covered her spine. He put his hand between her legs, then grasped his penis and pushed it into her vagina.""Really slow,"" she said.He thrust his hips, sliding his penis into her. She gasped.""Is that nice?"" he asked.""No,"" she said. ""It hurt a little when it was all the way in. Not so deep next time. So you know stuff about women when you screw them. What do you know about me?""""Nothing special. I'm a big fan of yours.""""Spare me.""One of his arms was across her breasts. His other hand touched her lips. She sucked at his forefinger, licking it. ""Well, not that big a fan. But I saw you on Letterman, and I thought you were wonderful. Really funny.""""Thanks.""""I can't believe we're doing this.""""Fucking?""""No. Talking while we're fucking.""""I like to talk while I fuck. That's enough like this. My knees are getting tired.""He pulled out and sat back on the bed.""So you knew what women were thinking, and what they wanted? Hmm. Does it work for men?""""I don't know. I've never made love to a man.""She stared at him. Placed a finger on his forehead, ran it slowly down to his chin, tracing the line of his cheekbone on the way. ""But you're so pretty.""""Thank you.""""And you're a whore.""""Escort,"" he said.""Vain, too.""""Perhaps. And you're not?""She grinned. ""Touché. So. You don't know what I want now?""""No.""She lay on her side. ""Put on a condom and fuck me in the ass.""""You got any lubricant?""""Bedside table.""He took the condom and the gel from the drawer, unrolled the condom down his penis.""I hate condoms,"" he told her as he put it on. ""They make me itch. And I've got a clean bill of health. I showed you the certificate.""""I don't care.""""I just thought I'd mention it. That's all.""He rubbed the lubricant into and around her anus, then he slid the head of his penis inside her.She groaned. He paused. ""Is-is that okay?""""Yes.""He rocked back and forth, pushing deeper. She grunted, rhythmically, as he did so. After a couple of minutes she said ""Enough.""He pulled out. She rolled onto her back and pulled the soiled condom off his penis, dropped it onto the carpet.""You can come now,"" she told him.""I'm not ready. And we could go for hours yet.""""I don't care. Come on my stomach."" She smiled at him. ""Make yourself come. Now.""He shook his head, but his hand was already fumbling at his penis, jerking it forward and back until he spurted in a glistening trail all over her stomach and breasts.She reached a hand down and rubbed the milky semen lazily across her skin.""I think you should go now,"" she said.""But you didn't come. Don't you want me to make you come?""""I got what I wanted.""He shook his head, confusedly. His penis was flaccid and shrunken. ""I should have known,"" he said, puzzled. ""I don't. I don't know. I don't know anything.""""Get dressed,"" she told him. ""Go away.""He pulled on his clothes, efficiently, beginning with his socks. Then he leaned over, to kiss her.She moved her head away from his lips. ""No,"" she said.""Can I see you again?""She shook her head. ""I don't think so.""He was shaking. ""What about the money?"" he asked.""I paid you already,"" she said. ""I paid you when you came in. Don't you remember?""He nodded, nervously, as if he could not remember but dared not admit it. Then he patted his pockets until he found the envelope with the cash in it, and he nodded once more. ""I feel so empty,"" he said, plaintively.She scarcely noticed when he left.She lay on the bed with a hand on her stomach, his spermatic fluid drying cold on her skin, and she tasted him in her mind.She tasted each woman he had slept with. She tasted what he did with her friend, smiling inside at Natalie's tiny perversities. She tasted the day he lost his first job. She tasted the morning he had awakened, still drunk, in his car, in the middle of a cornfield, and, terrified, had sworn off the bottle for ever. She knew his real name. She remembered the name that had once been tattoed on his arm and knew why it could be there no longer. She tasted the color of his eyes from the inside, and shivered at the nightmare he had in which he was forced to carry spiny fish in his mouth, and from which he woke, choking, night after night. She savored his hungers in food and fiction, and discovered a dark sky when he was a small boy and he had stared up at the stars and wondered at their vastness and immensity, that even he had forgotten.Even in the pettiest, most unpromising material, she had discovered, you could find real treasures. And he had a little of the talent himself, although he had never understood it, or used it for anything more than sex. She wondered, as she swam in his memories and dreams, if he would miss them, if he would ever notice that they were gone. And then, shuddering, ecstatic, she came, in bright flashes, which warmed her and took her out of herself and into the nowhere-at-all perfection of the little death.There was a crash from the alley below. Someone had stumbled into a garbage can.She sat up and wiped the stickiness from her skin. And then, without showering, she began to dress herself once more, deliberately, beginning with her white cotton panties and ending with her elaborate silver earrings.

A few years back all the animals went away.We woke up one morning, and they just weren't there anymore. They didn't even leave us a note, or say good-bye. We never figured out quite where they'd gone.We missed them.Some of us thought that the world had ended, but it hadn't. There just weren't any more animals. No cats or rabbits, no dogs or whales, no fish in the seas, no birds in the skies.We were all alone.We didn't know what to do.We wandered around lost, for a time, and then someone pointed out that just because we didn't have animals anymore, that was no reason to change our lives. No reason to change our diets or to cease testing products that might cause us harm.After all, there were still babies.Babies can't talk. They can hardly move. A baby is not a rational, thinking creature.We made babies.And we used them.Some of them we ate. Baby flesh is tender and succulent.We flayed their skin and decorated ourselves in it. Baby leather is soft and comfortable.Some of them we tested.We taped open their eyes, dripped detergents and shampoos in, a drop at a time.We scarred them and scalded them. We burnt them. We clamped them and planted electrodes into their brains. We grafted, and we froze, and we irradiated.The babies breathed our smoke, and the babies' veins flowed with our medicines and drugs, until they stopped breathing or until their blood ceased to flow.It was hard, of course, but it was necessary.No one could deny that.With the animals gone, what else could we do?Some people complained, of course. But then, they always do.And everything went back to normal.Only . . .Yesterday, all the babies were gone.We don't know where they went. We didn't even see them go.We don't know what we're going to do without them.But we'll think of something. Humans are smart. It's what makes us superior to the animals and the babies.We'll figure something out.

The Fourth Angel says:Of this order I am made one,From Mankind to guard this placeThat through their Guilt they have foregoneFor they have forfeited His Grace;Therefore all this must they shunOr else my Sword they shall embraceAnd myself will be their Foe To flame them in the Face.- CHESTER MYSTERY CYCLE,THE CREATION AND ADAM AND EVE, 1461This is true.Ten years ago, give or take a year, I found myself on an enforced stopover in Los Angeles, a long way from home. It was December, and the California weather was warm and pleasant. England, however, was in the grip of fogs and snowstorms, and no planes were landing there. Each day I'd phone the airport, and each day I'd be told to wait another day.This had gone on for almost a week.I was barely out of my teens. Looking around today at the parts of my life left over from those days, I feel uncomfortable, as if I've received a gift, unasked, from another person: a house, a wife, children, a vocation. Nothing to do with me, I could say, innocently. If it's true that every seven years each cell in your body dies and is replaced, then I have truly inherited my life from a dead man; and the misdeeds of those times have been forgiven, and are buried with his bones.I was in Los Angeles. Yes.On the sixth day I received a message from an old sort-of-girlfriend from Seattle: she was in L.A., too, and she had heard I was around on the friends-of-friends network. Would I come over?I left a message on her machine. Sure.That evening: a small, blonde woman approached me as I came out of the place I was staying. It was already dark.She stared at me, as if she were trying to match me to a description, and then, hesitantly, she said my name.""That's me. Are you Tink's friend?""""Yeah. Car's out back. C'mon. She's really looking forward to seeing you.""The woman's car was one of the huge old boatlike jobs you only ever seem to see in California. It smelled of cracked and flaking leather upholstery. We drove out from wherever we were to wherever we were going.Los Angeles was at that time a complete mystery to me; and I cannot say I understand it much better now. I understand London, and New York, and Paris: you can walk around them, get a sense of what's where in just a morning of wandering, maybe catch the subway. But Los Angeles is about cars. Back then I didn't drive at all; even today I will not drive in America. Memories of L.A. for me are linked by rides in other people's cars, with no sense there of the shape of the city, of the relationships between the people and the place. The regularity of the roads, the repetition of structure and form, mean that when I try to remember it as an entity, all I have is the boundless profusion of tiny lights I saw from the hill of Griffith Park one night, on my first trip to the city. It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen, from that distance.""See that building?"" said my blonde driver, Tink's friend. It was a redbrick Art Deco house, charming and quite ugly.""Yes.""""Built in the 1930s,"" she said, with respect and pride.I said something polite, trying to comprehend a city inside which fifty years could be considered a long time.""Tink's real excited. When she heard you were in town. She was so excited.""""I'm looking forward to seeing her again.""Tink's real name was Tinkerbell Richmond. No lie.She was staying with friends in a small apartment clump, somewhere an hour's drive from downtown L.A.What you need to know about Tink: she was ten years older than me, in her early thirties; she had glossy black hair and red, puzzled lips, and very white skin, like Snow White in the fairy stories; the first time I met her I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world.Tink had been married for a while at some point in her life and had a five-year-old daughter called Susan. I had never met Susan-when Tink had been in England, Susan had been staying on in Seattle, with her father.People named Tinkerbell name their daughters Susan.Memory is the great deceiver. Perhaps there are some individuals whose memories act like tape recordings, daily records of their lives complete in every detail, but I am not one of them. My memory is a patchwork of occurrences, of discontinuous events roughly sewn together: The parts I remember, I remember precisely, whilst other sections seem to have vanished completely.I do not remember arriving at Tink's house, nor where her flatmate went.What I remember next is sitting in Tink's lounge with the lights low, the two of us next to each other, on her sofa.We made small talk. It had been perhaps a year since we had seen one another. But a twenty-one-year-old boy has little to say to a thirty-two-year-old woman, and soon, having nothing in common, I pulled her to me.She snuggled close with a kind of sigh, and presented her lips to be kissed. In the half-light her lips were black. We kissed for a little on the couch, and I stroked her breasts through her blouse and then she said:""We can't fuck. I'm on my period.""""Fine.""""I can give you a blowjob, if you'd like.""I nodded assent, and she unzipped my jeans, and lowered her head to my lap.After I had come, she got up and ran into the kitchen. I heard her spitting into the sink, and the sound of running water: I remember wondering why she did it, if she hated the taste that much.Then she returned and we sat next to each other on the couch.""Susan's upstairs, asleep,"" said Tink. ""She's all I live for. Would you like to see her?""""I don't mind.""We went upstairs. Tink led me into a darkened bedroom. There were child-scrawl pictures all over the walls-wax-crayoned drawings of winged fairies and little palaces-and a small fair-haired girl was asleep in the bed.""She's very beautiful,"" said Tink, and kissed me. Her lips were still slightly sticky. ""She takes after her father.""We went downstairs. We had nothing else to say, nothing else to do. Tink turned on the main light. For the first time, I noticed tiny crow's feet at the corners of her eyes, incongruous on her perfect Barbie doll face.""I love you,"" she said.""Thank you.""""Would you like a ride back?""""If you don't mind leaving Susan alone . . .""She shrugged, and I pulled her to me for the last time.At night Los Angles is all lights. And shadows. A blank, here, in my mind. I simply don't remember what happened next. She must have driven me back to the place where I was staying-how else would I have gotten there? I do not even remember kissing her good-bye. Perhaps I simply waited on the sidewalk and watched her drive away.Perhaps.I do know, however, that once I reached the place I was staying, I just stood there, unable to go inside, to wash, and then to sleep, unwilling to do anything else.I was not hungry. I did not want alcohol. I did not want to read or talk. I was scared of walking too far, in case I became lost, bedeviled by the repeating motifs of Los Angeles, spun around and sucked in so I could never find my way home again. Central Los Angeles sometimes seems to me to be nothing more than a pattern, like a set of repeating blocks: a gas station, a few homes, a mini-mall (doughnuts, photo developers, Laundromats, fast foods), and repeat until hypnotized; and the tiny changes in the mini-malls and the houses only serve to reinforce the structure.I thought of Tink's lips. Then I fumbled in a pocket of my jacket and pulled out a packet of cigarettes.I lit one, inhaled, blew blue smoke into the warm night air.There was a stunted palm tree growing outside the place I was staying, and I resolved to walk for a way, keeping the tree in sight, to smoke my cigarette, perhaps even to think; but I felt too drained to think. I felt very sexless, and very alone.A block or so down the road there was a bench, and when I reached it I sat down. I threw the stub of the cigarette onto the pavement, hard, and watched it shower orange sparks.Someone said, ""I'll buy a cigarette off you, pal. Here.""A hand in front of my face, holding a quarter. I looked up. He did not look old, although I would not have been prepared to say how old he was. Late thirties, perhaps. Mid-forties. He wore a long, shabby coat, colorless under the yellow streetlamps, and his eyes were dark.""Here. A quarter. That's a good price.""I shook my head, pulled out the packet of Marlboros, offered him one. ""Keep your money. It's free. Have it.""He took the cigarette. I passed him a book of matches (it advertised a telephone sex line; I remember that), and he lit the cigarette. He offered me the matches back, and I shook my head. ""Keep them. I always wind up accumulating books of matches in America.""""Uh-huh."" He sat next to me and smoked his cigarette. When he had smoked it halfway down, he tapped the lighted end off on the concrete, stubbed out the glow, and placed the butt of the cigarette behind his ear.""I don't smoke much,"" he said. ""Seems a pity to waste it, though.""A car careened down the road, veering from one side to the other. There were four young men in the car; the two in the front were both pulling at the wheel and laughing. The windows were wound down, and I could hear their laughter, and the two in the backseat (""Gaary, you asshole! What the fuck are you onnn, mannnn?""), and the pulsing beat of a rock song. Not a song I recognized. The car looped around a corner, out of sight.Soon the sounds were gone, too.""I owe you,"" said the man on the bench.""Sorry?""""I owe you something. For the cigarette. And the matches. You wouldn't take the money. I owe you.""I shrugged, embarrassed. ""Really, it's just a cigarette. I figure, if I give people cigarettes, then if ever I'm out, maybe people will give me cigarettes."" I laughed, to show I didn't really mean it, although I did. ""Don't worry about it.""""Mm. You want to hear a story? True story? Stories always used to be good payment. These days . . .""-he shrugged-"". . . not so much.""I sat back on the bench, and the night was warm, and I looked at my watch: it was almost one in the morning. In England a freezing new day would already have begun: a workday would be starting for those who could beat the snow and get into work; another handful of old people, and those without homes, would have died, in the night, from the cold.""Sure,"" I said to the man. ""Sure. Tell me a story.""He coughed, grinned white teeth-a flash in the darkness-and he began.""First thing I remember was the Word. And the Word was God. Sometimes, when I get really down, I remember the sound of the Word in my head, shaping me, forming me, giving me life.""The Word gave me a body, gave me eyes. And I opened my eyes, and I saw the light of the Silver city.""I was in a room-a silver room-and there wasn't anything in it except me. In front of me was a window that went from floor to ceiling, open to the sky, and through the window I could see the spires of the City, and at the edge of the City, the Dark.""I don't know how long I waited there. I wasn't impatient or anything, though. I remember that. It was like I was waiting until I was called; and I knew that some time I would be called. And if I had to wait until the end of everything and never be called, why, that was fine, too. But I'd be called, I was certain of that. And then I'd know my name and my function.""Through the window I could see silver spires, and in many of the other spires were windows; and in the windows I could see others like me. That was how I knew what I looked like.""You wouldn't think it of me, seeing me now, but I was beautiful. I've come down in the world a way since then.""I was taller then, and I had wings.""They were huge and powerful wings, with feathers the color of mother-of-pearl. They came out from just between my shoulder blades. They were so good. My wings.""Sometimes I'd see others like me, the ones who'd left their rooms, who were already fulfilling their duties. I'd watch them soar through the sky from spire to spire, performing errands I could barely imagine.""The sky above the City was a wonderful thing. It was always light, although lit by no sun-lit, perhaps, by the City itself; but the quality of light was forever changing. Now pewter-colored light, then brass, then a gentle gold, or a soft and quiet amethyst . . . ""The man stopped talking. He looked at me, his head on one side. There was a glitter in his eyes that scared me. ""You know what amethyst is? A kind of purple stone?""I nodded.My crotch felt uncomfortable.It occurred to me then that the man might not be mad; I found this far more disquieting than the alternative.The man began talking once more. ""I don't know how long it was that I waited in my room. But time didn't mean anything. Not back then. We had all the time in the world.""The next thing that happened to me, was when the Angel Lucifer came to my cell. He was taller than me, and his wings were imposing, his plumage perfect. He had skin the color of sea mist, and curly silver hair, and these wonderful gray eyes . . .""I say he, but you should understand that none of us had any sex, to speak of."" He gestured toward his lap. ""Smooth and empty. Nothing there. You know.""""Lucifer shone. I mean it-he glowed from inside. All angels do. They're lit up from within, and in my cell the Angel Lucifer burned like a lightning storm.""He looked at me. And he named me."" 'You are Raguel,' he said. ' The Vengeance of the Lord.'""I bowed my head, because I knew it was true. That was my name. That was my function."" 'There has been a . . . a wrong thing,' he said. ' The first of its kind. You are needed.'""He turned and pushed himself into space, and I followed him, flew behind him across the Silver city to the outskirts, where the City stops and the Darkness begins; and it was there, under a vast silver spire, that we descended to the street, and I saw the dead angel.""The body lay, crumpled and broken, on the silver sidewalk. Its wings were crushed underneath it and a few loose feathers had already blown into the silver gutter.""The body was almost dark. Now and again a light would flash inside it, an occasional flicker of cold fire in the chest, or in the eyes, or in the sexless groin, as the last of the glow of life left it forever.""Blood pooled in rubies on its chest and stained its white wing feathers crimson. It was very beautiful, even in death.""It would have broken your heart.""Lucifer spoke to me then. 'You must find who was responsible for this, and how; and take the Vengeance of the Name on whosoever caused this thing to happen.'""He really didn't have to say anything. I knew that already. The hunt, and the retribution: it was what I was created for, in the Beginning; it was what I was."" 'I have work to attend to,' said the Angel Lucifer.""He flapped his wings once, hard, and rose upward; the gust of wind sent the dead angel's loose feathers blowing across the street.""I leaned down to examine the body. All luminescence had by now left it. It was a dark thing, a parody of an angel. It had a perfect, sexless face, framed by silver hair. One of the eyelids was open, revealing a placid gray eye; the other was closed. There were no nipples on the chest and only smoothness between the legs.""I lifted the body up.""The back of the angel was a mess. The wings were broken and twisted, the back of the head staved in; there was a floppiness to the corpse that made me think its spine had been broken as well. The back of the angel was all blood.""The only blood on its front was in the chest area. I probed it with my forefinger, and it entered the body without difficulty.""He fell, I thought. And he was dead before he fell.""And I looked up at the windows that ranked the street. I stared across the Silver City. You did this, I thought. I will find you, whoever you are. And I will take the Lord's vengeance upon you.""The man took the cigarette stub from behind his ear, lit it with a match. Briefly I smelled the ashtray smell of a dead cigarette, acrid and harsh; then he pulled down to the unburnt tobacco, exhaled blue smoke into the night air.""The angel who had first discovered the body was called Phanuel.""I spoke to him in the Hall of Being. That was the spire beside which the dead angel lay. In the Hall hung the . . . the blueprints, maybe, for what was going to be . . . all this."" He gestured with the hand that held the stubby cigarette, pointing to the night sky and the parked cars and the world. ""You know. The universe.""""Phanuel was the senior designer; working under him were a multitude of angels laboring on the details of the Creation. I watched him from the floor of the Hall. He hung in the air below the Plan, and angels flew down to him, waiting politely in turn as they asked him questions, checked things with him, invited comment on their work. Eventually he left them and descended to the floor."" 'You are Raguel,' he said. His voice was high and fussy. 'What need have you of me?'"" 'You found the body?'"" 'Poor Carasel? Indeed I did. I was leaving the Hall-there are a number of concepts we are currently constructing, and I wished to ponder one of them, Regret by name. I was planning to get a little distance from the City-to fly above it, I mean, not to go into the Dark outside, I wouldn't do that, although there has been some loose talk amongst . . .but, yes. I was going to rise and contemplate."" 'I left the Hall, and . . .' he broke off. He was small, for an angel. His light was muted, but his eyes were vivid and bright. I mean really bright. 'Poor Carasel. How could he do that to himself? How?'"" 'You think his destruction was self-inflicted?'""He seemed puzzled-surprised that there could be any other explanation. 'But of course. Carasel was working under me, developing a number of concepts that shall be intrinsic to the universe when its Name shall be Spoken. His group did a remarkable job on some of the real basics-Dimension was one, and Sleep another. There were others."" 'Wonderful work. Some of his suggestions regarding the use of individual viewpoints to define dimensions were truly ingenious."" 'Anyway. He had begun work on a new project. It's one of the really major ones-the ones that I would usually handle, or possibly even Zephkiel.' He glanced upward. 'But Carasel had done such sterling work. And his last project was so remarkable. Something apparently quite trivial that he and Saraquael elevated into . . .' he shrugged. 'But that is unimportant. It was this project that forced him into nonbeing. But none of us could ever have foreseen . . .'"" 'What was his current project?'""Phanuel stared at me. 'I'm not sure I ought to tell you. All the new concepts are considered sensitive until we get them into the final form in which they will be Spoken.'""I felt myself transforming. I am not sure how I can explain it to you, but suddenly I wasn't me-I was something larger. I was transfigured: I was my function.""Phanuel was unable to meet my gaze."" 'I am Raguel, who is the Vengeance of the Lord,' I told him. 'I serve the Name directly. It is my mission to discover the nature of this deed, and to take the Name's vengeance on those responsible. My questions are to be answered.'""The little angel trembled, and he spoke fast."" 'Carasel and his partner were researching Death. Cessation of life. An end to physical, animated existence. They were putting it all together. But Carasel always went too far into his work-we had a terrible time with him when he was designing Agitation. That was when he was working on Emotions . . .'"" 'You think Carasel died to-to research the phenomenon?'"" 'Or because it intrigued him. Or because he followed his research just too far. Yes.' Phanuel flexed his fingers, stared at me with those brightly shining eyes. 'I trust that you will repeat none of this to any unauthorized persons, Raguel.'"" 'What did you do when you found the body?'"" 'I came out of the Hall, as I said, and there was Carasel on the sidewalk, staring up. I asked him what he was doing, and he did not reply. Then I noticed the inner fluid, and that Carasel seemed unable, rather than unwilling, to talk to me."" 'I was scared. I did not know what to do."" The Angel Lucifer came up behind me. He asked me if there was some kind of problem. I told him. I showed him the body. And then . . . then his Aspect came upon him, and he communed with the Name. He burned so bright."" 'Then he said he had to fetch the one whose function embraced events like this, and he left-to seek you, I imagine."" 'As Carasel's death was now being dealt with, and his fate was no real concern of mine, I returned to work, having gained a new-and, I suspect, quite valuable-perspective on the mechanics of Regret."" 'I am considering taking Death away from the Carasel and Saraquael partnership. I may reassign it to Zephkiel, my senior partner, if he is willing to take it on. He excels on contemplative projects.'""By now there was a line of angels waiting to talk to Phanuel. I felt I had almost all I was going to get from him."" 'Who did Carasel work with? Who would have been the last to see him alive?'"" 'You could talk to Saraquael, I suppose-he was his partner, after all. Now, if you'll excuse me. . .'""He returned to his swarm of aides: advising, correcting, suggesting, forbidding.""The man paused.The street was quiet now; I remember the low whisper of his voice, the buzz of a cricket somewhere. A small animal-a cat perhaps, or something more exotic, a raccoon, or even a jackal-darted from shadow to shadow among the parked cars on the opposite side of the street.""Saraquael was in the highest of the mezzanine galleries that ringed the Hall of Being. As I said, the universe was in the middle of the Hall, and it glinted and sparkled and shone. Went up quite a way, too . . .""""The universe you mention, it was, what, a diagram?"" I asked, interrupting for the first time.""Not really. Kind of. Sorta. It was a blueprint; but it was full-sized, and it hung in the Hall, and all these angels went around and fiddled with it all the time. Doing stuff with Gravity and Music and Klar and whatever. It wasn't really the universe, not yet. It would be, when it was finished, and it was time for it to be properly Named.""""But . . ."" I grasped for words to express my confusion. The man interrupted me.""Don't worry about it. Think of it as a model if that makes it easier for you. Or a map. Or a-what's the word? Prototype. Yeah. A Model-T Ford universe."" He grinned. ""You got to understand, a lot of the stuff I'm telling you, I'm translating already; putting it in a form you can understand. Otherwise I couldn't tell the story at all. You want to hear it?""""Yes."" I didn't care if it was true or not; it was a story I needed to hear all the way through to the end.""Good. So shut up and listen.""So I met Saraquael in the topmost gallery. There was no one else about-just him, and some papers, and some small, glowing models."" 'I've come about Carasel,' I told him.""He looked at me. 'Carasel isn't here at this time,' he said. 'I expect him to return shortly.'""I shook my head."" 'Carasel won't be coming back. He's stopped existing as a spiritual entity,' I said.""His light paled, and his eyes opened very wide. ' He's dead?'"" 'That's what I said. Do you have any ideas about how it happened?'"" 'I . . . this is so sudden. I mean, he'd been talking about . . . but I had no idea that he would . . . '"" 'Take it slowly.'""Saraquael nodded.""He stood up and walked to the window. There was no view of the Silver City from his window-just a reflected glow from the City and the sky behind us, hanging in the air, and beyond that, the Dark. The wind from the Dark gently caressed Saraquael's hair as he spoke. I stared at his back."" 'Carasel is . . . no, was. That's right, isn't it? Was. He was always so involved. And so creative. But it was never enough for him. He always wanted to understand everything-to experience what he was working on. He was never content to just create it-to understand it intellectually. He wanted all of it."" 'That wasn't a problem before, when we were working on properties of matter. But when we began to design some of the Named emotions . . . he got too involved with his work."" 'And our latest project was Death. It's one of the hard ones-one of the big ones, too, I suspect. Possibly it may even become the attribute that's going to define the Creation for the Created: If not for Death, they'd be content to simply exist, but with Death, well, their lives will have meaning-a boundary beyond which the living cannot cross . . .'"" 'So you think he killed himself?'"" 'I know he did,' said Saraquael. I walked to the window and looked out. Far below, a long way, I could see a tiny white dot. That was Carasel's body. I'd have to arrange for someone to take care of it. I wondered what we would do with it; but there would be someone who would know, whose function was the removal of unwanted things. It was not my function. I knew that."" 'How?'""He shrugged. ' I know. Recently he'd begun asking questions-questions about Death. How we could know whether or not it was right to make this thing, to set the rules, if we were not going to experience it ourselves. He kept talking about it.'"" 'Didn't you wonder about this?'""Saraquael turned, for the first time, to look at me. 'No. That is our function-to discuss, to improvise, to aid the Creation and the Created. We sort it out now, so that when it all Begins, it'll run like clockwork. Right now we're working on Death. So obviously that's what we look at. The physical aspect; the emotional aspect; the philosophical aspect . . ."" 'And the patterns. Carasel had the notion that what we do here in the Hall of Being creates patterns. That there are structures and shapes appropriate to beings and events that, once begun, must continue until they reach their end. For us, perhaps, as well as for them. Conceivably he felt this was one of his patterns.'"" 'Did you know Carasel well?'"" 'As well as any of us know each other. We saw each other here; we worked side by side. At certain times I would retire to my cell across the City. Sometimes he would do the same.'""Tell me about Phanuel.'""His mouth crooked into a smile. 'He's officious. Doesn't do much-farms everything out and takes all the credit.' He lowered his voice, although there was no other soul in the gallery. 'To hear him talk, you'd think that Love was all his own work. But to his credit, he does make sure the work gets done. Zephkiel's the real thinker of the two senior designers, but he doesn't come here. He stays back in his cell in the City and contemplates; resolves problems from a distance. If you need to speak to Zephkiel, you go to Phanuel, and Phanuel relays your questions to Zephkiel . . . '""I cut him short. 'How about Lucifer? Tell me about him.'"" 'Lucifer? The Captain of the Host? He doesn't work here . . . He has visited the Hall a couple of times, though-inspecting the Creation. They say he reports directly to the Name. I have never spoken to him.'"" 'Did he know Carasel?'"" 'I doubt it. As I said, he has only been here twice. I have seen him on other occasions, though. Through here."" He flicked a wingtip, indicating the world outside the window. ""In flight.'"" 'Where to?'""Saraquael seemed to be about to say something, then he changed his mind. ' I don't know.'""I looked out of the window at the Darkness outside the Silver City.""I may want to talk with you some more, later,' I told Saraquael."" 'Very good."" I turned to go. "" 'Sir? Do you know if they will be assigning me another partner? For Death?'"" 'No,' I told him. 'I'm afraid I don't.'""In the center of the Silver City was a park-a place of recreation and rest. I found the Angel Lucifer there, beside a river. He was just standing, watching the water flow."" 'Lucifer?'""He inclined his head. 'Raguel. Are you making progress?'"" 'I don't know. Maybe. I need to ask you a few questions. Do you mind?'"" 'Not at all.'"" 'How did you come upon the body?'"" 'I didn't. Not exactly. I saw Phanuel standing in the street. He looked distressed. I inquired whether there was something wrong, and he showed me the dead angel. And I fetched you.'"" 'I see.'""He leaned down, let one hand enter the cold water of the river. The water splashed and rolled around it. 'Is that all?'"" 'Not quite. What were you doing in that part of the city?'"" 'I don't see what business that is of yours.'"" 'It is my business, Lucifer. What were you doing there?'"" 'I was . . . walking. I do that sometimes. Just walk and think. And try to understand.' He shrugged."" 'You walk on the edge of the City?'""A beat, then 'Yes.'"" 'That's all I want to know. For now.'"" 'Who else have you talked to?"""" 'Carasel's boss and his partner. They both feel that he killed himself-ended his own life.'"" 'Who else are you going to talk to?'""I looked up. The spires of the City of the Angels towered above us. 'Maybe everyone.'"" 'All of them?'"" 'If I need to. It's my function. I cannot rest until I understand what happened, and until the Vengeance of the Name has been taken on whosoever was responsible. But I'll tell you something I do know.'"" 'What would that be?' Drops of water fell like diamonds from the Angel Lucifer's perfect fingers."" 'Carasel did not kill himself.'"" 'How do you know that?"""" 'I am Vengeance. If Carasel had died by his own hand,' I explained to the Captain of the Heavenly Host, 'there would have been no call for me. Would there?'""He did not reply.""I flew upward into the light of the eternal morning.""You got another cigarette on you?""I fumbled out the red and white packet, handed him a cigarette.""Obliged.""Zephkiel's cell was larger than mine.""It wasn't a place for waiting. It was a place to live, and work, and be. It was lined with books, and scrolls, and papers, and there were images and representations on the walls: pictures. I'd never seen a picture before.""In the center of the room was a large chair, and Zephkiel sat there, his eyes closed, his head back.""As I approached him, he opened his eyes.""They burned no brighter than the eyes of any of the other angels I had seen, but somehow they seemed to have seen more. It was something about the way he looked. I'm not sure I can explain it. And he had no wings."" 'Welcome, Raguel,' he said. He sounded tired."" 'You are Zephkiel?' I don't know why I asked him that. I mean, I knew who people were. It's part of my function, I guess. Recognition. I know who you are."" 'Indeed. You are staring, Raguel. I have no wings, it is true, but then my function does not call for me to leave this cell. I remain here, and I ponder. Phanuel reports back to me, brings me the new things, for my opinion. He brings me the problems, and I think about them, and occasionally I make myself useful by making some small suggestions. That is my function. As yours is vengeance.'"" 'Yes.'"" 'You are here about the death of the Angel Carasel?'"" 'Yes.'"" 'I did not kill him.'"" 'When he said it, I knew it was true."" 'Do you know who did?'"" 'That is your function, is it not? To discover who killed the poor thing and to take the Vengeance of the Name upon him.'"" 'Yes.'""He nodded."" 'What do you want to know?'""I paused, reflecting on what I had heard that day. 'Do you know what Lucifer was doing in that part of the City before the body was found?'""The old angel stared at me. 'I can hazard a guess.'"" 'Yes?'"" 'He was walking in the Dark.'""I nodded. I had a shape in my mind now. Something I could almost grasp. I asked the last question:"" 'What can you tell me about Love?'""And he told me. And I thought I had it all.""I returned to the place where Carasel's body had been. The remains had been removed, the blood had been cleaned away, the stray feathers collected and disposed of. There was nothing on the silver sidewalk to indicate it had ever been there. But I knew where it had been.""I ascended on my wings, flew upward until I neared the top of the spire of the Hall of Being. There was a window there, and I entered.""Saraquael was working there, putting a wingless mannikin into a small box. On one side of the box was a representation of a small brown creature with eight legs. On the other was a representation of a white blossom."" 'Saraquael?'"" 'Hm? Oh, it's you. Hello. Look at this. If you were to die and to be, let us say, put into the earth in a box, which would you want laid on top of you-a spider, here, or a lily, here?'"" 'The lily, I suppose.''Yes, that's what I think, too. But why? I wish . . ."" He raised a hand to his chin, stared down at the two models, put first one on top of the box, then the other, experimentally. 'There's so much to do, Raguel. So much to get right. And we only get one chance at it, you know. There'll just be one universe-we can't keep trying until we get it right. I wish I understood why all this was so important to Him . . .'"" 'Do you know where Zephkiel's cell is?' I asked him."" 'Yes. I mean, I've never been there. But I know where it is.''Good. Go there. He'll be expecting you. I will meet you there.'""He shook his head. ' I have work to do. I can't just . . .'""I felt my function come upon me. I looked down at him, and I said, 'You will be there. Go now.'""He said nothing. He backed away from me toward the window, staring at me; then he turned and flapped his wings, and I was alone.""I walked to the central well of the Hall and let myself fall, tumbling down through the model of the universe: it glittered around me, unfamiliar colors and shapes seething and writhing without meaning.""As I approached the bottom, I beat my wings, slowing my descent, and stepped lightly onto the silver floor. Phanuel stood between two angels who were both trying to claim his attention."" 'I don't care how aesthetically pleasing it would be,' he was explaining to one of them. 'We simply cannot put it in the center. Background radiation would prevent any possible life-forms from even getting a foothold; and anyway, it's too unstable.'""He turned to the other. 'Okay, let's see it. Hmm. So that's Green, is it? It's not exactly how I'd imagined it, but. Mm. Leave it with me. I'll get back to you.' He took a paper from the angel, folded it over decisively.""He turned to me. His manner was brusque, and dismissive.'Yes?'"" 'I need to talk to you.'"" 'Mm? Well, make it quick. I have much to do. If this is about Carasel's death, I have told you all I know.'"" 'It is about Carasel's death. But I will not speak to you now. Not here. Go to Zephkiel's cell: he is expecting you. I will meet you there.'""He seemed about to say something, but he only nodded, walked toward the door.""I turned to go when something occurred to me. I stopped the angel who had the Green. 'Tell me something.'"" 'If I can, sir.'"" 'That thing.' I pointed to the universe. 'What's it going to be for?'"" 'For? Why, it is the universe.'"" 'I know what it's called. But what purpose will it serve?'""He frowned. 'It is part of the plan. The Name wishes it; He requires such and such, to these dimensions and having such and such properties and ingredients. It is our function to bring it into existence, according to His wishes. I am sure He knows its function, but He has not revealed it to me.' His tone was one of gentle rebuke.""I nodded, and left that place.""High above the City a phalanx of angels wheeled and circled and dove. Each held a flaming sword that trailed a streak of burning brightness behind it, dazzling the eye. They moved in unison through the salmon pink sky. They were very beautiful. It was-you know on summer evenings when you get whole flocks of birds performing their dances in the sky? Weaving and circling and clustering and breaking apart again, so just as you think you understand the pattern, you realize you don't, and you never will? It was like that, only better.""Above me was the sky. Below me, the shining City. My home. And outside the City, the Dark.""Lucifer hovered a little below the Host, watching their maneuvers."" 'Lucifer?'"" 'Yes, Raguel? Have you discovered your malefactor?'"" 'I think so. Will you accompany me to Zephkiel's cell? There are others waiting for us there, and I will explain everything.'""He paused. Then, 'Certainly.'""He raised his perfect face to the angels, now performing a slow revolution in the sky, each moving through the air keeping perfect pace with the next, none of them ever touching. 'Azazel!'""An angel broke from the circle; the others adjusted almost imperceptibly to his disappearance, filling the space, so you could no longer see where he had been."" 'I have to leave. You are in command, Azazel. Keep them drilling. They still have much to perfect.'"" 'Yes, sir.'""Azazel hovered where Lucifer had been, staring up at the flock of angels, and Lucifer and I descended toward the City."" 'He's my second-in-command,' said Lucifer. 'Bright. Enthusiastic. Azazel would follow you anywhere.'"" 'What are you training them for?'"" 'War.'"" 'With whom?'"" 'How do you mean?'"" 'Who are they going to fight? Who else is there?'""He looked at me; his eyes were clear, and honest. 'I do not know. But He has Named us to be His army. So we will be perfect. For Him. The Name is infallible and all-just and all-wise, Raguel. It cannot be otherwise, no matter what-' He broke off and looked away."" 'You were going to say?'"" 'It is of no importance.'"" 'Ah.'""We did not talk for the rest of the descent to Zephkiel's cell.""I looked at my watch; it was almost three. A chill breeze had begun to blow down the L.A. street, and I shivered. The man noticed, and he paused in his story. ""You okay?"" he asked.""I'm fine. Please carry on. I'm fascinated.""He nodded.""They were waiting for us in Zephkiel's cell: Phanuel, Saraquael, and Zephkiel. Zephkiel was sitting in his chair. Lucifer took up a position beside the window.""I walked to center of the room, and I began."" 'I thank you all for coming here. You know who I am; you know my function. I am the Vengeance of the Name, the arm of the Lord. I am Raguel.""The Angel Carasel is dead. It was given to me to find out why he died, who killed him. This I have done. Now, the Angel Carasel was a designer in the Hall of Being. He was very good, or so I am told . . ."" 'Lucifer. Tell me what you were doing before you came upon Phanuel, and the body.'"" 'I have told you already. I was walking.'"" 'Where were you walking?'"" 'I do not see what business that is of yours.'"" 'Tell me.'""He paused. He was taller than any of us, tall, and proud. 'Very well. I was walking in the Dark. I have been walking in the Darkness for some time now. It helps me to gain a perspective on the City-being outside it. I see how fair it is, how perfect. There is nothing more enchanting than our home. Nothing more complete. Nowhere else that anyone would want to be.'"" 'And what do you do in the Dark, Lucifer?'""He stared at me. 'I walk. And . . . There are voices in the Dark. I listen to the voices. They promise me things, ask me questions, whisper and plead. And I ignore them. I steel myself and I gaze at the City. It is the only way I have of testing myself-putting myself to any kind of trial. I am the Captain of the Host; I am the first among the Angels, and I must prove myself.'""I nodded. 'Why did you not tell me this before?'""He looked down. 'Because I am the only angel who walks in the Dark. Because I do not want others to walk in the Dark: I am strong enough to challenge the voices, to test myself. Others are not so strong. Others might stumble, or fall.'"" 'Thank you, Lucifer. That is all, for now.' I turned to the next angel. 'Phanuel. How long have you been taking credit for Carasel's work?'""His mouth opened, but no sound came out."" 'I . . . I would not take credit for another's work.''But you did take credit for Love?'""He blinked. 'Yes. I did.'"" 'Would you care to explain to us all what Love is?' I asked.""He glanced around uncomfortably. 'It's a feeling of deep affection and attraction for another being, often combined with passion or desire-a need to be with another.' He spoke dryly, didactically, as if he were reciting a mathematical formula. 'The feeling that we have for the Name, for our Creator-that is Love amongst other things. Love will be an impulse that will inspire and ruin in equal measure. We are . . .' He paused, then began once more. 'We are very proud of it.'""He was mouthing the words. He no longer seemed to hold any hope that we would believe them."" 'Who did the majority of the work on Love? No, don't answer. Let me ask the others first. Zephkiel? When Phanuel passed the details on Love to you for approval, who did he tell you was responsible for it?'""The wingless angel smiled gently. 'He told me it was his project.'"" 'Thank you, sir. Now, Saraquael: whose was Love?'"" 'Mine. Mine and Carasel's. Perhaps more his than mine, but we worked on it together.'"" 'You knew that Phanuel was claiming the credit for it?'"" '. . . Yes.'"" 'And you permitted this?'"" 'He . . . he promised us that he would give us a good project of our own to follow. He promised that if we said nothing we would be given more big projects-and he was true to his word. He gave us Death.'""I turned back to Phanuel. 'Well?'"" 'It is true that I claimed that Love was mine.'"" 'But it was Carasel's. And Saraquael's.'"" 'Yes.'"" 'Their last project-before Death?'"" 'Yes.'"" 'That is all.'""I walked over to the window, looked at the silver spires, looked at the Dark. And I began to speak."" 'Carasel was a remarkable designer. If he had one failing, it was that he threw himself too deeply into his work.' I turned back to them. The Angel Saraquael was shivering, and lights were flickering beneath his skin. 'Saraquael? Who did Carasel love? Who was his lover?'""He stared at the floor. Then he stared up, proudly, aggressively. And he smiled."" 'I was.'"" 'Do you want to tell me about it?"""" 'No.' A shrug. 'But I suppose I must. Very well, then."" 'We worked together. And when we began to work on Love . . . we became lovers. It was his idea. We would go back to his cell whenever we could snatch the time. There we touched each other, held each other, whispered endearments and protestations of eternal devotion. His welfare mattered more to me than my own. I existed for him. When I was alone, I would repeat his name to myself and think of nothing but him.'"" 'When I was with him . . .' he paused. He looked down. 'Nothing else mattered.'""I walked to where Saraquael stood, lifted his chin with my hand, stared into his gray eyes. 'Then why did you kill him?'"" 'Because he would no longer love me. When we started to work on Death, he . . . he lost interest. He was no longer mine. He belonged to Death. And if I could not have him, then his new lover was welcome to him. I could not bear his presence-I could not endure to have him near me and to know that he felt nothing for me. That was what hurt the most. I thought . . . I hoped . . . that if he was gone, then I would no longer care for him-that the pain would stop."" 'So I killed him. I stabbed him, and I threw his body from our window in the Hall of Being. But the pain has not stopped.' It was almost a wail.""Saraquael reached up, removed my hand from his chin. 'Now what?'""I felt my aspect begin to come upon me; felt my function possess me. I was no longer an individual-I was the Vengeance of the Lord.""I moved close to Saraquael and embraced him. I pressed my lips to his, forced my tongue into his mouth. We kissed. He closed his eyes.""I felt it well up within me then: a burning, a brightness. From the corner of my eyes, I could see Lucifer and Phanuel averting their faces from my light; I could feel Zephkiel's stare. And my light became brighter and brighter until it erupted-from my eyes, from my chest, from my fingers, from my lips: a white searing fire.""The white flames consumed Saraquael slowly, and he clung to me as he burned.""Soon there was nothing left of him. Nothing at all.""I felt the flame leave me. I returned to myself once more.""Phanuel was sobbing. Lucifer was pale. Zephkiel sat in his chair, quietly watching me.""I turned to Phanuel and Lucifer. 'You have seen the Vengeance of the Lord,' I told them. 'Let it act as a warning to you both.'""Phanuel nodded. 'It has. Oh, it has. I . . . I will be on my way, sir. I will return to my appointed post. If that is all right with you?'"" 'Go.'""He stumbled to the window and plunged into the light, his wings beating furiously.""Lucifer walked over to the place on the silver floor where Saraquael had once stood. He knelt, stared desperately at the floor as if he were trying to find some remnant of the angel I had destroyed, a fragment of ash, or bone, or charred feather, but there was nothing to find. Then he looked up at me."" 'That was not right,' he said. 'That was not just.' He was crying; wet tears ran down his face. Perhaps Saraquael was the first to love, but Lucifer was the first to shed tears. I will never forget that.""I stared at him impassively. 'It was justice. He killed another. He was killed in his turn. You called me to my function, and I performed it."" 'But . . . he loved. He should have been forgiven. He should have been helped. He should not have been destroyed like that. That was wrong.'"" 'It was His will.'""Lucifer stood. 'Then perhaps His will is unjust. Perhaps the voices in the Darkness speak truly, after all. How can this be right?'"" 'It is right. It is His will. I merely performed my function.'""He wiped away the tears with the back of his hand. 'No,' he said, flatly. He shook his head, slowly, from side to side. Then he said, 'I must think on this. I will go now.'""He walked to the window, stepped into the sky, and he was gone.""Zephkiel and I were alone in his cell. I went over to his chair.He nodded at me. 'You have performed your function well, Raguel. Shouldn't you return to your cell to wait until you are next needed?' "" The man on the bench turned toward me: his eyes sought mine. Until now it had seemed-for most of his narrative-that he was scarcely aware of me; he had stared ahead of himself, whispered his tale in little better than a monotone. Now it felt as if he had discovered me and that he spoke to me alone, rather than to the air, or the City of Los Angeles. And he said:""I knew that he was right. But I couldn't have left then-not even if I had wanted to. My aspect had not entirely left me; my function was not completely fulfilled. And then it fell into place; I saw the whole picture. And like Lucifer, I knelt. I touched my forehead to the silver floor. 'No, Lord,' I said. 'Not yet.'""Zephkiel rose from his chair. 'Get up. It is not fitting for one angel to act in this way to another. It is not right. Get up!""""I shook my head. 'Father, You are no angel,' I whispered.""Zephkiel said nothing. For a moment, my heart misgave within me. I was afraid. 'Father, I was charged to discover who was responsible for Carasel's death. And I do know.'"" 'You have taken your Vengeance, Raguel.'"" 'Your Vengeance, Lord.'""And then He sighed and sat down once more. 'Ah, little Raguel. The problem with creating things is that they perform so much better than one had ever planned. Shall I ask how you recognized me?'"" 'I . . . I am not certain, Lord. You have no wings. You wait at the center of the City, supervising the Creation directly. When I destroyed Saraquael, You did not look away. You know too many things. You . . .' I paused and thought. 'No, I do not know how I know. As You say, You have created me well. But I only understood who You were, and the meaning of the drama we had enacted here for You, when I saw Lucifer leave.'"" 'What did you understand, child?'"" 'Who killed Carasel. Or, at least, who was pulling the strings. For example, who arranged for Carasel and Saraquael to work together on Love, knowing Carasel's tendency to involve himself too deeply in his work?'""He was speaking to me gently, almost teasingly, as an adult would pretend to make conversation with a tiny child. 'Why should anyone have ""pulled the strings,"" Raguel?'"" 'Because nothing occurs without reason; and all the reasons are Yours. You set Saraquael up: yes, he killed Carasel. But he killed Carasel so that I could destroy him.'"" 'And were you wrong to destroy him?'""I looked into His old, old eyes. 'It was my function. But I do not think it was just. I think perhaps it was needed that I destroy Saraquael, in order to demonstrate to Lucifer the Injustice of the Lord.'""He smiled, then. 'And whatever reason would I have for doing that?'"" 'I . . . I do not know. I do not understand-no more than I understand why You created the Dark or the voices in the Darkness. But You did. You caused all this to occur.'""He nodded. 'Yes. I did. Lucifer must brood on the unfairness of Saraquael's destruction. And that-amongst other things-will precipitate him into certain actions. Poor sweet Lucifer. His way will be the hardest of all my children; for there is a part he must play in the drama that is to come, and it is a grand role.'""I remained kneeling in front of the Creator of All Things.""What will you do now, Raguel?' He asked me."" 'I must return to my cell. My function is now fulfilled. I have taken Vengeance, and I have revealed the perpetrator. That is enough. But-Lord?'"" 'Yes, child.'"" 'I feel dirty. I feel tarnished. I feel befouled. Perhaps it is true that all that happens is in accordance with Your will, and thus it is good. But sometimes You leave blood on Your instruments.'""He nodded, as if He agreed with me. 'If you wish, Raguel, you may forget all this. All that has happened this day.' And then He said, 'However, you will not be able to speak of this to any other angel, whether you choose to remember it or not.'"" 'I will remember it.'"" 'It is your choice. But sometimes you will find it is easier by far not to remember. Forgetfulness can sometimes bring freedom, of a sort. Now, if you do not mind,' He reached down, took a file from a stack on the floor, opened it, 'there is work I should be getting on with.'""I stood up and walked to the window. I hoped He would call me back, explain every detail of His plan to me, somehow make it all better. But He said nothing, and I left His Presence without ever looking back.""The man was silent, then. And he remained silent-I couldn't even hear him breathing-for so long that I began to get nervous, thinking that perhaps he had fallen asleep or died.Then he stood up.""There you go, pal. That's your story. Do you think it was worth a couple of cigarettes and a book of matches?"" He asked the question as if it was important to him, without irony.""Yes,"" I told him. ""Yes. It was. But what happened next? How did you . . . I mean, if . . . "" I trailed off.It was dark on the street now, at the edge of daybreak. One by one the streetlamps had begun to flicker out, and he was silhouetted against the glow of the dawn sky. He thrust his hands into his pockets. ""What happened? I left home, and I lost my way, and these days home's a long way back. Sometimes you do things you regret, but there's nothing you can do about them. Times change. Doors close behind you. You move on. You know?""Eventually I wound up here. They used to say no one's ever originally from L.A. True as Hell in my case.""And then, before I could understand what he was doing, he leaned down and kissed me, gently, on the cheek. His stubble was rough and prickly, but his breath was surprisingly sweet. He whispered into my ear: ""I never fell. I don't care what they say. I'm still doing my job, as I see it.""My cheek burned where his lips had touched it.He straightened up. ""But I still want to go home.""The man walked away down the darkened street, and I sat on the bench and watched him go. I felt like he had taken something from me, although I could no longer remember what. And I felt like something had been left in its place-absolution, perhaps, or innocence, although of what, or from what, I could no longer say.An image from somewhere: a scribbled drawing of two angels in flight above a perfect city; and over the image a child's perfect hand print, which stains the white paper blood-red. It came into my head unbidden, and I no longer know what it meant.I stood up.It was too dark to see the face of my watch, but I knew I would get no sleep that day. I walked back to the place I was staying, to the house by the stunted palm tree, to wash myself and to wait. I thought about angels and about Tink; and I wondered whether love and death went hand in hand.The next day the planes to England were flying again.I felt strange-lack of sleep had forced me into that miserable state in which everything seems flat and of equal importance; when nothing matters, and in which reality seems scraped thin and threadbare. The taxi journey to the airport was a nightmare. I was hot, and tired, and testy. I wore a T-shirt in the L.A. heat; my coat was packed at the bottom of my luggage, where it had been for the entire stay.The airplane was crowded, but I didn't care.The stewardess walked down the aisle with a rack of newspapers: the Herald Tribune, USA Today, and the L.A.Times. I took a copy of the Times, but the words left my head as my eyes scanned over them. Nothing that I read remained with me. No, I lie. Somewhere in the back of the paper was a report of a triple murder: two women and a small child. No names were given, and I do not know why the report should have registered as it did.Soon I fell asleep. I dreamed about fucking Tink, while blood ran sluggishly from her closed eyes and lips. The blood was cold and viscous and clammy, and I awoke chilled by the plane's air-conditioning, with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. My tongue and lips were dry. I looked out of the scratched oval window, stared down at the clouds, and it occurred to me then (not for the first time) that the clouds were in actuality another land, where everyone knew just what they were looking for and how to get back where they started from.Staring down at the clouds is one of the things I have always liked best about flying. That, and the proximity one feels to one's death.I wrapped myself in the thin aircraft blanket and slept some more, but if further dreams came then they made no impression upon me.A blizzard blew up shortly after the plane landed in England, knocking out the airport's power supply. I was alone in an airport elevator at the time, and it went dark and jammed between floors. A dim emergency light flickered on. I pressed the crimson alarm button until the batteries ran down and it ceased to sound; then I shivered in my L.A. T-shirt in the corner of my little silver room. I watched my breath steam in the air, and I hugged myself for warmth.There wasn't anything in there except me; but even so, I felt safe and secure. Soon someone would come and force open the doors. Eventually somebody would let me out; and I knew that I would soon be home.

I do not know what manner of thing she is. None of us do. She killed her mother in the birthing, but that's never enough to account for it.They call me wise, but I am far from wise, for all that I foresaw fragments of it, frozen moments caught in pools of water or in the cold glass of my mirror. If I were wise I would not have tried to change what I saw. If I were wise I would have killed myself before ever I encountered her, before ever I caught him.Wise, and a witch, or so they said, and I'd seen his face in my dreams and in reflections for all my life: sixteen years of dreaming of him before he reined his horse by the bridge that morning and asked my name. He helped me onto his high horse and we rode together to my little cottage, my face buried in the gold of his hair. He asked for the best of what I had; a king's right, it was.His beard was red-bronze in the morning light, and I knew him, not as a king, for I knew nothing of kings then, but as my love. He took all he wanted from me, the right of kings, but he returned to me on the following day and on the night after that: his beard so red, his hair so gold, his eyes the blue of a summer sky, his skin tanned the gentle brown of ripe wheat.His daughter was only a child: no more than five years of age when I came to the palace. A portrait of her dead mother hung in the princess's tower room: a tall woman, hair the color of dark wood, eyes nut-brown. She was of a different blood to her pale daughter.The girl would not eat with us.I do not know where in the palace she ate.I had my own chambers. My husband the king, he had his own rooms also. When he wanted me he would send for me, and I would go to him, and pleasure him, and take my pleasure with him.One night, several months after I was brought to the palace, she came to my rooms. She was six. I was embroidering by lamplight, squinting my eyes against the lamp's smoke and fitful illumination. When I looked up, she was there.""Princess?""She said nothing. Her eyes were black as coal, black as her hair; her lips were redder than blood. She looked up at me and smiled. Her teeth seemed sharp, even then, in the lamplight.""What are you doing away from your room?""""I'm hungry,"" she said, like any child.It was winter, when fresh food is a dream of warmth and sunlight; but I had strings of whole apples, cored and dried, hanging from the beams of my chamber, and I pulled an apple down for her.""Here.""Autumn is the time of drying, of preserving, a time of picking apples, of rendering the goose fat. Winter is the time of hunger, of snow, and of death; and it is the time of the midwinter feast, when we rub the goose fat into the skin of a whole pig, stuffed with that autumn's apples; then we roast it or spit it, and we prepare to feast upon the crackling.She took the dried apple from me and began to chew it with her sharp yellow teeth.""Is it good?""She nodded. I had always been scared of the little princess, but at that moment I warmed to her and, with my fingers, gently, I stroked her cheek. She looked at me and smiled-she smiled but rarely-then she sank her teeth into the base of my thumb, the Mound of Venus, and she drew blood.I began to shriek, from pain and from surprise, but she looked at me and I fell silent.The little princess fastened her mouth to my hand and licked and sucked and drank. When she was finished, she left my chamber. Beneath my gaze the cut that she had made began to close, to scab, and to heal. The next day it was an old scar: I might have cut my hand with a pocketknife in my childhood.I had been frozen by her, owned and dominated. That scared me, more than the blood she had fed on. After that night I locked my chamber door at dusk, barring it with an oaken pole, and I had the smith forge iron bars, which he placed across my windows.My husband, my love, my king, sent for me less and less, and when I came to him he was dizzy, listless, confused. He could no longer make love as a man makes love, and he would not permit me to pleasure him with my mouth: the one time I tried, he started violently, and began to weep. I pulled my mouth away and held him tightly until the sobbing had stopped, and he slept, like a child.I ran my fingers across his skin as he slept. It was covered in a multitude of ancient scars. But I could recall no scars from the days of our courtship, save one, on his side, where a boar had gored him when he was a youth.Soon he was a shadow of the man I had met and loved by the bridge. His bones showed, blue and white, beneath his skin. I was with him at the last: his hands were cold as stone, his eyes milky blue, his hair and beard faded and lustreless and limp. He died unshriven, his skin nipped and pocked from head to toe with tiny, old scars.He weighed near to nothing. The ground was frozen hard, and we could dig no grave for him, so we made a cairn of rocks and stones above his body, as a memorial only, for there was little enough of him left to protect from the hunger of the beasts and the birds.So I was queen.And I was foolish, and young-eighteen summers had come and gone since first I saw daylight-and I did not do what I would do, now.If it were today, I would have her heart cut out, true. But then I would have her head and arms and legs cut off. I would have them disembowel her. And then I would watch in the town square as the hangman heated the fire to white-heat with bellows, watch unblinking as he consigned each part of her to the fire. I would have archers around the square, who would shoot any bird or animal that came close to the flames, any raven or dog or hawk or rat. And I would not close my eyes until the princess was ash, and a gentle wind could scatter her like snow.I did not do this thing, and we pay for our mistakes.They say I was fooled; that it was not her heart. That it was the heart of an animal-a stag, perhaps, or a boar. They say that, and they are wrong.And some say (but it is her lie, not mine) that I was given the heart, and that I ate it. Lies and half-truths fall like snow, covering the things that I remember, the things I saw. A landscape, unrecognizable after a snowfall; that is what she has made of my life.There were scars on my love, her father's thighs, and on his ballock-pouch, and on his male member, when he died.I did not go with them. They took her in the day, while she slept, and was at her weakest. They took her to the heart of the forest, and there they opened her blouse, and they cut out her heart, and they left her dead, in a gully, for the forest to swallow.The forest is a dark place, the border to many kingdoms; no one would be foolish enough to claim jurisdiction over it. Outlaws live in the forest. Robbers live in the forest, and so do wolves. You can ride through the forest for a dozen days and never see a soul; but there are eyes upon you the entire time.They brought me her heart. I know it was hers-no sow's heart or doe's would have continued to beat and pulse after it had been cut out, as that one did.I took it to my chamber.I did not eat it: I hung it from the beams above my bed, placed it on a length of twine that I strung with rowan berries, orangered as a robin's breast, and with bulbs of garlic.Outside the snow fell, covering the footprints of my huntsmen, covering her tiny body in the forest where it lay.I had the smith remove the iron bars from my windows, and I would spend some time in my room each afternoon through the short winter days, gazing out over the forest, until darkness fell.There were, as I have already stated, people in the forest. They would come out, some of them, for the Spring Fair: a greedy, feral, dangerous people; some were stunted-dwarfs and midgets and hunchbacks; others had the huge teeth and vacant gazes of idiots; some had fingers like flippers or crab claws. They would creep out of the forest each year for the Spring Fair, held when the snows had melted.As a young lass I had worked at the fair, and they had scared me then, the forest folk. I told fortunes for the fairgoers, scrying in a pool of still water; and later, when I was older, in a disk of polished glass, its back all silvered-a gift from a merchant whose straying horse I had seen in a pool of ink.The stallholders at the fair were afraid of the forest folk; they would nail their wares to the bare boards of their stalls-slabs of gingerbread or leather belts were nailed with great iron nails to the wood. If their wares were not nailed, they said, the forest folk would take them and run away, chewing on the stolen gingerbread, flailing about them with the belts.The forest folk had money, though: a coin here, another there, sometimes stained green by time or the earth, the face on the coin unknown to even the oldest of us. Also they had things to trade, and thus the fair continued, serving the outcasts and the dwarfs, serving the robbers (if they were circumspect) who preyed on the rare travelers from lands beyond the forest, or on gypsies, or on the deer. (This was robbery in the eyes of the law. The deer were the queen's.)The years passed by slowly, and my people claimed that I ruled them with wisdom. The heart still hung above my bed, pulsing gently in the night. If there were any who mourned the child, I saw no evidence: she was a thing of terror, back then, and they believed themselves well rid of her.Spring Fair followed Spring Fair: five of them, each sadder, poorer, shoddier than the one before. Fewer of the forest folk came out of the forest to buy. Those who did seemed subdued and listless. The stallholders stopped nailing their wares to the boards of their stalls. And by the fifth year but a handful of folk came from the forest-a fearful huddle of little hairy men, and no one else.The Lord of the Fair, and his page, came to me when the fair was done. I had known him slightly, before I was queen.""I do not come to you as my queen,"" he said.I said nothing. I listened.""I come to you because you are wise,"" he continued. ""When you were a child you found a strayed foal by staring into a pool of ink; when you were a maiden you found a lost infant who had wandered far from her mother, by staring into that mirror of yours. You know secrets and you can seek out things hidden. My queen,"" he asked, ""what is taking the forest folk? Next year there will be no Spring Fair. The travelers from other kingdoms have grown scarce and few, the folk of the forest are almost gone. Another year like the last, and we shall all starve.""I commanded my maidservant to bring me my looking glass. It was a simple thing, a silver-backed glass disk, which I kept wrapped in a doeskin, in a chest, in my chamber.They brought it to me then, and I gazed into it:She was twelve and she was no longer a little child. Her skin was still pale, her eyes and hair coal-black, her lips blood-red. She wore the clothes she had worn when she left the castle for the last time-the blouse, the skirt-although they were much let-out, much mended. Over them she wore a leather cloak, and instead of boots she had leather bags, tied with thongs, over her tiny feet.She was standing in the forest, beside a tree.As I watched, in the eye of my mind, I saw her edge and step and flitter and pad from tree to tree, like an animal: a bat or a wolf. She was following someone.He was a monk. He wore sackcloth, and his feet were bare and scabbed and hard. His beard and tonsure were of a length, overgrown, unshaven.She watched him from behind the trees. Eventually he paused for the night and began to make a fire, laying twigs down, breaking up a robin's nest as kindling. He had a tinderbox in his robe, and he knocked the flint against the steel until the sparks caught the tinder and the fire flamed. There had been two eggs in the nest he had found, and these he ate raw. They cannot have been much of a meal for so big a man.He sat there in the firelight, and she came out from her hiding place. She crouched down on the other side of the fire, and stared at him. He grinned, as if it were a long time since he had seen another human, and beckoned her over to him.She stood up and walked around the fire, and waited, an arm's length away. He pulled in his robe until he found a coin-a tiny copper penny-and tossed it to her. She caught it, and nodded, and went to him. He pulled at the rope around his waist, and his robe swung open. His body was as hairy as a bear's. She pushed him back onto the moss. One hand crept, spiderlike, through the tangle of hair, until it closed on his manhood; the other hand traced a circle on his left nipple. He closed his eyes and fumbled one huge hand under her skirt. She lowered her mouth to the nipple she had been teasing, her smooth skin white on the furry brown body of him.She sank her teeth deep into his breast. His eyes opened, then they closed again, and she drank.She straddled him, and she fed. As she did so, a thin blackish liquid began to dribble from between her legs . . .""Do you know what is keeping the travelers from our town? What is happening to the forest people?"" asked the Lord of the Fair.I covered the mirror in doeskin, and told him that I would personally take it upon myself to make the forest safe once more.I had to, although she terrified me. I was the queen.A foolish woman would have gone then into the forest and tried to capture the creature; but I had been foolish once and had no wish to be so a second time.I spent time with old books. I spent time with the gypsy women (who passed through our country across the mountains to the south, rather than cross the forest to the north and the west).I prepared myself and obtained those things I would need, and when the first snows began to fall, I was ready.Naked, I was, and alone in the highest tower of the palace, a place open to the sky. The winds chilled my body; goose pimples crept across my arms and thighs and breasts. I carried a silver basin, and a basket in which I had placed a silver knife, a silver pin, some tongs, a gray robe, and three green apples.I put them on and stood there, unclothed, on the tower, humble before the night sky and the wind. Had any man seen me standing there, I would have had his eyes; but there was no one to spy. Clouds scudded across the sky, hiding and uncovering the waning moon.I took the silver knife and slashed my left arm-once, twice, three times. The blood dripped into the basin, scarlet seeming black in the moonlight.I added the powder from the vial that hung around my neck. It was a brown dust, made of dried herbs and the skin of a particular toad, and from certain other things. It thickened the blood, while preventing it from clotting.I took the three apples, one by one, and pricked their skins gently with my silver pin. Then I placed the apples in the silver bowl and let them sit there while the first tiny flakes of snow of the year fell slowly onto my skin, and onto the apples, and onto the blood.When dawn began to brighten the sky I covered myself with the gray cloak, and took the red apples from the silver bowl, one by one, lifting each into my basket with silver tongs, taking care not to touch it. There was nothing left of my blood or of the brown powder in the silver bowl, nothing save a black residue, like a verdigris, on the inside.I buried the bowl in the earth. Then I cast a glamour on the apples (as once, years before, by a bridge, I had cast a glamour on myself), that they were, beyond any doubt, the most wonderful apples in the world, and the crimson blush of their skins was the warm color of fresh blood.I pulled the hood of my cloak low over my face, and I took ribbons and pretty hair ornaments with me, placed them above the apples in the reed basket, and I walked alone into the forest until I came to her dwelling: a high sandstone cliff, laced with deep caves going back a way into the rock wall.There were trees and boulders around the cliff face, and I walked quietly and gently from tree to tree without disturbing a twig or a fallen leaf. Eventually I found my place to hide, and I waited, and I watched.After some hours, a clutch of dwarfs crawled out of the hole in the cave front-ugly, misshapen, hairy little men, the old inhabitants of this country. You saw them seldom now.They vanished into the wood, and none of them espied me, though one of them stopped to piss against the rock I hid behind.I waited. No more came out.I went to the cave entrance and hallooed into it, in a cracked old voice.The scar on my Mound of Venus throbbed and pulsed as she came toward me, out of the darkness, naked and alone.She was thirteen years of age, my stepdaughter, and nothing marred the perfect whiteness of her skin, save for the livid scar on her left breast, where her heart had been cut from her long since.The insides of her thighs were stained with wet black filth.She peered at me, hidden, as I was, in my cloak. She looked at me hungrily. ""Ribbons, goodwife,"" I croaked. ""Pretty ribbons for your hair . . . ""She smiled and beckoned to me. A tug; the scar on my hand was pulling me toward her. I did what I had planned to do, but I did it more readily than I had planned: I dropped my basket and screeched like the bloodless old peddler woman I was pretending to be, and I ran.My gray cloak was the color of the forest, and I was fast; she did not catch me.I made my way back to the palace.I did not see it. Let us imagine, though, the girl returning, frustrated and hungry, to her cave, and finding my fallen basket on the ground.What did she do?I like to think she played first with the ribbons, twined them into her raven hair, looped them around her pale neck or her tiny waist.And then, curious, she moved the cloth to see what else was in the basket, and she saw the red, red apples.They smelled like fresh apples, of course; and they also smelled of blood. And she was hungry. I imagine her picking up an apple, pressing it against her cheek, feeling the cold smoothness of it against her skin.And she opened her mouth and bit deep into it . . .By the time I reached my chambers, the heart that hung from the roof beam, with the apples and hams and the dried sausages, had ceased to beat. It hung there, quietly, without motion or life, and I felt safe once more.That winter the snows were high and deep, and were late melting. We were all hungry come the spring.The Spring Fair was slightly improved that year. The forest folk were few, but they were there, and there were travelers from the lands beyond the forest.I saw the little hairy men of the forest cave buying and bargaining for pieces of glass, and lumps of crystal and of quartz rock. They paid for the glass with silver coins-the spoils of my stepdaughter's depredations, I had no doubt. When it got about what they were buying, townsfolk rushed back to their homes and came back with their lucky crystals, and, in a few cases, with whole sheets of glass.I thought briefly about having the little men killed, but I did not. As long as the heart hung, silent and immobile and cold, from the beam of my chamber, I was safe, and so were the folk of the forest, and, thus, eventually, the folk of the town.My twenty-fifth year came, and my stepdaughter had eaten the poisoned fruit two winters back, when the prince came to my palace. He was tall, very tall, with cold green eyes and the swarthy skin of those from beyond the mountains.He rode with a small retinue: large enough to defend him, small enough that another monarch-myself, for instance-would not view him as a potential threat.I was practical: I thought of the alliance of our lands, thought of the kingdom running from the forests all the way south to the sea; I thought of my golden-haired bearded love, dead these eight years; and, in the night, I went to the prince's room.I am no innocent, although my late husband, who was once my king, was truly my first lover, no matter what they say.At first the prince seemed excited. He bade me remove my shift, and made me stand in front of the opened window, far from the fire, until my skin was chilled stone-cold. Then he asked me to lie upon my back, with my hands folded across my breasts, my eyes wide open-but staring only at the beams above. He told me not to move, and to breathe as little as possible. He implored me to say nothing. He spread my legs apart.It was then that he entered me.As he began to thrust inside me, I felt my hips raise, felt myself begin to match him, grind for grind, push for push. I moaned. I could not help myself.His manhood slid out of me. I reached out and touched it, a tiny, slippery thing.""Please,"" he said softly. ""You must neither move nor speak. Just lie there on the stones, so cold and so fair.""I tried, but he had lost whatever force it was that had made him virile; and, some short while later, I left the prince's room, his curses and tears still resounding in my ears.He left early the next morning, with all his men, and they rode off into the forest.I imagine his loins, now, as he rode, a knot of frustration at the base of his manhood. I imagine his pale lips pressed so tightly together. Then I imagine his little troupe riding through the forest, finally coming upon the glass-and-crystal cairn of my stepdaughter. So pale. So cold. Naked beneath the glass, and little more than a girl, and dead.In my fancy, I can almost feel the sudden hardness of his manhood inside his britches, envision the lust that took him then, the prayers he muttered beneath his breath in thanks for his good fortune. I imagine him negotiating with the little hairy men-offering them gold and spices for the lovely corpse under the crystal mound.Did they take his gold willingly? Or did they look up to see his men on their horses, with their sharp swords and their spears, and realize they had no alternative?I do not know. I was not there; I was not scrying. I can only imagine . . .Hands, pulling off the lumps of glass and quartz from her cold body. Hands, gently caressing her cold cheek, moving her cold arm, rejoicing to find the corpse still fresh and pliable.Did he take her there, in front of them all? Or did he have her carried to a secluded nook before he mounted her?I cannot say.Did he shake the apple from her throat? Or did her eyes slowly open as he pounded into her cold body; did her mouth open, those red lips part, those sharp yellow teeth close on his swarthy neck, as the blood, which is the life, trickled down her throat, washing down and away the lump of apple, my own, my poison?I imagine; I do not know.This I do know: I was woken in the night by her heart pulsing and beating once more. Salt blood dripped onto my face from above. I sat up. My hand burned and pounded as if I had hit the base of my thumb with a rock.There was a hammering on the door. I felt afraid, but I am a queen, and I would not show fear. I opened the door.First his men walked into my chamber and stood around me, with their sharp swords, and their long spears.Then he came in; and he spat in my face.Finally, she walked into my chamber, as she had when I was first a queen and she was a child of six. She had not changed. Not really.She pulled down the twine on which her heart was hanging. She pulled off the rowan berries, one by one; pulled off the garlic bulb-now a dried thing, after all these years; then she took up her own, her pumping heart-a small thing, no larger than that of a nanny goat or a she-bear-as it brimmed and pumped its blood into her hand.Her fingernails must have been as sharp as glass: she opened her breast with them, running them over the purple scar. Her chest gaped, suddenly, open and bloodless. She licked her heart, once, as the blood ran over her hands, and she pushed the heart deep into her breast.I saw her do it. I saw her close the flesh of her breast once more. I saw the purple scar begin to fade.Her prince looked briefly concerned, but he put his arm around her nonetheless, and they stood, side by side, and they waited.And she stayed cold, and the bloom of death remained on her lips, and his lust was not diminished in any way.They told me they would marry, and the kingdoms would indeed be joined. They told me that I would be with them on their wedding day.It is starting to get hot in here.They have told the people bad things about me; a little truth to add savor to the dish, but mixed with many lies.I was bound and kept in a tiny stone cell beneath the palace, and I remained there through the autumn. Today they fetched me out of the cell; they stripped the rags from me, and washed the filth from me, and then they shaved my head and my loins, and they rubbed my skin with goose-grease.The snow was falling as they carried me-two men at each hand, two men at each leg-utterly exposed, and spread-eagled and cold, through the midwinter crowds, and brought me to this kiln.My stepdaughter stood there with her prince. She watched me, in my indignity, but she said nothing.As they thrust me inside, jeering and chaffing as they did so, I saw one snowflake land upon her white cheek, and remain there without melting.They closed the kiln door behind me. It is getting hotter in here, and outside they are singing and cheering and banging on the sides of the kiln.She was not laughing, or jeering, or talking. She did not sneer at me or turn away. She looked at me, though; and for a moment I saw myself reflected in her eyes.I will not scream. I will not give them that satisfaction. They will have my body, but my soul and my story are my own, and will die with me.The goose-grease begins to melt and glisten upon my skin. I shall make no sound at all. I shall think no more on this.I shall think instead of the snowflake on her cheek.I think of her hair as black as coal, her lips, redder than blood, her skin, snow-white.

SM_ch33	SM	Smoke and Mirrors	33	1849	10380	Fifteen Painted Cards from a Vampire Tarot0.THE FOOL""What do you want?""The young man had come to the graveyard every night for a month now. He had watched the moon paint the cold granite and the fresh marble and the old moss-covered stones and statues in its cold light. He had started at shadows and at owls. He had watched courting couples, and drunks, and teenagers taking nervous shortcuts: all the people who come through the graveyard at night.He slept in the day. Nobody cared. He stood alone in the night and shivered, in the cold. It came to him then that he was standing on the edge of a precipice.The voice came from the night all around him, in his head and out of it.""What do you want?"" it repeated.He wondered if he dared to turn and look, realised he did not.""Well? You come here every night, in a place where the living are not welcome. I have seen you. Why?""""I wanted to meet you,"" he said, without looking around. ""I want to live for ever."" His voice cracked as he said it.He had stepped over the precipice. There was no going back. In his imagination, he could already feel the prick of needle-sharp fangs in his neck, a sharp prelude to eternal life.The sound began. It was low and sad, like the rushing of an underground river. It took him several long seconds to recognise it as laughter.""This is not life,"" said the voice.It said nothing more, and after a while the young man knew he was alone in the graveyard.1.THE MAGICIANThey asked St. Germain's manservant if his master was truly a thousand years old, as it was rumoured he had claimed.""How would I know?"" the man replied. ""I have only been in the master's employ for three hundred years.""2.THE PRIESTESSHer skin was pale, and her eyes were dark, and her hair was dyed black. She went on a daytime talk show and proclaimed herself a vampire queen. She showed the cameras her dentally crafted fangs, and brought on ex-lovers who, in various stages of embarrassment, admitted that she had drawn their blood, and that she drank it.""You can be seen in a mirror, though?"" asked the talk show hostess. She was the richest woman in America, and had got that way by bringing the freaks and the hurt and the lost out in front of her cameras, and showing their pain to the world.The studio audience laughed.The woman seemed slightly affronted. ""Yes. Contrary to what people may think, vampires can be seen in mirrors and on television cameras.""""Well, that's one thing you finally got right, honey,"" said the hostess of the daytime talk show. But she put her hand over her microphone as she said it, and it was never broadcast.5.THE POPEThis is my body, he said, two thousand years ago. This is my blood.It was the only religion that delivered exactly what it promised: life eternal, for its adherentsThere are some of us alive today who remember him. And some of us claim that he was a messiah, and some think that he was just a man with very special powers. But that misses the point. Whatever he was, he changed the world.6.THE LOVERSAfter she was dead, she began to come him, in the night. He grew pale, and there were deep circles under his eyes. At first, they thought he was mourning her. And then, one night, he was gone.It was hard for them to get permission to disinter her, but they got it. They hauled up the coffin and they unscrewed it. Then they prized what they found out of the box. There was six inches of water in the bottom of the box: the iron had coloured it a deep, orangish red. There were two bodies in the coffin: hers, of course, and his. He was more decayed than she was. Later, someone wondered aloud how both of them had fitted in a coffin built for one. Especially given her condition, he said; for she was very obviously very pregnant.This caused some confusion, for she had not been noticeably pregnant when she was buried.Still later they dug her up for one last time, at the request of the church authorities, who had heard rumours of what had been found in the grave. Her stomach was flat. The local doctor told them all that it had just been gas and bloating as the stomach swelled. The townsfolk nodded, almost as if they believed him.7.THE CHARIOTIt was genetic engineering at its finest: they created a breed of human to sail the stars: they needed to be possessed of impossibly long life-spans, for the distances between the stars were vast; space was limited, and their food supplies needed to be compact; they needed to be able to process local sustenance, and to colonise the worlds they found with their own kind.The homeworld wished the colonists well, and sent them on their way. They removed all traces of their location from the ships' computers first, however. To be on the safe side.10.THE WHEEL OF FORTUNEWhat did you do with the doctor? she asked, and laughed. I thought the Doctor came in here ten minutes ago.I'm sorry, I said. I was hungry.And we both laughed.I'll go find her for you, she said.I sat in the doctor's office, picking my teeth. After a while the assistant came back.I'm sorry, she said. The doctor must have stepped out for a while. Can I make an appointment for you for next week?I shook my head. I'll call, I said. But, for the first time that day, I was not telling the truth.11.JUSTICE""It is not human,"" said the magistrate, ""and it does not deserve the trial of a human thing.""""Ah,"" said the advocate. ""But we cannot execute without a trial: there are the precedents. A pig, that had eaten a child who had fallen into its sty. It was found guilty and hanged. A swarm of bees, found guilty of stinging an old man to death, was burned by the public hangman. We owe the hellish creature no less.""The evidence against the baby was incontestable. It amounted to this: a woman had brought the baby from the country. She said it was hers, and that her husband was dead. She lodged at the house of a coach maker and his wife. The old coach maker complained of melancholia and lassitude, and was, with his wife and their lodger, found dead by their servant. The baby was alive in its cradle, pale and wide-eyed, and there was blood on its face and lips.The jury found the little thing guilty, beyond all doubt, and condemned it to death.The executioner was the town butcher. In the sight of all the town he cut the babe in two, and flung the pieces onto the fire.His own baby had died earlier that same week. Infant mortality in those days was a hard thing but common. The butcher's wife had been brokenhearted.She had already left the town, to see her sister in the city, and, within the week, the butcher joined her. The three of them - butcher, wife and babe - made the prettiest family you ever did see.14.TEMPERANCEShe said she was a vampire. One thing I knew already, the woman was a liar. You could see it in her eyes. Black as coals they were, but she never quite looked at you, staring at invisibles over your shoulder, behind you, above you, two inches in front of your face.""What does it taste like?"" I asked her. This was in the parking lot, behind the bar. She worked the graveyard shift in the bar, mixed the finest drinks, but never drank anything herself.""V8 juice,"" she said. ""Not the low-sodium kind, but the original. Or a salty gazpacho.""""What's gazpacho?""""A sort of vegetable soup.""""You're shitting me.""""No.""""So you drink blood? Just like I drink V8?""""Not exactly,"" she said. ""If you get sick of drinking V8 you can drink something else.""""Yeah,"" I said. ""Actually, I don't like V8 much.""""See?"" she said. ""In China it's not blood, they drink, it's spinal fluid.""""What's that taste like?""""Nothing much. Clear broth.""""You've tried it?""""I know people.""I tried to figure out if I could see her reflection in the wing mirror of the truck we were leaning against, but it was dark, and I couldn't tell.15.THE DEVILThis is his portrait. Look at his flat, yellow teeth, his ruddy face. He has horns, and he carries a foot-long wooden stake in one hand, and his wooden mallet in the other.Of course, there is no such thing as the devil.16.THE TOWER The tower's built of spit and spite,Without a sound, without a sight.The biter bit, the bitter bite.(It's better to be out at night.)17.THE STARThe older, richer, ones follow the winter, taking the long nights where they find them. Still, they prefer the northern hemisphere to the south.""You see that star?"" they say, pointing to one of the stars in the constellation of Draco, the Dragon. ""We came from there. One day we shall return.""The younger ones sneer and jeer and laugh at this. Still, as the years become centuries, they find themselves becoming homesick for a place they have never been; and they find the northern climes reassuring, as long as Draco twines about the greater and lesser Bears, up near chill Polaris.19.THE SUN""Imagine,"" she said, ""that there was something in the sky that was going to hurt you, perhaps even kill you. A huge eagle or something. Imagine that if you went out in daylight the eagle would get you.""""Well,"" she said. ""That's how it is for us. Only it's not a bird. It's bright, beautiful, dangerous daylight, and I haven't seen it now in a hundred years.""20.JUDGEMENTIt's a way of talking about lust without talking about lust, he told them.It is a way of talking about sex, and fear of sex, and death, and fear of death, and what else is there to talk about?21.THE WORLD""You know the saddest thing,"" she said. ""The saddest thing is that we're you.""I said nothing.""In your fantasies,"" she said, ""my people are just like you. Only better. We don't die, or age, or suffer from pain or cold or thirst. We're snappier dressers. We posses the wisdom of the ages. And if we crave blood, well, it is no more than the way you people crave food, or affection, or sunlight - and besides, it gets us out of the house. Crypt. Coffin. Whatever.""""And the truth is?"" I asked her.""We're you,"" she said. ""We're you, with all your fuckups and all the things that make you human - all your fears and lonelinesses and confusions . . . none of that gets better.""But we're colder than you are. Deader. I miss daylight and food and knowing how it feels to touch someone and care. I remember life, and meeting people as people and not just as things to feed on or control, and I remember what it was to feel something, anything, happy or sad or anything . . ."" And then she stopped.""Are you crying?"" I asked.""We don't cry,"" she told me. Like I said, the woman was a liar.

He wishes he were dead. A DREAM:As Webster tosses in his bedHe sees McBride, a corpse beneath a bridge,all INTERCUT with lots of shots of food,to make our theme explicit: this is art. EXT. LA. DAY.Webster's become obsessed.He has to find the woman from the screen.He beats somebody up, fucks someone else,fixated on ""I'll see you, Webster, soon"". He's thrown in prison. And they come for himThe man in black attending the brunette,Open his cell with keys, escort him out,and leave the prison building. Through a door.They walk him to the car park. They go down,below the car park, deep beneath the town,past shadowed writhing things that suck and hissand glossy things that laugh, and things that scream.Now other feeder-folk are walking past...They handcuff Webster to A TINY MANwho's covered with vaginas and with teeth,and escorts Webster to THE QUEEN'S SALON. (An interjection here: my wife awoke,scared by an evil dream. ""You hated me.You brought these women home I didn't know,but they knew me, and then we had a fight,and after we had shouted you stormed out.You said you'd find a girl to fuck and eat."" This scares me just a little. As we writewe summon little demons. So I shrug.) The handcuffs are removed. He's left alone.The hangings are red velvet, then they lift,reveal the Queen. We recognise her face,the woman we saw on the VCR.""The world divides so sweetly, neatly upinto the feeder-folk, into their prey.""That's what she says. Her voice is soft and sweet. Imagine honey-ants: the tiny head,the chest, the tiny arms, the tiny hands,and after that the bloat of honey-swell,the abdomen enormous as it hangstranslucent, made of honey, sweet as lust. The Queen has quite a perfect little face,her breasts are pale, blue-veined; her nipples pink;her hands are white. But then, below her breaststhe whole swells like a whale or like a shrine,a human honey-ant, she's huge as rooms,as elephants, as dinosaurs, as love.Her flesh is opalescent, and she callspoor Webster to her. And he nods and comes.(She must be over twenty-five feet long.)She orders him to take off all his clothes.His cock is hard. He shivers. He looks lost.He moans ""I'm harder than I've ever been"".Then, with her mouth, she licks and tongues his cock... We linger here. The language of the eyebecomes a bland, unflinching, blowjob porn,(her lips are glossy, and her tongue is red)HOLD on her face. We hear him gasping ""Oh.Oh baby. Yes. Oh. Take it in your mouth.""And then she opens up her mouth, and grins,and bites his cock off.Spurting blood pumps outinto her mouth. She hardly spills a drop.We never do pan up to see his face,just her. It's what they call the money shot.  Then, when his cock's gone down, and blood's congealed, we see his face. He looks all dazed and healed. Some feeders come and take him out of there.Down in the pens he's chained beside McBride.Deep in the mud lie carcasses picked cleanwho grin at them and dream of being soup. Poor things. We're almost done. We'll leave them there. CUT to some lonely doorway, where A TRAMPhas three cold fingers up ANOTHER TRAMP,they're starving but they fingerfuck like hell,and underneath the layers of old clothesbeneath the cardboard, newspaper and cloth,their genders are impossible to tell. PAN UP: to watch a butterfly go past.
SM_ch35	SM	Smoke and Mirrors	35	212	1119	AppleIn the end, the Lord gave Mankind the world. All the world was Man's, save for one garden. This is my garden, saith the Lord, and here you shall not enter.There was a man and a woman, who came to the garden, and their names were Earth and Breath.They had with them a small fruit which the Man carried, and when they arrived at the gate to the garden, the Man gave the fruit to the Woman, and the Woman gave the fruit to the Serpent with the flaming sword who guarded the Eastern Gate.And the Serpent took the fruit and placed it on a tree, in the centre of the garden.Then Earth and Breath knew their clothedness, and removed their garments, one by one, until they were naked; and when the Lord walked through the garden he saw the man and the woman, who no longer knew good from evil, but were satisfied.Then the Lord opened the gates and gave Mankind the garden, and the Serpent he raised up, and it walked away proudly on four legs; and where it went then no man can say.And after that there was nothing but silence in the Garden, save for the occasional sound of the man taking away a name from another animal.
ST_ch1	ST	Stardust	1	7539	42564	CHAPTER ONEIn Which We Learn of the Village of Wall, and of the Curious Thing That Occurs There Every Nine YearsThere was once a young man who wished to gain his Heart's Desire.And while that is, as beginnings go, not entirely novel (for every tale about every young man there ever was or will be could start in a similar manner) there was much about this young man and what happened to him that was unusual, although even he never knew the whole of it.The tale started, as many tales have started, in Wall.The town of Wall stands today as it has stood for six hundred years, on a high jut of granite amidst a small forest woodland. The houses of Wall are square and old, built of grey stone, with dark slate roofs and high chimneys; taking advantage of every inch of space on the rock, the houses lean into each other, are built one upon the next, with here and there a bush or tree growing out of the side of a building.There is one road from Wall, a winding track rising sharply up from the forest, where it is lined with rocks and small stones. Followed far enough south, out of the forest, the track becomes a real road, paved with asphalt; followed further the road gets larger, is packed at all hours with cars and trucks rushing from city to city. Eventually the road takes you to London, but London is a whole night's drive from Wall.The inhabitants of Wall are a taciturn breed, falling into two distinct types: the native Wall-folk, as grey and tall and stocky as the granite outcrop their town was built upon; and the others, who have made Wall their home over the years, and their descendants.Below Wall on the west is the forest; to the south is a treacherously placid lake served by the streams that drop from the hills behind Wall to the north. There are fields upon the hills, on which sheep graze. To the east is more woodland.Immediately to the east of Wall is a high grey rock wall, from which the town takes its name. This wall is old, built of rough, square lumps of hewn granite, and it comes from the woods and goes back to the woods once more.There is only one break in the wall; an opening about six feet in width, a little to the north of the village.Through the gap in the wall can be seen a large green meadow; beyond the meadow, a stream; and beyond the stream there are trees. From time to time shapes and figures can be seen, amongst the trees, in the distance. Huge shapes and odd shapes and small, glimmering things which flash and glitter and are gone. Although it is perfectly good meadow-land, none of the villagers has ever grazed animals on the meadow on the other side of the wall. Nor have they used it for growing crops.Instead, for hundreds, perhaps for thousands of years, they have posted guards on each side of the opening on the wall, and done their best to put it out of their minds.Even today, two townsmen stand on either side of the opening, night and day, taking eight-hour shifts. They carry hefty wooden cudgels. They flank the opening on the town side.Their main function is to prevent the town's children from going through the opening, into the meadow and beyond. Occasionally they are called upon to discourage a solitary rambler, or one of the few visitors to the town, from going through the gateway.The children they discourage simply with displays of the cudgel. Where ramblers and visitors are concerned, they are more inventive, only using physical force as a last resort if tales of new-planted grass, or a dangerous bull on the loose, are not sufficient.Very rarely someone comes to Wall knowing what they are looking for, and these people they will sometimes allow through. There is a look in the eyes, and once seen it cannot be mistaken.There have been no cases of smuggling across the wall in all the Twentieth Century, that the townsfolk know of, and they pride themselves on this.The guard is relaxed once every nine years, on May Day, when a fair comes to the meadow.The events that follow transpired many years ago. Queen Victoria was on the throne of England, but she was not yet the black-clad widow of Windsor: she had apples in her cheeks and a spring in her step, and Lord Melbourne often had cause to upbraid, gently, the young queen for her flightmess. She was, as yet, unmarried, although she was very much in love.Mr. Charles Dickens was serializing his novel Oliver Twist; Mr. Draper had just taken the first photograph of the moon, freezing her pale face on cold paper; Mr. Morse had recently announced a way of transmitting messages down metal wires.Had you mentioned magic or Faerie to any of them, they would have smiled at you disdainfully, except, perhaps for Mr. Dickens, at the time a young man, and beardless. He would have looked at you wistfully.People were coming to the British Isles that spring. They came in ones, and they came in twos, and they landed at Dover or in London or in Liverpool: men and women with skins as pale as paper, skins as dark as volcanic rock, skins the color of cinnamon, speaking in a multitude of tongues. They arrived all through April, and they traveled by steam train, by horse, by caravan or cart, and many of them walked.At that time Dunstan Thorn was eighteen, and he was not a romantic.He had nut-brown hair, and nut-brown eyes, and nut-brown freckles. He was middling tall, and slow of speech. He had an easy smile, which illuminated his face from within, and he dreamed, when he daydreamed in his father's meadow, of leaving the village of Wall and all its unpredictable charm, and going to London, or Edinburgh, or Dublin, or some great town where nothing was dependent on which way the wind was blowing. He worked on his father's farm and owned nothing save a small cottage in a far field given to him by his parents.Visitors were coming to Wall that April for the fair, and Dunstan resented them. Mr. Bromios's inn, the Seventh Magpie, normally a warren of empty rooms, had filled a week earlier, and now the strangers had begun to take rooms in the farms and private houses, paying for their lodgings with strange coins, with herbs and spices, and even with gemstones. As the day of the fair approached the atmosphere of anticipation mounted. People were waking earlier, counting days, counting minutes. The guards on the gate, at the sides of the wall, were restive and nervous. Figures and shadows moved in the trees at the edge of the meadow.In the Seventh Magpie, Bridget Comfrey, who was widely regarded as the most beautiful pot-girl in living memory, was provoking friction between Tommy Forester, with whom she had been seen to step out over the previous year, and a huge man with dark eyes and a small, cluttering monkey.The man spoke little English, but he smiled expressively whenever Bridget came by.In the pub's taproom the regulars sat in awkward proximity to the visitors, speaking so: ""It's only every nine years.""""They say in the old days it was every year, at midsummer.""""Ask Mister Bromios. He'll know."" Mr. Bromios was tall, and his skin was olive; his black hair was curled tightly on his head; his eyes were green. As the girls of the village became women they took notice of Mr. Bromios, but he did not return their notice. It was said he had come to the village quite some time ago, a visitor. But he had stayed in the village; and his wine was good, so the locals agreed.A loud argument broke out in the public lounge between Tommy Forester and the dark-eyed man, whose name appeared to be Alum Bey.""Stop them! In the name of Heaven! Stop them!"" shouted Bridget. ""They're going out the back to fight over me!"" And she tossed her head, prettily, so that the light of the oil lamps caught her perfect golden curls.Nobody moved to stop the men, although a number of people, villagers and newcomers alike, went outside to spectate.Tommy Forester removed his shirt and raised his fists in front of him. The stranger laughed, and spat onto the grass, and then he seized Tommy's right hand and sent him flying onto the ground, chin-first. Tommy clambered to his feet and ran at the stranger. He landed a glancing blow on the man's cheek, before finding himself facedown in the dirt, his face being slammed into the mud, with the wind knocked out of him. Alum Bey sat on top of him and chuckled, and said something in Arabic.That quickly, and that easily, the fight was over.Alum Bey climbed off Tommy Forester and he strutted over to Bridget Comfrey, bowed low to her, and grinned with gleaming teeth.Bridget ignored him, and ran to Tommy. ""Why, whatever has he done to you, my sweet?"" she asked, and mopped the mud from his face with her apron and called him all manner of endearments.Alum Bey went, with the spectators, back into the public rooms of the inn, and he graciously bought Tommy Forester a bottle of Mr. Bromios's Chablis when Tommy returned. Neither of them was quite certain who had won, who had lost.Dunstan Thorn was not in the Seventh Magpie that evening: he was a practical lad, who had, for the last six months, been courting Daisy Hempstock, a young woman of similar practicality. They would walk, on fair evenings, around the village, and discuss the theory of crop rotation, and the weather, and other such sensible matters; and on these walks, upon which they were invariably accompanied by Daisy's mother and younger sister walking a healthy six paces behind, they would, from time to time, stare at each other lovingly.At the door to the Hempstocks' Dunstan would pause, and bow, and take his farewell.And Daisy Hempstock would walk into her house, and remove her bonnet, and say, ""I do so wish Mister Thorn would make up his mind to propose. I am sure Papa would not be averse to it.""""Indeed, I am sure that he would not,"" said Daisy's mama on this evening, as she said on every such evening, and she removed her own bonnet and her gloves and led her daughters to the drawing room, in which a very tall gentleman with a very long black beard was sitting, sorting through his pack. Daisy, and her mama, and her sister, bobbed curtseys to the gentleman (who spoke little English, and had arrived a few days before). The temporary lodger, in his turn, stood and bowed to them, then returned to his pack of wooden oddments, sorting, arranging and polishing.It was chilly that April, with the awkward changeability of English spring.The visitors came up the narrow road through the forest from the south; they filled the spare-rooms, they bunked out in cow byres and barns. Some of them raised colored tents, some of them arrived in their own caravans drawn by huge grey horses or by small, shaggy ponies.In the forest there was a carpet of bluebells. On the morning of April the 29th Dunstan Thorn drew guard duty on the gap in the wall, with Tommy Forester. They stood on each side of the gap in the wall, and they waited.Dunstan had done guard duty many times before, but hitherto his task had consisted of simply standing, and, on occasion, shooing away children.Today he felt important: he held a wooden cudgel, and as each stranger to the village came up to the break in the wall, Dunstan or Tommy would say ""Tomorrow, tomorrow. No one's coming through today, good sirs.""And the strangers would retreat a little way, and stare through the break in the wall at the unassuming meadow beyond it, at the unexceptional trees that dotted the meadow, at the rather dull forest behind it. Some of them attempted to strike up conversations with Dunstan or Tommy, but the young men, proud of their status as guards, declined to converse, contenting themselves by raising their heads, tightening their lips, and generally looking important.At lunchtime, Daisy Hempstock brought by a small pot of shepherd's pie for them both, and Bridget Comfrey brought them each a mug of spiced ale.And, at twilight, another two able-bodied young men of the village arrived to relieve them, carrying a lantern each, and Tommy and Dunstan walked down to the inn where Mr. Bromios gave each of them a mug of his best ale-and his best ale was very fine indeed-as their reward for doing guard duty. There was a buzz of excitement in the inn, now crowded beyond believing. It was filled with visitors to the village from every nation in the world, or so it seemed to Dunstan who had no sense of distance beyond the woods that surrounded the village of Wall, so he regarded the tall gentleman in the black top hat at the table beside him, all the way up from London, with as much awe as he regarded the taller ebony-colored gentleman in the white one-piece robe with whom he was dining. Dunstan knew that it was rude to stare, and that, as a villager of Wall, he had every right to feel superior to all of the ""furriners."" But he could smell unfamilar spices on the air, and hear men and women speaking to each other in a hundred tongues, and he gawked and gazed unashamedly.The man in the black silk top hat noticed that Dunstan was staring at him, and motioned the lad over to him. ""D'you like treacle pudden'?"" he asked abruptly, by way of introduction. ""Mutanabbi was called away, and there's more pudden' here than a man can manage on his own.""Dunstan nodded. The treacle pudding was steaming invitingly on its plate.""Well then,"" said his new friend, ""help yourself."" He passed Dunstan a clean china bowl and a spoon. Dunstan needed no further encouragement, and he began to demolish the pudding.""Now, young 'un,"" said the tall gentleman in the black silk top hat to Dunstan, once their bowls and the pudding-plate were quite empty, ""it'd seem the inn has no more rooms; also that every room in the village has already been let."" ""Is that so?"" said Dunstan, unsurprised. ""That it is,"" said the gentleman in the top hat. ""And what I was wondering was, would you know of a house that might have a room?""Dunstan shrugged. ""All the rooms have gone by now,"" he said. ""I remember that when I was a boy of nine, my mother and my father sent me to sleep out in the rafters of the cow byre for a week, and let my room to a lady from the Orient, and her family and servants. She left me a kite, as a thank you, and I flew it from the meadow until one day it snapped its string and flew away into the sky.""""Where do you live now?"" asked the gentleman in the top hat.""I have a cottage on the edge of my father's land,"" Dunstan replied. ""It was our shepherd's cottage, until he died, two years ago last lammas-tide, and my parents gave it to me.""""Take me to it,"" said the gentleman in the hat, and it did not occur to Dunstan to refuse him.The spring moon was high and bright, and the night was clear. They walked down from the village to the forest beneath it, and they walked the whole way past the Thorn family farm (where the gentleman in the top hat was startled by a cow, sleeping in the meadow, which snorted as it dreamed) until they reached Dunstan's cottage.It had one room and a fireplace. The stranger nodded. ""I like this well enough,"" he said. ""Come, Dunstan Thorn, I'll rent it from you for the next three days.""""What'll you give me for it?""""A golden sovereign, a silver sixpence, a copper penny, and a fresh shiny farthing,"" said the man.Now a golden sovereign for two nights was more than a fair rent, in the days when a farm-worker might hope to make fifteen pounds in a good year. Still, Dunstan hesitated. ""If you're here for the market,"" he told the tall man, ""then it's miracles and wonders you'll be trading.""The tall man nodded. ""So, it would be miracles and wonders that you would be after, is it?"" He looked around Dunstan's one-room cottage again. It began to rain then, a gentle pattering on the thatch above them.""Oh, very well,"" said the tall gentleman, a trifle testily, ""a miracle, a wonder. Tomorrow, you shall attain your Heart's Desire. Now, here is your money,"" and he took it from Dunstan's ear, with one easy gesture. Dunstan touched it to the iron nail on the cottage door, checking for faerie gold, then he bowed low to the gentleman, and walked off into the rain. He tied the money up in his handkerchief.Dunstan walked to the cow byre in the pelting rain. He climbed into the hayloft and was soon asleep.He was aware, in the night, of thunder and of lightning, although he did not wake; and then in the small hours of the morning he was woken by someone treading, awkwardly, on his feet.""Sorry,"" said a voice. ""That is to say, 'scuse me."" ""Who's that? Who's there?"" said Dunstan. ""Just me,"" said the voice. ""I'm here for the market. I was sleeping in a hollow tree for the night, but the lightnin' toppled it, cracked it like an egg it did and smashed it like a twig, and the rain got down my neck, and it threatened to get into my baggage, and there's things in there must be kept dry as dust, and I'd kept it safe as houses on all my travelings here, though it was wet as...""""Water?"" suggested Dunstan.""Ever-so,"" continued the voice in the darkness. ""So I was wonderin',"" it continued, ""if you'd mind me stayin' here under your roof as I'm not very big, and I'd not disturb you or nothing.""""Just don't tread on me,"" sighed Dunstan. It was then that a flash of lightning illuminated the byre, and in the light, Dunstan saw something small and hairy in the corner, wearing a large floppy hat. And then, darkness.""I hope I'm not disturbin' you,"" said the voice, which certainly sounded rather hairy, now Dunstan thought about it. ""You aren't,"" said Dunstan, who was very tired. ""That's good,"" said the hairy voice, ""because I wouldn't want to disturb you.""""Please,"" begged Dunstan, ""let me sleep. Please.""There was a snuffling noise, which was replaced by a gentle snoring.Dunstan rolled over in the hay. The person, whoever, whatever it was, farted, scratched itself, and began to snore once more.Dunstan listened to the rain on the byre roof, and thought about Daisy Hempstock, and in his thoughts they were walking together, and six steps behind them walked a tall man with a top hat and a small, furry creature whose face Dunstan could not see. They were off to see his Heart's Desire...There was bright sunlight on his face, and the cow byre was empty. He washed his face, and walked up to the farmhouse.He put on his very best jacket, and his very best shirt, and his very best britches. He scraped the mud from his boots with his pocketknife. Then he walked into the farm kitchen, and kissed his mother on the cheek, and helped himself to a cottage loaf and a large pat of fresh-churned butter.And then, with his money tied up in his fine Sunday cambric handkerchief, he walked up to the village of Wall and bade good morning to the guards on the gate.Through the gap in the wall he could see colored tents being raised, stalls being erected, colored flags, and people walking back and forth.""We're not to let anyone through until midday,"" said the guard.Dunstan shrugged, and went to the pub, where he pondered what he would buy with his savings (the shiny half-crown he had saved, and the lucky sixpence, with a hole drilled through it, on a leather thong around his neck) and with the additional pocket handkerchief filled with coins. He had, for the moment, quite forgotten there had been anything else promised the night before. At the stroke of midday Dunstan strode up to the wall and, nervously, as if he were breaking the greatest of taboos, he walked through beside, as he realized, the gentleman in the black silk top hat, who nodded to him.""Ah. My landlord. And how are you today, sir?""""Very well,"" said Dunstan.""Walk with me,"" said the tall man. ""Let us walk together.""They walked across the meadow, toward the tents.""Have you been here before?"" asked the tall man.""I went to the last market, nine years ago. I was only a boy,"" admitted Dunstan.""Well,"" said his tenant, ""remember to be polite, and take no gifts. Remember that you're a guest. And now, I shall give you the last part of the rent that I owe you. For I swore an oath. And my gifts last a long time. You and your firstborn child and his or her firstborn child... It's a gift that will last as long as I live.""""And what would that be, sir?""""Your Heart's Desire, remember,"" said the gentleman in the top hat. ""Your Heart's Desire.""Dunstan bowed, and they walked on toward the fair.""Eyes, eyes! New eyes for old!"" shouted a tiny woman in front of a table covered with bottles and jars filled with eyes of every kind and color.""Instruments of music from a hundred lands!"" ""Penny whistles! Tuppenny hums! Threepenny choral anthems!""""Try your luck! Step right up! Answer a simple riddle and win a wind-flower!""""Everlasting lavender! Bluebell cloth!"" ""Bottled dreams, a shilling a bottle!"" ""Coats of night! Coats of twilight! Coats of dusk!"" ""Swords of fortune! Wands of power! Rings of eternity! Cards of grace! Roll-up, roll-up, step this way!"" ""Salves and ointments, philtres and nostrums!"" Dunstan paused in front of a stall covered with tiny crystal ornaments; he examined the miniature animals, pondering getting one for Daisy Hempstock. He picked up a crystal cat, no bigger than his thumb. Sagely it blinked at him, and he dropped it, shocked; it righted itself in midair and, like a real cat, fell on its four paws. Then it stalked over to the corner of the stall and began to wash itself.Dunstan walked on, through the thronged market. It was bustling with people; all the strangers who had come to Wall in the previous weeks were there, and many of the inhabitants of the town of Wall as well. Mr. Bromios had set up a wine-tent and was selling wines and pasties to the village folk, who were often tempted by the foods being sold by the folk from Beyond the Wall but had been told by their grandparents, who had got it from their grandparents, that it was deeply, utterly wrong to eat fairy food, to eat fairy fruit, to drink fairy water and sip fairy wine.For every nine years, the folk from Beyond the Wall and over the hill set up their stalls, and for a day and a night the meadow played host to the Faerie Market; and there was, for one day and one night in nine years, commerce between the nations.There were wonders for sale, and marvels, and miracles; there were things undreamed-of and objects unimagined (what need, Dunstan wondered, could someone have of the storm-filled eggshells?). He jingled his money in his pocket handkerchief, and looked for something small and inexpensive with which to amuse Daisy.He heard a gentle chiming in the air, above the hubbub of the market; and this he walked toward.He passed a stall in which five huge men were dancing to the music of a lugubrious hurdy-gurdy being played by a mournful-looking black bear; he passed a stall where a balding man in a brightly colored kimono was smashing china plates and tossing them into a burning bowl from which colored smoke was pouring, all the while calling out to the passersby.The chinkling chiming grew louder.Reaching the stall from which the sound was emanating, he saw that it was deserted. It was festooned with flowers: bluebells and foxgloves and harebells and daffodils, but also with violets and lilies, with tiny crimson dog-roses, pale snowdrops, blue forget-me-nots and a profusion of other flowers Dunstan could not name. Each flower was made of glass or crystal, spun or carved, he could not tell: they counterfeited life perfectly. And they chimed and jingled like distant glass bells.""Hello?"" called Dunstan.""Good morrow to you, on this Market Day,"" said the stall holder, clambering down from the painted caravan parked behind the stall, and she smiled widely at him with white teeth in a dusky face. She was one of the folk from Beyond the Wall, he could tell at once from her eyes, and her ears which were visible beneath her curly black hair. Her eyes were a deep violet, while her ears were the ears of a cat, perhaps, gently curved, and dusted with a fine, dark fur. She was quite beautiful.Dunstan picked up a flower from the stall. ""It's very lovely,"" he said. It was a violet, and it chinkled and sang as he held it, making a noise similar to that produced by wetting a finger and rubbing it, gently, around a wineglass. ""How much is it?""She shrugged, and a delightful shrug it was.""The cost is never discussed at the outset,"" she told him. ""It might be a great deal more than you are prepared to pay; and then you would leave, and we would both be the poorer for it. Let us discuss the merchandise in a more general way.""Dunstan paused. It was then that the gentleman with the black silk top hat passed by the stall. ""There,"" murmured Dunston's lodger. ""My debt to you is settled, and my rent is paid in full.""Dunstan shook his head, as if to clear it of a dream, and turned back to the young lady. ""So where do these flowers come from?"" he asked.She smiled knowingly.""On the side of Mount Calamon a grove of glass flowers grows. The journey there is perilous, and the journey back is more so.""""And of what purpose are they?"" asked Dunstan.""The use and function of these flowers is chiefly decorative and recreational; they bring pleasure; they can be given to a loved one as a token of admiration and affection, and the sound they make is pleasing to the ear. Also, they catch the light most delightfully."" She held a bluebell up to the light; and Dunstan could not but observe that the color of sunlight glittering through the purple crystal was inferior in both hue and shade to that of her eyes.""I see,"" said Dunstan.""They are also used in certain spells and cantrips. If sir is a magician...?""Dunstan shook his head. There was, he noticed, something remarkable about the young lady.""Ah. Even so, they are delightful things,"" she said, and smiled again.The remarkable thing was a thin silver chain that ran from the young lady's wrist, down to her ankle and into the painted caravan behind her.Dunstan remarked upon it.""The chain? It binds me to the stall. I am the personal slave of the witch-woman who owns the stall. She caught me many years ago-as I played by the waterfalls in my father's lands, high in the mountains-luring me on and on in the form of a pretty frog always but a moment out of my reach, until I had left my father's lands, unwittingly, whereupon she resumed her true shape and popped me into a sack.""""And you are her slave forever?""""Not forever,"" and at that the faerie girl smiled. ""I gain my freedom on the day the moon loses her daughter, if that occurs in a week when two Mondays come together. I await it with patience. And in the meantime I do as I am bid, and also I dream. Will you buy a flower from me now, young master?""""My name is Dunstan.""""And an honest name it is, too,"" she said with a teasing grin. ""Where are your pincers, Master Dunstan? Will you catch the devil by the nose?""""And what is your name?"" asked Dunstan, blushing a deep red.""I no longer have a name. I am a slave, and the name I had was taken from me. I answer to 'hey, you!' or to 'girl!' or to 'foolish slattern!' or to many another imprecation.""Dunstan noticed how the silken fabric of her robe pressed itself against her body; he was aware of elegant curves, and of her violet eyes upon him, and he swallowed.Dunstan put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his kerchief. He could no longer look at the woman. He tumbled out his money onto the counter. ""Take enough for this,"" he said, picking a pure white snowdrop from the table.""We do not take money at this stall."" She pushed the coins back toward him.""No? What will you take?"" For by now he was quite agitated, and his only mission was to obtain a flower for... for Daisy, Daisy Hempstock... to obtain his flower and to depart, for, truth to tell, the young lady was making him exceedingly uncomfortable.""I could take the color of your hair,"" she said, ""or all of your memories before you were three years of age. I could take the hearing from your left ear-not all of it, just enough that you'd not enjoy music or appreciate the running of a river or the soughing of the wind.""Dunstan shook his head.""Or a kiss from you. One kiss, here on my cheek.""""That I'll pay with goodwill!"" said Dunstan, and with that he leaned across the stall, amid the twinkling jingling of the crystal flowers, and planted a chaste kiss on her soft cheek. He smelled the scent of her then, intoxicating, magical; it filled the front of his head and his chest and his mind.""There, now,"" she said, and she passed him his snowdrop. He took it with hands that suddenly seemed to him to be huge and clumsy and not at all small and in every way perfect like the hands of the faerie girl. ""And I'll see you back here tonight, Dunstan Thorn, when the moon goes down. Come here and hoot like a little owl. Can you do that?""He nodded, and stumbled away from her; he did not need to ask how she knew his surname; she had taken it from him along with certain other things, such as his heart, when he had kissed her.The snowdrop chimed in his hand.Why, Dunstan Thorn,"" said Daisy Hempstock, when he encountered her by Mr. Bromios's tent, sitting with her family and Dunstan's parents, eating great brown sausages and drinking porter, ""whatever is the matter?""""I brought you a gift,"" Dunstan muttered, and thrust the chiming snowdrop toward her; it glinted in the afternoon sunlight. She took it from him, puzzled, with fingers still shiny with sausage grease. Impulsively, Dunstan leaned forward and, in front of her mother and father and sister, in front of Bridget Comfrey and Mr. Bromios and all, he kissed her on her fair cheek.The outcry was predictable; but Mr. Hempstock, who had not lived on the border of Faerie and the Lands Beyond for fifty-seven years for nothing, exclaimed, ""Hush, now! Look at his eyes. Can't you see the poor boy's dazed in his wits, dazed and confused? He's bespelled, I'll wager you. Hoy! Tommy Forester! Come here; take young Dunstan Thorn back to the village and keep an eye on him; let him sleep if he wishes, or talk if it's talk he needs...""Tommy walked Dunstan out of the market and back to the village of Wall.""There, now, Daisy,"" said her mother, stroking her hair, ""he's just a little elf-touched, that's all. No need to take on so."" And she pulled a lace kerchief from her capacious bosom, and dabbed at her daughter's cheeks, which had suddenly become covered with tears.Daisy looked up at her, and seized the handkerchief, and blew her nose upon it, and sniffled into it. And Mrs. Hempstock observed, with a certain perplexity, that Daisy appeared to be smiling through her tears.""But Mother, Dunstan kissed me"" said Daisy Hempstock, and she fixed the crystal snowdrop at the front of her bonnet, where it chimed and glistened.After some time spent searching for it, Mr. Hempstock and Dunstan's father found the stall where the crystal flowers were being sold; but the stall was being run by an elderly woman, accompanied by an exotic and very beautiful bird, which was chained to its perch by a thin silver chain. There was no reasoning with the old woman, for when they tried to question her about what had happened to Dunstan, all her talk was of one of the prizes of her collection, given away by a good-for-nothing, and that was what came of ingratitude, and of these sad modern times, and of today's servants.In the empty village (for who'd be in the village during the Faerie Market?), Dunstan was taken into the Seventh Magpie, and given a wooden settle on which to sit. He rested his forehead on his hand, and stared off into no-one-knows-where and, from time to time, sighed huge sighs, like the wind.Tommy Forester tried to talk to him, saying ""Now then, old fellow, buck up, that's the ticket, let's see a smile, eh? How's about something to eat then? Or something to drink? No? My word, you do look queer, Dunstan, old fellow..."" but gaining no response of any kind, Tommy began to pine after the market himself, where even now (he rubbed his tender jaw) the lovely Bridget was undoubtedly being escorted by some huge and imposing gentleman with exotic clothes and a little monkey that chattered. And, having assured himself that his friend would be safe in the empty inn, Tommy walked back through the village to the gap in the wall.As Tommy reentered the market, he observed that the place was a hubbub: a wild place of puppet shows, of jugglers and dancing animals, of horses for auction and all kinds of things for sale or barter.Later, at twilight, a different kind of people came out. There was a crier, who cried news as a modern newspaper prints headlines-""The Master of Stormhold Suffers a Mysterious Malady!"", ""The Hill of Fire Has Moved to the Fastness of Dene!"", ""The Squire of Garamond's Only Heir is Transformed into a Grunting Pig-wiggin!""-and would for a coin expand further on these stories.The sun set, and a huge spring moon appeared, high already in the heavens. A chill breeze blew. Now the traders retreated into their tents, and the visitors to the market found themselves whispered at, invited to partake of numerous wonders, each available for a price.And as the moon came low on the horizon Dunstan Thorn walked quietly down the cobbled streets of the village of Wall. He passed many a merry-maker-visitor or foreigner-although few enough of them observed him as he walked.He slipped through the gap in the wall-thick it was, the wall-and Dunstan found himself wondering, as his father had before him, what would happen were he to walk along the top of it.Through the gap and into the meadow, and that night, for the first time in his life, Dunstan entertained thoughts of continuing on through the meadow, of crossing the stream and vanishing into the trees on its far side. He entertained these thoughts awkwardly, as a man entertains unexpected guests. Then, as he reached his objective, he pushed these thoughts away, as a man apologizes to his guests, and leaves them, muttering something about a prior engagement.The moon was setting.Dunstan raised his hands to his mouth and hooted. There was no response; the sky above was a deep color-blue perhaps, or purple, not black-sprinkled with more stars than the mind could hold.He hooted once more.""That,"" she said severely in his ear, ""is nothing like a little owl. A snowy owl it could be, a barn owl, even. If my ears were stopped up with twigs perhaps I'd imagine it an eagle-owl. But it's not a little owl.""Dunstan shrugged, and grinned, a little foolishly. The faerie woman sat down beside him. She intoxicated him: he was breathing her, sensing her through the pores of his skin. She leaned close to him.""Do you think you are under a spell, pretty Dunstan?""""I do not know.""She laughed, and the sound was a clear rill bubbling over rocks and stones.""You are under no spell, pretty boy, pretty boy."" She lay back in the grass and stared up at the sky. ""Your stars,"" she asked. ""What are they like?"" Dunstan lay beside her in the cool grass, and stared up at the night sky. There was certainly something odd about the stars: perhaps there was more color in them, for they glittered like tiny gems; perhaps there was something about the number of tiny stars, the constellations; something was strange and wonderful about the stars. But then...They lay back to back, staring up at the sky.""What do you want from life?"" asked the faerie lass.""I don't know,"" he admitted. ""You, I think.""""I want my freedom,"" she said.Dunstan reached down to the silver chain that ran from her wrist to her ankle, and off away in the grass. He tugged on it. It was stronger than it looked.""It was fashioned of cat's breath and fish-scales and moonlight mixed in with the silver,"" she told him. ""Unbreakable until the terms of the spell are concluded.""""Oh."" He moved back onto the grass.""I should not mind it, for it is a long, long chain; but the knowledge of it irks me, and I miss my father's land. And the witch-woman is not the best of mistresses...""And she was quiet. Dunstan leaned over toward her, reached a hand up to her face, felt something wet and hot splash against his hand.""Why, you are crying.""She said nothing. Dunstan pulled her toward him, wiping ineffectually at her face with his big hand; and then he leaned into her sobbing face and, tentatively, uncertain of whether or not he was doing the correct thing given the circumstances, he kissed her, full upon her burning lips.There was a moment of hesitation, and then her mouth opened against his, and her tongue slid into his mouth, and he was, under the strange stars, utterly, irrevocably, lost.He had kissed before, with the girls of the village, but he had gone no further.His hand felt her small breasts through the silk of her dress, touched the hard nubs of her nipples. She clung to him, hard, as if she were drowning, fumbling with his shirt, with his britches.She was so small; he was scared he would hurt her and break her. He did not. She wriggled and writhed beneath him, gasping and kicking, and guiding him with her hand.She placed a hundred burning kisses on his face and chest, and then she was above him, straddling him, gasping and laughing, sweating and slippery as a minnow, and he was arching and pushing and exulting, his head full of her and only her, and had he known her name he would have called it out aloud.At the end, he would have pulled out, but she held him inside her, wrapped her legs around him, pushed against him so hard that he felt that the two of them occupied the same place in the universe. As if, for one powerful, engulfing moment, they were the same person, giving and receiving, as the stars faded into the predawn sky.They lay together, side by side.The faerie woman adjusted her silk robe and was once more decorously covered. Dunstan pulled his britches back up, with regret. He squeezed her small hand in his.The sweat dried on his skin, and he felt chilled and lonely.He could see her now, as the sky lightened into a dawn grey. Around them animals were stirring: horses stamped, birds began, waking, to sing the dawn in, and here and there across the market meadow, those in the tents were beginning to rise and move. ""Now, get along with you,"" she said softly, and looked at him, half regretfully, with eyes as violet as the cirrus clouds, high in the dawn sky. And she kissed him, gently, on the mouth, with lips that tasted of crushed blackberries, then she stood up and walked back into the gypsy caravan behind the stall.Dazed and alone, Dunstan walked through the market, feeling a great deal older than his eighteen years.He returned to the cow byre, took off his boots, and slept until he woke, when the sun was high in the sky.On the following day the market finished, although Dunstan did not return to it, and the foreigners left the village and life in Wall returned to normal, which was perhaps slightly less normal than life in most villages (particularly when the wind was in the wrong direction) but was, all things considered, normal enough.Two weeks after the market, Tommy Forester proposed marriage to Bridget Comfrey, and she accepted. And the week after that, Mrs. Hempstock came to visit Mrs. Thorn of a morning. They took tea in the parlor.""It is a blessing about the Forester boy,"" said Mrs. Hempstock.""That it is,"" said Mrs. Thorn. ""Have another scone, my dear. I expect your Daisy shall be a bridesmaid.""""I trust she shall,"" said Mrs. Hempstock, ""if she should live so long.""Mrs. Thorn looked up, alarmed. ""Why, she is not ill, Mrs. Hempstock? Say it is not so.""""She does not eat, Mrs. Thorn. She wastes away. She drinks a little water from time to time.""""Oh, my!""Mrs. Hempstock went on,""Last night I finally discovered the cause. It is your Dunstan.""""Dunstan? He has not..."" Mrs. Thorn raised one hand to her mouth.""Oh, no,"" said Mrs. Hempstock, hastily shaking her head and pursing her lips, ""nothing like that. He has ignored her. She has not seen him for days and days. She has taken it into her head that he no longer cares for her, and all she does is hold the snowdrop he gave her, and she sobs.""Mrs. Thorn measured out more tea from the jar into the pot, added hot water.""Truth to tell,"" she admitted, ""we're a little concerned about Dunstan, Thorney and me. He's been mooning. That's the only word for it. His work isn't getting done. Thorney was saying that he needs some settling down, that boy. If he'd but settle down, why Thorney was saying he'd settle all the Westward Meadows on the lad.""Mrs. Hempstock nodded slowly. ""Hempstock would certainly not be averse to seeing our Daisy happy. Certain he'd settle a flock of our sheep on the girl."" The Hempstocks' sheep were notoriously the finest for miles around: shaggy-coated and intelligent (for sheep), with curling horns and sharp hooves. Mrs. Hempstock and Mrs. Thorn sipped their tea. And so it was settled.Dunstan Thorn was married in June to Daisy Hempstock. And if the groom seemed a little distracted, well, the bride was as glowing and lovely as ever any bride has been.Behind them, their fathers discussed the plans for the farmhouse they would build for the newlyweds in the western meadow. Their mothers agreed how lovely Daisy looked, and what a pity it was that Dunstan had stopped Daisy from wearing the snowdrop he had bought for her at the market at the end of April, in her wedding dress.And it is there we will leave them, in a falling flurry of rose petals, scarlet and yellow and pink and white.Or almost.They lived in Dunstan's cottage, while their little farmhouse was erected, and they were certainly happy enough; and the day-to-day business of raising sheep, and herding sheep, and shearing them, and nursing them, slowly took the faraway look from Dunstan's eyes.First autumn came, then winter. It was at the end of February, in lambing season, when the world was cold, and a bitter wind howled down the moors and through the leafless forest, when icy rains fell from the leaden skies in continual drizzling showers, at six in the evening, after the sun had set and the sky was dark, that a wicker basket was pushed through the space in the wall. The guards, on each side of the gap, at first did not notice the basket. They were facing the wrong way, after all, and it was dark and wet, and they were busy stamping the ground and staring gloomily and longingly at the lights of the village.And then a high, keening wail began.It was then that they looked down, and saw the basket at their feet. There was a bundle in the basket: a bundle of oiled silk and woolen blankets, from the top of which protruded a red, bawling face, with screwed-up little eyes, a mouth, open and vocal, and hungry.And there was, attached to the baby's blanket with a silver pin, a scrap of parchment, upon which was written in an elegant, if slightly archaic, handwriting the following words:Tristran Thorn
ST_ch2	ST	Stardust	2	4866	27686	CHAPTER TWOIn Which Tristan Thorn Grows to Manhood and Makes a Rash PromiseYears passed.The next Faerie Market was held on schedule on the other side of the wall. Young Tristran Thorn, eight years old, did not attend, finding himself packed off to stay with extremely distant relations in a village a day's ride away.His little sister, Louisa, six months his junior, was, however, allowed to go to the market, and this was a source of great ranklement to the boy, as was the fact that Louisa brought back from the market a glass globe, filled with speckles of light that glittered and flashed in the twilight, and which cast a warm and gentle radiance into the darkness of their bedroom in the farmhouse, while all Tristran brought back from his relatives was a nasty case of the measles.Shortly afterward, the farm cat had three kittens: two black-and-white ones like herself, and a tiny kitten with a dusty blue sheen to her coat, and eyes that changed color depending on her mood, from green and gold to salmon, scarlet and vermilion.This kitten was given to Tristran to make up for missing the market. She grew slowly, the blue cat, and she was the sweetest cat in the world, until, one evening, she began to prowl the house impatiently, to mrowll and to flash her eyes, which were the purple-red of foxgloves; and when Tristran's father came back from a day in the fields, the cat yowled, bolted through the door and was off into the dusk.The guards on the wall were for people, not cats; and Tristran, who was twelve by this time, never saw the blue cat again. He was inconsolable for a while. His father came into his bedroom one night and sat at the end of his bed, saying gruffly, ""She'll be happier, over the wall. With her own kind. Don't you fret now, lad.""His mother said nothing to him about the matter, as she said little to him on any subject. Sometimes Tristran would look up to see his mother staring at him intently, as if she were trying to tease some secret from his face.Louisa, his sister, would needle him about this as they walked to the village school in the morning, as she would goad him about so many other things: the shape of his ears, for example (the right ear was flat against his head, and almost pointed; the left one was not), and about the foolish things he said: once he told her that the tiny clouds, fluffy and white, that clustered across the horizon at sunset as they walked home from school, were sheep. It was no matter that he later claimed that he had meant simply that they reminded him of sheep, or that there was something fluffy and sheeplike about them. Louisa laughed and teased and goaded like a goblin; and what was worse, she told the other children, and incited them to ""baa"" quietly whenever Tristran walked past. Louisa was a born inciter, and danced circles around her brother.The village school was a fine school, and under the tutelage of Mrs. Cherry the schoolmistress Tristran Thorn learned all about fractions, and longitude and latitude; he could ask in French for the pen of the gardener's aunt, indeed for the pen of his own aunt; he learned the kings and queens of England from William the Conqueror, 1066, to Victoria, 1837. He learned his reading, and had a fair copperplate hand. Travelers to the village were rare, but occasionally a peddler would come through the village, selling ""penny dreadful"" accounts of grisly murders, fateful encounters, dire doings and remarkable escapes. Most peddlers sold song sheets, two for a penny, and families would buy them and gather about their pianos to sing songs such as ""Cherry Ripe"" and ""In My Father's Garden.""So the days went by, and the weeks went by, and the years went by also. At age fourteen, by a process of osmosis, of dirty jokes, whispered secrets and filthy ballads, Tristran learned of sex. When he was fifteen he hurt his arm falling from the apple tree outside Mr. Thomas Forester's house: more specifically, from the apple tree outside Miss Victoria Forester's bedroom window. To Tristran's regret, he had caught no more than a pink and tantalizing glimpse of Victoria, who was his sister's age and, without any doubt, the most beautiful girl for a hundred miles around.By the time Victoria was seventeen, and Tristran also, she was in all probability, he was certain, the most beautiful girl in the British Isles. Tristran would have insisted on the most beautiful girl in the entire British Empire, if not the world, and boxed you, or been prepared to, had you argued with him. You would have been hard-pressed to find anyone in Wall who would have argued with him, though; she turned many heads and, in all probability, broke many hearts.A description: She had her mother's grey eyes and heart-shaped face, her father's curling chestnut hair. Her lips were red and perfectly shaped, her cheeks blushed prettily when she spoke. She was pale, and utterly delightful. When she was sixteen she had fought vigorously with her mother, for Victoria had taken it into her head that she would work in the Seventh Magpie as a pot-maid. ""I have spoken to Mister Bromios about this,"" she told her mother, ""and he has no objection.""""What Mister Bromios thinks or does not think,"" replied her mother, the former Bridget Comfrey ""is neither here nor there. That is a most improper occupation for a young lady.""The village of Wall watched the battle of wills with fascination, wondering what the outcome would be, for no one crossed Bridget Forester: she had a tongue that could, the villagers said, blister the paint from a barn door and tear the bark from an oak. There was no one in the village who would have wanted to get on the wrong side of Bridget Forester, and they did say that the wall would be more likely to walk than for Bridget Forester to change her mind.Victoria Forester, however, was used to having her own way, and, if all else failed, or even if it did not, she would appeal to her father, and he would accede to her demands. But here even Victoria was surprised, for her father agreed with her mother, saying that working in the bar at the Seventh Magpie was something that a well-brought-up young lady would not do. And Thomas Forester set his chin and there the matter ended.Every boy in the village was in love with Victoria Forester. And many a sedate gentleman, quietly married with grey in his beard, would stare at her as she walked down the street, becoming, for a few moments, a boy once more, in the spring of his years with a spring in his step.""They say that Mister Monday himself is counted amongst your admirers,"" said Louisa Thorn to Victoria Forester one afternoon in May, in the apple orchard.Five girls sat beside, and upon the branches of, the oldest apple tree in the orchard, its huge trunk making a fine seat and support; and whenever the May breeze blew, the pink blossoms tumbled down like snow, coming to rest in their hair and on their skirts. The afternoon sunlight dappled green and silver and gold through the leaves in the apple orchard.""Mister Monday,"" said Victoria Forester with disdain, ""is five and forty years of age if he is a day."" She made a face to indicate just how old five-and-forty is, when you happen to be seventeen.""Anyway,"" said Cecilia Hempstock, Louisa's cousin, ""he has already been married. I would not wish to marry someone who had already been married. It would be,"" she opined, ""like having someone else break in one's own pony.""""Personally I would imagine that to be the sole advantage of marrying a widower,"" said Amelia Robinson. ""That someone else would have removed the rough edges; broken him in, if you will. Also, I would imagine that by that age his lusts would long since have been sated, and abated, which would free one from a number of indignities.""A flurry of hastily suppressed giggles amid the apple blossom.""Still,"" said Lucy Pippin hesitantly, ""it would be nice to live in the big house, and to have a coach and four, and to be able to travel to London for the season, and to Bath to take the waters, or to Brighton for the sea-bathing, even if Mister Monday is five and forty.""The other girls shrieked, and flung handfuls of apple blossom at her, and none shrieked more loudly, or flung more blossom, than Victoria Forester.Tristran Thorn, at the age of seventeen, and only six months older than Victoria, was half the way between a boy and a man, and was equally uncomfortable in either role; he seemed to be composed chiefly of elbows and Adam's apples. His hair was the brown of sodden straw, and it stuck out at awkward, seventeen-year-old angles, wet and comb it howsoever much he tried.He was painfully shy, which, as is often the manner of the painfully shy, he overcompensated for by being too loud at the wrong times. Most days Tristran was content-or as content as a seventeen-year-old youth with his world ahead of him can ever be-and when he daydreamed in the fields, or at the tall desk at the back of Monday and Brown's, the village shop, he fancied himself riding the train all the way to London or to Liverpool, of taking a steamship across the grey Atlantic to America, and making his fortune there among the savages in the new lands.But there were times when the wind blew from beyond the wall, bringing with it the smell of mint and thyme and red-currants, and at those times there were strange colors seen in the flames in the fireplaces of the village. When that wind blew, the simplest of devices-from lucifer matches to lantern-slides-would no longer function.And, at those times, Tristran Thorn's daydreams were strange, guilty fantasies, muddled and odd, of journeys through forests to rescue princesses from palaces, dreams of knights and trolls and mermaids. And when these moods came upon him, he would slip out of the house, and lie upon the grass, and stare up at the stars.Few of us now have seen the stars as folk saw them then- our cities and towns cast too much light into the night-but, from the village of Wall, the stars were laid out like worlds or like ideas, uncountable as the trees in a forest or the leaves on a tree. Tristan would stare into the darkness of the sky until he thought of nothing at all, and then he would go back to his bed, and sleep like a dead man.He was a gangling creature of potential, a barrel of dynamite waiting for someone or something to light his fuse; but no one did, so on weekends and in the evenings he helped his father on the farm, and during the day he worked for Mr. Brown, at Monday and Brown's, as a clerk.Monday and Brown's was the village shop. While they kept a number of necessaries in stock, much of their business was conducted by means of lists: villagers would give Mr. Brown a list of what they needed, from potted meats to sheep-dip, from fish-knives to chimney-tiles; a clerk at Monday and Brown's would compile a master list of everything requested, and then Mr. Monday would take the master list, and a dray pulled by two huge shire horses, and he would set off for the nearest county town, and return in a handful of days with the dray loaded high with goods of all description.It was a cold, blustery day in late October, of the kind that always seems about to rain but never actually does, and it was late in the afternoon. Victoria Forester walked into Monday and Brown's with a list, written in her mother's precise handwriting, and she rang the small bell on the counter for service.She looked slightly disappointed to see Tristran Thorn appear from the back room. ""Good day, Miss Forester.""She smiled a tight smile, and handed Tristran her list.It read as follows:½ lb of sago10 cans of sardines1 bottle of mushroom ketchup5 lb of rice1 tin of golden syrup2 lb of currantsa bottle of cochineal1 lb of barley sugar1 shilling box of Rowntrees Elect Cocoa3d tin of Oakey's knife polish6d of Brunswick black1 packet of Swinbome's Isinglass1 bottle of furniture cream1 basting ladlea ninepenny gravy strainera set of kitchen stepsTristran read it to himself, looking for something about which he could begin to talk: a conversational gambit of some kind-any kind.He heard his voice saying, ""You'll be having rice pudding, then, I would imagine, Miss Forester."" As soon as he said it, he knew it had been the wrong thing to say. Victoria pursed her perfect lips, and blinked her grey eyes, and said, ""Yes, Tristran. We shall be having rice pudding.""And then she smiled at him, and said, ""Mother says that rice pudding in sufficient quantity will help to stave off chills and colds and other autumnal ailments.""""My mother,"" Tristran confessed, ""has always sworn by tapioca pudding.""He put the list on a spike. ""We can deliver most of the provisions tomorrow morning, and the rest of it will come back with Mister Monday, early next week.""There was a gust of wind, then, so strong that it rattled the windows of the village, and whirled and spun the weathercocks until they could not tell north from west or south from east.The fire that was burning in the grate of Monday and Brown's belched and twisted in a flurry of greens and scarlets, topped with a fizz of silver twinkles, of the kind one can make for oneself at the parlor fire with a handful of tossed iron filings.The wind blew from Faerie and the East, and Tristran Thorn suddenly found inside himself a certain amount of courage he had not suspected that he had possessed. ""You know, Miss Forester, I get off in a few minutes,"" he said. ""Perhaps I could walk you a little way home. It's not much out of my way."" And he waited, his heart in his mouth, while Victoria Forester's grey eyes stared at him, amused. After what seemed like a hundred years she said, ""Certainly.""Tristran hurried into the parlor, and informed Mr. Brown that he would be off now. And Mr. Brown grunted in a not entirely ill-natured way, and told Tristran that when he was younger he'd not only had to stay late each night and shut up the shop, but that he had also had to sleep on the floor beneath the counter with only his coat for a pillow.Tristran agreed that he was indeed a lucky young man, and he wished Mr. Brown a good night, then he took his coat from the coat-stand and his new bowler hat from the hat-stand, and stepped out onto the cobblestones, where Victoria Forester waited for him.The autumn twilight turned into deep and early night as they walked. Tristran could smell the distant winter on the air-a mixture of night-mist and crisp darkness and the tang of fallen leaves.They took a winding lane up toward the Forester farm, and the crescent moon hung white in the sky and the stars burned in the darkness above them.""Victoria,"" said Tristran, after a while.""Yes, Tristran,"" said Victoria, who had been preoccupied for much of the walk.""Would you think it forward of me to kiss you?"" asked Tristran.""Yes,"" said Victoria bluntly and coldly. ""Very forward.""""Ah,"" said Tristran.They walked up Dyties Hill, not speaking; at the top of the hill they turned, and saw beneath them the village of Wall, all gleaming candles and lamps glimmering through windows, warm yellow lights that beckoned and invited; and above them the lights of the myriad stars, which glittered and twinkled and blazed, chilly and distant and more numerous than the mind could encompass.Tristran reached down his hand and took Victoria's small hand in his. She did not pull away.""Did you see that?"" asked Victoria, who was gazing out over the landscape.""I saw nothing,"" said Tristran. ""I was looking at you.""Victoria smiled in the moonlight.""You are the most lovely woman in all the world,"" said Tristran, from the bottom of his heart.""Get along with you,"" said Victoria, but she said it gently.""What did you see?"" asked Tristran.""A falling star,"" said Victoria. ""I believe they are not at all uncommon at this time of year.""""Vicky,"" said Tristran. ""Will you kiss me?""""No,"" she said.""You kissed me when we were younger. You kissed me beneath the pledge-Oak, on your fifteenth birthday. And you kissed me last May Day, behind your father's cowshed.""""I was another person then,"" she said. ""And I shall not kiss you, Tristran Thorn.""""If you will not kiss me,"" asked Tristran, ""will you marry me?""There was silence on the hill. Only the rustle of the October wind. Then a tinkling sound: it was the sound of the most beautiful girl in the whole of the British Isles laughing with delight and amusement.""Marry you?"" she repeated, incredulously. ""And why ever should I marry you, Tristran Thorn? What could you give me?""""Give you?"" he said. ""I would go to India for you, Victoria Forester, and bring you the tusks of elephants, and pearls as big as your thumb, and rubies the size of wren's eggs.""I would go to Africa, and bring you diamonds the size of cricket balls. I would find the source of the Nile, and name it after you.""I would go to America-all the way to San Francisco, to the gold-fields, and I would not come back until I had your weight in gold. Then I would carry it back here, and lay it at your feet.""I would travel to the distant northlands did you but say the word, and slay the mighty polar bears, and bring you back their hides.""""I think you were doing quite well,"" said Victoria Forester, ""until you got to the bit about slaying polar bears. Be that as it may, little shop-boy and farm-boy, I shall not kiss you; neither shall I marry you.""Tristran's eyes blazed in the moonlight. ""I would travel to far Cathay for you, and bring you a huge junk I would capture from the king of the pirates, laden with jade and silk and opium.""I would go to Australia, at the bottom of the world,"" said Tristran, ""and bring you. Um."" He ransacked the penny dreadfuls in his head, trying to remember if any of their heroes had visited Australia. ""A kangaroo,"" he said. ""And opals,"" he added. He was fairly sure about the opals.Victoria Forester squeezed his hand. ""And whatever would I do with a kangaroo?"" she asked. ""Now, we should be getting along, or my father and mother will be wondering what has kept me, and they will leap to some entirely unjustified conclusions. For I have not kissed you, Tristran Thorn.""""Kiss me,"" he pleaded. ""There is nothing I would not do for your kiss, no mountain I would not scale, no river I would not ford, no desert I would not cross.""He gestured widely, indicating the village of Wall below them, the night sky above them. In the constellation of Orion, low on the Eastern horizon, a star flashed and glittered and fell.""For a kiss, and the pledge of your hand,"" said Tristran, grandiloquently, ""I would bring you that fallen star.""He shivered. His coat was thin, and it was obvious he would not get his kiss, which he found puzzling. The manly heroes of the penny dreadfuls and shilling novels never had these problems getting kissed.""Go on, then,"" said Victoria. ""And if you do, I will.""""What?"" said Tristran.""If you bring me that star,"" said Victoria, ""the one that just fell, not another star, then I'll kiss you. Who knows what else I might do. There: now you need not go to Australia, nor to Africa, nor to far Cathay.""""What?"" said Tristran.And Victoria laughed at him, then, and took back her hand, and began to walk down the hill toward her father's farm.Tristran ran to catch her up. ""Do you mean it?"" he asked her.""I mean it as much as you mean all your fancy words of rubies and gold and opium,"" she replied. ""What is an opium?""""Something in cough mixture,"" said Tristran. ""Like eucalyptus.""""It does not sound particularly romantic,"" said Victoria Forester. ""Anyway, should you not be running off to retrieve my fallen star? It fell to the East, over there."" And she laughed again. ""Silly shop-boy. It is all you can do to ensure that we have the ingredients for rice pudding.""""And if I brought you the fallen star?"" asked Tristran lightly. ""What would you give me? A kiss? Your hand in marriage?""""Anything you desire,"" said Victoria, amused.""You swear it?"" asked Tristran.They were walking the last hundred yards now, up to the Foresters' farmhouse. The windows burned with lamplight, yellow and orange.""Of course,"" said Victoria, smiling.The track to the Foresters' farm was bare mud, trodden into mire by the feet of horses and cows and sheep and dogs. Tristran Thorn went down on his knees in the mud, heedless of his coat or his woolen trousers. ""Very well,"" he said.The wind blew from the east, then.""I shall leave you here, my lady,"" said Tristran Thorn. ""For I have urgent business, to the East."" He stood up, unmindful of the mud and mire clinging to his knees and coat, and he bowed to her, and then he doffed his bowler hat.Victoria Forester laughed at the skinny shop-boy, laughed long and loud and delightfully, and her tinkling laughter followed him back down the hill, and away.Tristran Thorn ran all the way home. Brambles snagged at his clothes as he ran and a branch knocked his hat from his head.He stumbled, breathless and torn, into the kitchen of the house on Westward Meadows.""Look at the state of you!"" said his mother. ""Indeed! I never did!""Tristran merely smiled at her.""Tristran?"" asked his father, who at five and thirty was still middling tall and still freckled, although there were more than a few silvering hairs in his nut-brown curls. ""Your mother spoke to you. Did you not hear her?""""I beg your pardon, Father, Mother,"" said Tristran, ""but I shall be leaving the village tonight. I may be gone for some time.""""Foolishness and silliness!"" said Daisy Thorn. ""I never heard such nonsense.""But Dunstan Thorn saw the look in his son's eyes. ""Let me talk to him,"" he said to his wife. She looked at him sharply, then she nodded. ""Very well,"" she said. ""But who's going to sew up the boy's coat? That's what I would like to know."" She bustled out of the kitchen.The kitchen fire fizzed in silver and glimmered green and violet. ""Where are you going?"" asked Dunstan.""East,"" said his son.East. His father nodded. There were two easts-east to the next county, through the forest, and East, the other side of the wall. Dunstan Thorn knew without asking to which his son was referring.""And will you be coming back?"" asked his father.Tristran grinned widely. ""Of course,"" he said.""Well,"" said his father. ""That's all right, then."" He scratched his nose. ""Have you given any thought to getting through the wall?""Tristran shook his head. ""I'm sure I can find a way,"" he said. ""If necessary, I'll fight my way past the guards.""His father sniffed. ""You'll do no such thing,"" he said. ""How would you like it if it was you was on duty, or me? I'll not see anyone hurt."" He scratched the side of his nose once more. ""Go and pack a bag, and kiss your mother good-bye, and I'll walk you down to the village.""Tristran packed a bag, and his mother brought him six red, ripe apples and a cottage loaf and a round of white farmhouse cheese, which he placed inside his bag. Mrs. Thorn would not look at Tristran. He kissed her cheek and bade her farewell. Then he walked into the village with his father.Tristran had stood his first watch on the wall when he was sixteen years old. He had only been given one instruction: That it was the task of the guards to prevent anyone from coming through the gap in the wall from the village, by any means possible. If it was not possible to prevent them, then the guards must raise the village for help.He wondered as they walked what his father had in mind.Perhaps the two of them together would overpower the guards. Perhaps his father would create some kind of distraction, and allow him to slip through... perhaps...By the time they walked through the village and arrived at the gap in the wall, Tristran had imagined every possibility, except the one which occurred.On wall duty that evening were Harold Crutchbeck and Mr. Bromios. Harold Crutchbeck was a husky young man several years older than Tristran, the miller's son. Mr. Bromios's hair was black, and curled, and his eyes were green, and his smile was white, and he smelled of grapes and of grape juice, of barley and of hops.Dunstan Thorn walked up to Mr. Bromios, and stood in front of him. He stamped his feet against the evening chill.""Evening, Mister Bromios. Evening, Harold,"" said Dunstan.""Evening, Mister Thorn,"" said Harold Crutchbeck.""Good evening, Dunstan,"" said Mr. Bromios. ""I trust you are well.""Dunstan allowed as that he was; and they spoke of the weather, and agreed that it would be bad for the farmers, and that, from the quantity of holly berries and yew berries already apparent, it would be a cold, hard winter.As he listened to them talking, Tristran was ready to burst with irritation and frustration, but he bit his tongue and said nothing.Finally, his father said, ""Mister Bromios, Harold, I believe you both know my son Tristran?"" Tristran raised his bowler hat to them, nervously.And then his father said something he did not understand.""I suppose you both know about where he came from,"" said Dunston Thorn.Mr. Bromios nodded, without speaking.Harold Crutchbeck said he had heard tales, although you never should mind the half of what you hear.""Well, it's true,"" said Dunstan. ""And now it's time for him to go back.""""There's a star..."" Tristran began to explain, but his father hushed him to silence.Mr. Bromios rubbed his chin, and ran a hand through his thatch of black curls. ""Very well,"" he said. He turned and spoke to Harold in a low voice, saying things Tristran could not hear.His father pressed something cold into his hand.""Go on with you, boy. Go, and bring back your star, and may God and all His angels go with you.""And Mr. Bromios and Harold Crutchbeck, the guards on the gate, stood aside to let him pass.Tristran walked through the gap, with the stone wall on each side of him, into the meadow on the other side of the wall.Turning, he looked back at the three men, framed in the gap, and wondered why they had allowed him through.Then, his bag swinging in one hand, the object his father had pushed into his hand in the other, Tristran Thorn set off up the gentle hill, toward the woods.As he walked, the chill of the night grew less, and once in the woods at the top of the hill Tristran was surprised to realize the moon was shining brightly down on him through a gap in the trees. He was surprised because the moon had set an hour before; and doubly surprised, because the moon that had set had been a slim, sharp silver crescent, and the moon that shone down on him now was a huge, golden harvest moon, full, and glowing, and deeply colored.The cold thing in his hand chimed once: a crystalline tinkling like the bells of a tiny glass cathedral. He opened his hand and held it up to the moonlight.It was a snowdrop, made all of glass.A warm wind stroked Tristran's face: it smelled like peppermint, and blackcurrant leaves, and red, ripe plums; and the enormity of what he had done descended on Tristran Thorn. He was walking into Faerie, in search of a fallen star, with no idea how he would find the star, nor how to keep himself safe and whole as he tried. He looked back and fancied that he could see the lights of Wall behind him, wavering and glimmering as if in a heat-haze, but still inviting.And he knew that if he turned around and went back, no one would think any less of him for it- not his father, nor his mother; and even Victoria Forester would likely as not merely smile at him the next time she saw him, and call him ""shop boy,"" and add that stars, once fallen, often proved difficult in the finding.He paused, then.He thought of Victoria's lips, and her grey eyes, and the sound of her laughter. He straightened his shoulders, placed the crystal snowdrop in the top buttonhole of his coat, now undone. And, too ignorant to be scared, too young to be awed, Tristran Thorn passed beyond the fields we know... and into Faerie.
ST_ch3	ST	Stardust	3	3322	18646	CHAPTER THREEIn Which We Encounter Several Other Persons, Many of the Them Still Alive, With an Interest in the Fat of the Fallen StarThe Stormhold had been carved out of the peak of Mount Huon by the first lord of Stormhold, who reigned at the end of the First Age and into the beginning of the Second. It had been expanded, improved upon, excavated and tunneled into by successive Masters of Stormhold, until the original mountain peak now raked the sky like the ornately carved tusk of some great, grey, granite beast. The Stormhold itself was perched high in the sky, where the thunder clouds gathered before they went down to the lower air, spilling rain and lightning and devastation upon the place beneath.The eighty-first Lord of Stormhold lay dying in his chamber, which was carved from the highest peak like a hole in a rotten tooth. There is still death in the lands beyond the fields we know.He summoned his children to his bedside and they came, the living and the dead of them, and they shivered in the cold granite halls. They gathered about his bed and waited respectfully, the living to his right side, the dead on his left.Four of his sons were dead: Secundus, Quintus, Quartus and Sextus, and they stood unmoving, grey figures, insubstantial and silent.Three of his sons remained alive: Primus, Tertius and Septimus. They stood, solidly, uncomfortably, on the right of the chamber, shifting from foot to foot, scratching their cheeks and noses, as if they were shamed by the silent repose of their dead brothers. They did not glance across the room toward their dead brothers, acting-as best they could-as if they and their father were the only ones in that cold room, where the windows were huge holes in the granite through which the cold winds blew. And whether this is because they could not see their dead brothers, or because, having murdered them (one apiece, save Septimus, who had killed both Quintus and Sextus, poisoning the former with a dish of spiced eels, and, rejecting artifice for efficiency and gravity, simply pushing Sextus off a precipice one night as they were admiring a lightning storm far below), they chose to ignore them, scared of guilt, or revelation, or ghosts, their father did not know.Privately, the eighty-first lord had hoped that by the time his end came upon him, six of the seven young lords at Stormhold would be dead, and but one still alive. That one would be the eighty-second Lord of Stormhold and Master of the High Crags; it was, after all, how he had attained his own title several hundred years before.But the youth of today were a pasty lot, with none of the get-up-and-go, none of the vigor and vim that he remembered from the days when he was young...Somebody was saying something. He forced himself to concentrate.""Father,"" repeated Primus in his deep boom of a voice. ""We are all here. What would you do with us?""The old man stared at him. With a ghastly wheezing he pulled a breath of the thin, chill air into his lungs, and then said, in high, cold tones, like the granite itself, ""I am dying. Soon my time will be done, and you will take my remains deep into the mountain, to the Hall of Ancestors, and you will place them-me-in the one-and-eightieth hollow you come to, which is to say, the first that is not occupied, and there you shall leave me. If you do not do this thing, you will each be cursed, and the tower of Stormhold shall tumble and fall.""His three living sons said nothing. A murmur ran through the four dead sons, though: regret, perhaps, that their remains had been gobbled up by eagles, or carried away by the fast rivers, tumbled down waterfalls and off to the sea, never to rest in the Hall of Ancestors.""Now. The matter of succession."" The lord's voice wheezed out of him, like the wind being squeezed from a pair of rotten bellows. His living sons raised their heads: Primus, the oldest, with white hairs in his thick brown beard, his nose aquiline, his eyes grey, looked expectant; Tertius, his beard red-and-golden, his eyes a tawny brown, looked wary; Septimus, his black beard still coming in, tall and crowlike, looked blank, as he always looked blank.""Primus. Go to the window.""Primus strode over to the opening in the rock wall and looked out.""What do you see?""""Nothing, sire. I see the evening sky above us, and clouds below us.""The old man shivered beneath the mountain-bear skin that covered him.""Tertius. Go to the window. What do you see?""""Nothing, Father. It is as Primus told you. The evening sky hangs above us, the color of a bruise, and clouds carpet the world beneath us, all grey and writhing.""The old man's eyes twisted in his face like the mad eyes of a bird of prey. ""Septimus. You. Window.""Septimus strolled to the window and stood beside, although not too close to, his two elder brothers.""And you? What do you see?""He looked out of the opening. The wind was bitter on his face, and it made his eyes sting and tear. One star glimmered, faintly, in the indigo heavens.""I see a star, Father.""""Ahh,"" wheezed the eighty-first lord. ""Bring me to the window."" His four dead sons looked at him sadly as his three living sons carried him to the window. The old man stood, or almost stood, leaning heavily on the broad shoulders of his children, staring into the leaden sky.His fingers, swollen-knuckled and twiglike, fumbled with the topaz that hung on a heavy silver chain about his neck. The chain parted like a cobweb in the old man's grip. He held the topaz out in his fist, the broken ends of silver chain dangling.The dead lords of Stormhold whispered amongst themselves, in the voices of the dead which sound like snow falling: the topaz was the Power of Stormhold. Who wore it would be Stormhold's master, as long as he was of the blood of Stormhold. To which of the surviving sons would the eighty-first lord give the stone?The living sons said nothing, but looked, respectively, expectant, wary, and blank (but it was a deceptive blankness, the blankness of a rock face that one only realizes cannot be climbed when one is halfway up, and there is no longer any way down).The old man pulled free of his sons, and stood straight and tall, then. He was, for a heartbeat, the lord of Stormhold who had defeated the Northern Goblins at the battle of Cragland's Head; who had fathered eight children-seven of them boys-on three wives; who had killed each of his four brothers in combat, before he was twenty years old, although his oldest brother had been almost five times his age and a mighty warrior of great renown. It was this man who held up the topaz and said four words in a long-dead tongue, words which hung on the air like the strokes of a huge bronze gong.Then he threw the stone into the air. The living brothers caught their breath, as the stone arced up over the clouds. It reached what they were certain must be the zenith of its curve, and then, defying all reason, it continued to rise into the air.Other stars glittered in the night sky, now.""To he who retrieves the stone, which is the Power of Stormhold, I leave my blessing, and the Mastership of Stormhold and all its dominions,"" said the eighty-first lord, his voice losing power as he spoke, until once again it was the creak of an old, old man, like the wind blowing through an abandoned house.The brothers, living and dead, stared at the stone. It fell upwards into the sky until it was lost to sight.""And should we capture eagles, and harness them, to drag us into the heavens?"" asked Tertius, puzzled and annoyed.His father said nothing. The last of the daylight faded, and the stars hung above them, uncountable in their glory.One star fell.Tertius thought, although he was not certain, that it was the first star of the evening, the one that his brother Septimus had remarked upon.The star tumbled, a streak of light, through the night sky, and it tumbled down somewhere to the south and west of them.""There,"" whispered the eighty-first lord, and he fell to the stone floor of his chamber, and he breathed no more.Primus scratched his beard, and looked down at the crumpled thing. ""I've half a mind,"" he said, ""to push the old bastard's corpse out of the window. What was all that idiocy about?""""Better not,"" said Tertius. ""We don't want to see Stormhold tumble and fall. Nor do we want a curse on our heads, for that matter. Better just place him in the Hall of Ancestors.""Primus picked his father's body up, and carried him back to the furs of his bed. ""We will tell the people he is dead,"" he said.The four dead brothers clustered with Septimus at the window.""What do you think he's thinking?"" asked Quintus of Sextus.""He's wondering where the stone fell, and how to reach it first,"" said Sextus, remembering his fall down the rocks and into eternity.""I damned well hope so,"" said the late eighty-first master of Stormhold to his four dead sons. But his three sons who were not yet dead heard nothing at all.A question like ""How big is Faerie?"" does not admit of a simple answer.Faerie, after all, is not one land, one principality or dominion. Maps of Faerie are unreliable, and may not be depended upon.We talk of the kings and queens of Faerie as we would speak of the kings and queens of England. But Faerie is bigger than England, as it is bigger than the world (for, since the dawn of time, each land that has been forced off the map by explorers and the brave going out and proving it wasn't there has taken refuge in Faerie; so it is now, by the time that we come to write of it, a most huge place indeed, containing every manner of landscape and terrain). Here, truly, there be Dragons. Also gryphons, wyverns, hippogriffs, basilisks, and hydras. There are all manner of more familiar animals as well, cats affectionate and aloof, dogs noble and cowardly, wolves and foxes, eagles and bears.In the middle of a wood so thick and so deep it was very nearly a forest was a small house, built of thatch and wood and daubed grey clay, which had a most foreboding aspect. A small, yellow bird in a cage sat on its perch outside the house. It did not sing, but sat mournfully silent, its feathers ruffled and wan. There was a door to the cottage, from which the once-white paint was peeling away.Inside, the cottage consisted of one room, undivided. Smoked meats and sausages hung from the rafters, along with a wizened crocodile carcass. A peat fire burned smokily in the large fireplace against one wall, and the smoke trickled out of the chimney far above. There were three blankets upon three raised beds-one large and old, the other two little more than truckle beds.There were cooking implements, and a large wooden cage, currently empty, in another corner. There were windows too filthy to see through, and over everything was a thick layer of oily dust.The only thing in the house that was clean was a mirror of black glass, as high as a tall man, as wide as a church door, which rested against one wall.The house belonged to three aged women. They took it in turns to sleep in the big bed, to make the supper, to set snares in the wood for small animals, to draw water up from the deep well behind the house.The three women spoke little.There were three other women in the little house. They were slim, and dark, and amused. The hall they inhabited was many times the size of the cottage; the floor was of onyx, and the pillars were of obsidian. There was a courtyard behind them, open to the sky, and stars hung in the night sky above.A fountain played in the courtyard, the water rolling and falling from a statue of a mermaid in ecstasy, her mouth wide open. Clean, black water gushed from her mouth into the pool below, shimmering and shaking the stars.The three women, and their hall, were in the black mirror. The three old women were the Lilim-the witch-queen- all alone in the woods.The three women in the mirror were also the Lilim: but whether they were the successors to the old women, or their shadow-selves, or whether only the peasant cottage in the woods was real, or if, somewhere, the Lilim lived in a black hall, with a fountain in the shape of a mermaid playing in the courtyard of stars, none knew for certain, and none but the Lilim could say.On this day, one crone came in from the woods, carrying a stoat, its throat a splash of red.She placed it on the dusty chopping board and took a sharp knife. She cut it around at the arms and legs and neck, then, with one filthy hand, she pulled the skin off the creature, as if pulling a child from its pyjamas, and she dropped the naked thing onto the wooden chopping block.""Entrails?"" she asked, in a quavering voice.The smallest, oldest, most tangle-headed of the women, rocking back and forth in a rocking chair, said, ""Might as well.""The first old woman picked up the stoat by the head, and sliced it from neck to groin. Its innards tumbled out onto the cutting board, red and purple and plum-colored, intestines and vital organs like wet jewels on the dusty wood.The woman screeched, ""Come quick! Come quick!""Then she pushed gently at the stoat-guts with her knife, and screeched once more.The crone in the rocking chair pulled herself to her feet. (In the mirror, a dark woman stretched and rose from her divan.) The last old woman, returning from the outhouse, scurried as fast as she could from the woods.""What?"" she said. ""What is it?""(In the mirror, a third young woman rejoined the other two. Her breasts were small and high, and her eyes were dark.)""Look,"" gestured the first old woman, pointing with her knife.Their eyes were the colorless grey of extreme age, and they squinted at the organs on the slab.""At last,"" said one of them, and ""About time,"" said another.""Which of us, then, to find it?"" asked the third.The three women closed their eyes, and three old hands stabbed into the stoat-guts on the board.An old hand opened. ""I've a kidney.""""I've his liver.""The third hand opened. It belonged to the oldest of the Lilim. ""I've his heart,"" she said, triumphantly.""How will you travel?""""In our old chariot, drawn by what I find at the crossroads.""""You'll be needing some years.""The oldest one nodded.The youngest, the one who had come in from the outhouse, walked, painfully slowly, over to a high and ramshackle chest of drawers, and bent over. She took a rusting iron box from the bottommost drawer, and carried it over to her sisters. It was tied around with three pieces of old string, each with a different knot in it. Each of the women unknotted her own piece of string, then the one who had carried the box opened the lid. Something glittered golden in the bottom of the box. ""Not much left,"" sighed the youngest of the Lilim, who had been old when the wood they lived in was still beneath the sea.""Then it's a good thing that we've found a new one, isn't it?"" said the oldest, tartly, and with that she thrust a clawed hand into the box. Something golden tried to avoid her hand, but she caught it, wiggling and glimmering, opened her mouth, and popped it inside.(In the mirror, three women stared out.) There was a shivering and a shuddering at the center of all things.(Now, two women stared from the black mirror.) In the cottage, two old women stared, envy and hope mixing in their faces, at a tall, handsome woman with black hair and dark eyes and red, red lips.""My,"" she said, ""but this place is filthy."" She strode to the bed. Beside it was a large wooden chest, covered by a faded tapestry. She twitched off the tapestry, and opened the chest, rummaging inside.""Here we go,"" she said, holding up a scarlet kirtle. She tossed it onto the bed, and pulled off the rags and tatters she had worn as an old woman.Her two sisters stared across at her naked body hungrily. ""When I return with her heart, there will be years aplenty for all of us,"" she said, eying her sisters' hairy chins and hollow eyes with disfavor. She slipped a scarlet bracelet onto her wrist, in the shape of a small snake with its tail between its jaws.""A star,"" said one of her sisters.""A star,"" echoed the second.""Exactly,"" said the witch-queen, putting a circlet of silver upon her head. ""The first in two hundred years. And I'll bring it back to us."" She licked her scarlet lips with a deep red tongue.""A fallen star,"" she said.It was night in the glade by the pool and the sky was bespattered with stars beyond counting.Fireflies glittered in the leaves of the elm trees and in the ferns and in the hazel bushes, flickering on and off like the lights of a strange and distant city. An otter splashed in the brook that fed the pool. A family of stoats wove and wound their way to the water to drink. A fieldmouse found a fallen hazelnut and began to bite into the hard shell of the nut with its sharp, ever-growing front teeth, not because it was hungry, but because it was a prince under an enchantment who could not regain his outer form until he chewed the Nut of Wisdom. But its excitement made it careless, and only the shadow that blotted out the moonlight warned it of the descent of a huge grey owl, who caught the mouse in its sharp talons and rose again into the night.The mouse dropped the nut, which fell into the brook and was carried away, to be swallowed by a salmon. The owl swallowed the mouse in just a couple of gulps, leaving just its tail trailing from her mouth, like a length of bootlace. Something snuffled and grunted as it pushed through the thicket-a badger, thought the owl (herself under a curse, and only able to resume her rightful shape if she consumed a mouse who had eaten the Nut of Wisdom), or perhaps a small bear.Leaves rustled, water rilled, and then the glade became filled with light shining down from above, a pure white light which grew brighter and brighter. The owl saw it reflected in the pool, a blazing, glaring thing of pure light, so bright that she took to the wing and flew to another part of the forest. The wild things looked about them in terror.First the light in the sky was no bigger than the moon, then it seemed larger, infinitely larger, and the whole grove trembled and quivered and every creature held its breath and the fireflies glowed brighter than they had ever glowed in their lives, each one convinced that this at last was love, but to no avail...And then-There was a cracking sound, sharp as a shot, and the light that had filled the grove was gone.Or almost gone. There was a dim glow pulsing from the middle of the hazel thicket, as if a tiny cloud of stars were glimmering there.And there was a voice, a high clear, female voice, which said, ""Ow,"" and then, very quietly, it said ""Fuck,"" and then it said ""Ow,"" once more.And then it said nothing at all, and there was silence in the glade.
ST_ch4	ST	Stardust	4	7993	45427	CHAPTER FOUR""Can I Get There by Candlelight?""October moved further away with every step Tristran took; he felt as if he were walking into summer. There was a path through the woods, with a high hedgerow to one side, and he followed the path. High above him the stars glittered and gleamed, and the harvest moon shone golden yellow, the color of ripe corn. In the moonlight he could see briar-roses in the hedge.He was becoming sleepy now. For a time he fought to stay awake, and then he took off his overcoat, and put down his bag-a large leather bag of the kind that, in twenty years' time, would become known as a Gladstone bag-and he laid his head on his bag, and covered himself with his coat.He stared up at the stars: and it seemed to him then that they were dancers, stately and graceful, performing a dance almost infinite in its complexity. He imagined he could see the very faces of the stars; pale, they were, and smiling gently, as if they had spent so much time above the world, watching the scrambling and the joy and the pain of the people below them, that they could not help being amused every time another little human believed itself the center of its world, as each of us does.And then it came to Tristran that he was dreaming, and he walked into his bedroom, which was also the schoolroom of the village of Wall: and Mrs. Cherry tapped the blackboard and bade them all be silent, and Tristran looked down at his slate to see what the lesson would be about, but he could not read what he had written there. Then Mrs. Cherry, who resembled his mother so much that Tristran found himself astonished he had never before realized that they were the same person, called upon Tristran to tell the class the dates of all the kings and queens of England...""'Scuse me,"" said a small and hairy voice in his ear, ""but would you mind dreamin' a bit quieter? Your dreams is spillin' over into my dreams, and if there's one thing I've never been doin' with, it's dates. William the Conker, ten sixty-six, that's as far as I go, and I'd swap that for a dancing mouse.""""Mm?"" said Tristran.""Keep it down,"" said the voice. ""If you don't mind.""""Sorry,"" said Tristran, and his dreams after that were of the dark.Breakfast,"" said a voice close to his ear. ""It's mushrumps, fried in butter, with wild garlic.""Tristran opened his eyes: daylight shone through the briar-rose hedge, dappling the grass in gold and green. Something smelled like heaven.A tin container was placed beside him.""Poor fare,"" said the voice. ""Country fare, it is. Nothing like the gentry are used to, but the likes of me treasures a fine mushrump.""Tristran blinked, and reached into the tin bowl and took out a large mushroom between finger and thumb. It was hot. He took a careful bite, felt the juices flood his mouth. It was the finest thing he had ever eaten and, after he had chewed and swallowed it, he said so.""That's kind of you,"" said the small figure who sat on the other side of a little fire which crackled and smoked in the morning air. ""Kind of you, I'm sure. But you know, and I know, that it's just fried field-mushrumps, and never a patch on nothing proper...""""Is there any more?"" asked Tristran, realizing just how hungry he was: sometimes a little food can do that to you.""Ah now, that's manners for you,"" said the little figure, who wore a large, floppy hat and a large, flappy overcoat. ""Is there more? he says, as if it were poached quail's eggs and smoked gazelle and truffles, not just a mushrump, what tastes more or less like something what's been dead for a week and a cat wouldn't touch. Manners.""""I really, truly would like another mushroom,"" said Tristran, ""if it's not too much trouble.""The little man-if man he was, which Tristran found rather unlikely-sighed mournfully, and reached into the pan sizzling on the fire, with his knife, and flicked two large mushrooms into Tristran's tin bowl.Tristran blew on them, then ate them with his fingers. ""Look at you,"" said the little hairy person, his voice a mixture of pride and gloom, ""eatin' those mushrumps as if you liked them, as if they wasn't sawdust and wormwood and rue in your mouth.""Tristran licked his fingers, and assured his benefactor that they had been the very finest mushrooms he had ever had the privilege of eating.""You says that now,"" said his host with gloomy relish, ""but you'll not be sayin' that in an hour's time. They'll undoubtedly disagree with you, like the fishwife who disagreed with her young man over a mermaid. And that could be heard from Garamond to Stormhold. Such language! It fair turned my ears blue, it did."" The little hairy personage sighed deeply. ""Talkin' about your guts,"" he said, ""I'm going to attend to mine behind that tree over there. Would you do me the signal honor of keepin' an eye on that there pack of mine? I'd be obliged.""""Of course,"" said Tristran, politely. The little hairy man vanished behind an oak tree; Tristran heard a few grunts, and then his new friend reappeared, saying, ""There. I knowed a man in Paphlagonia who'd swallow a live snake every morning, when he got up. He used to say, he was certain of one thing, that nothing worse would happen to him all day. 'Course they made him eat a bowlful of hairy centipedes before they hung him, so maybe that claim was a bit presumptive.""Tristran excused himself. He urinated against the side of the oak tree, next to which was a small mound of droppings, certainly not produced by any human being. They looked like deer pellets, or rabbit-droppings.""My name is Tristran Thorn,"" said Tristran, when he returned. His breakfast companion had packed up the morning's breakfast-fire, pans and all-and made it vanish into his pack.He removed his hat, pressed it to his chest, and looked up at Tristran. ""Charmed,"" he said. He tapped the side of his pack: on it was written: CHARMED, ENCHANTED, ENSORCEL-LED AND CONFUSTICATED. ""I used to be confusticated,"" he confided, ""but you know how these things go.""And with that he set off along the path. Tristran walked behind him. ""Hey! I say!"" called Tristran. ""Slow down, can't you?"" For despite the huge pack (which put Tristran in mind of Christian's burden in Pilgrim's Progress, a book from which Mrs. Cherry had read to them every Monday morning, telling them that, although it was written by a tinker, it was a fine book for all of that) the little man-Charmed? Was that his name?-was moving away from him as fast as a squirrel up a tree.The little creature hurried back down the path. ""Somethin' wrong?"" he asked.""I cannot keep up,"" confessed Tristran. ""You walk so confoundedly fast.""The little hairy man slowed his pace. ""Beg your puddin',"" he said, as Tristran stumbled after him. ""Bein' on me own so much, I gets used to settin' me own pace.""They walked side by side, in the golden-green light of the sun through the newly opened leaves. It was a quality of light Tristran had observed, unique to springtime. He wondered if they had left summer as far behind as October. From time to time Tristran would remark on a flash of color in a tree or bush, and the little hairy man would say something like, ""Kingfisher. Mr. Halcyon they used to call him. Pretty bird,"" or ""Purple hummingbird. Drinks nectar from flowers. Hovers,"" or ""Redcap. They'll keep their distance, but don't you go scrutinizin' 'em or looking for trouble, 'cos you'll find it with those buggers.""They sat beside a brook to eat their lunch. Tristran produced the cottage loaf, the ripe, red apples, and round of cheese-hard, tart and crumbly-that his mother had given him. And although the little man eyed them both suspiciously, he wolfed them down and licked the crumbs of bread and cheese from his fingers, and munched noisily on the apple. Then he filled a kettle from the brook, and boiled it up for tea.""Suppose you tell me what you're about?"" said the little hairy man as they sat on the ground and drank their tea.Tristran thought for some moments, and then he said, ""I come from the village of Wall, where there lives a young lady named Victoria Forester, who is without peer among women, and it is to her, and to her alone, that I have given my heart. Her face is-""""Usual complement of bits?"" asked the little creature. ""Eyes? Nose? Teeth? All the usual?""""Of course.""""Well then, you can skip that stuff,"" said the little hairy man. ""We'll take it all as said. So what damn-fool silly thing has this young lady got you a-doin' of?""Tristran put down his wooden cup of tea, and stood up, offended.""What,"" he asked, in what he was certain were lofty and scornful tones, ""would possibly make you imagine that my lady-love would have sent me on some foolish errand?""The little man stared up at him with eyes like beads of jet. ""Because that's the only reason a lad like you would be stupid enough to cross the border into Faerie. The only ones who ever come here from your lands are the minstrels, and the lovers, and the mad. And you don't look like much of a minstrel, and you're-pardon me saying so, lad, but it's true- ordinary as cheese-crumbs. So it's love, if you ask me.""""Because,"" announced Tristran, ""every lover is in his heart a madman, and in his head a minstrel.""""Really?"" said the little man, doubtfully. ""I'd never noticed. So there's some young lady. Has she sent you here to seek your fortune? That used to be very popular. You'd get young fellers wanderin' all over, looking for the hoard of gold that some poor wyrm or ogre had taken absolute centuries to accumulate.""""No. Not my fortune. It was more of a promise I made to this lady I mentioned. I... we were talking, and I was promising her things, and we saw this falling star, and I promised to bring it to her. And it fell..."" he waved an arm toward a mountain range somewhere in the general direction of the sunrise ""...over there.""The little hairy man scratched his chin. Or his muzzle; it might well have been his muzzle. ""You know what I would do?""""No,"" said Tristran, hope rising within him, ""what?""The little man wiped his nose. ""I'd tell her to go shove her face in the pig pen, and go out and find another one who'll kiss you without askin' for the earth. You're bound to find one. You can hardly throw half a brick back in the lands you come from without hittin' one.""""There are no other girls,"" said Tristran confidently.The little man sniffed, and they packed up their things and walked on together.""Did you mean it?"" said the little man. ""About the fallen star?""""Yes,"" said Tristran.""Well, I'd not mention it about if I were you,"" said the little man. ""There's those as would be unhealthily interested in such information. Better keep mum. But never lie.""""So what should I say?""""Well,"" he said, ""f'r example, if they ask where you've come from, you could say 'Behind me,' and if they asked where you're going, you'd say 'In front of me.' """"I see,"" said Tristran.The path they were walking became harder to discern. A cold breeze ruffled Tristran's hair, and he shivered. The path led them into a grey wood of thin, pale birch trees.""Do you think it will be far?"" asked Tristran. ""To the star?""""How many miles to Babylon?"" said the little man rhetorically. ""This wood wasn't here, last time I was by this way,"" he added.""How Many Miles to Babylon,"" recited Tristran, to himself, as they walked through the grey wood.""Three score miles and ten.Can I get there by candlelight?Yes, and back again.Yes, if your feet are nimble and light,You can get there by candlelight.""""That's the one,"" said the little hairy man, his head questing from side to side as if he were preoccupied, or a little nervous.""It's only a nursery rhyme,"" said Tristran.""Only a nursery...? Bless me, there's some on this side of the wall would give seven years' hard toil for that little cantrip. And back where you come from you mutter 'em to babes alongside of a 'Rock-a-Bye-Baby' or a 'Rub-a-Dub-Dub,' without a second thought... Are you chilled, lad?""""Now that you mention it, I am a bit cold, yes.""""Look around you. Can you see a path?""Tristran blinked. The grey wood soaked up light and color and distance. He had thought they were following a path, but now that he tried to see the path, it shimmered, and vanished, like an optical illusion. He had taken that tree, and that tree, and that rock as markers of the path... but there was no path, only the mirk, and the twilight, and the pale trees. ""Now we're for it,"" said the hairy man, in a small voice.""Should we run?"" Tristran removed his bowler hat, and held it in front of him.The little man shook his head. ""Not much point,"" he said. ""We've walked into the trap, and we'll still be in it even if we runs.""He walked over to the nearest tree, a tall, pale, birchlike tree trunk, and kicked it, hard. Some dry leaves fell, and then something white tumbled from the branches to the earth with a dry, whispering sound.Tristran walked over to it and looked down; it was the skeleton of a bird, clean and white and dry.The little man shivered. ""I could castle,"" he told Tristran, ""but there's no one I could castle with'd be any better off here than we are... There's no escape by flying, not judgin' by that thing."" He nudged the skeleton with one pawlike foot. ""And your sort of people never could learn to burrow-not that that'd do us much good...""""Perhaps we could arm ourselves,"" said Tristran.""Arm ourselves?""""Before they come.""""Before they come? Why-they're here, you puddenhead. It's the trees themselves. We're in a serewood.""""Serewood?""""It's me own fault-I should've been paying more attention to where we was goin'. Now you'll never get your star, and I'll never get my merchandise. One day some other poor bugger lost in the wood'll find our skellingtons picked clean as whistles and that'll be that.""Tristran stared about him. In the gloom it seemed that the trees were crowding about more thickly, although he had seen nothing actually move. He wondered if the little man were being foolish, or imagining things.Something stung his left hand. He slapped at it, expecting to see an insect. He looked down to see a pale yellow leaf. It fell to the ground with a rustle. On the back of his hand, a veining of red, wet blood welled up. The wood whispered about them.""Is there anything we can do?"" Tristran asked.""Nothing I can think of. If only we knew where the true path was... even a serewood couldn't destroy the true path. Just hide it from us, lure us off of it..."" The little man shrugged, and sighed.Tristran reached his hand up and rubbed his forehead. ""I... I do know where the path is,"" he said. He pointed. ""It's down that way.""The little man's bead-black eyes glittered. ""Are you sure?""""Yes, sir. Through that copse and up a little way to the right. That's where the path is.""""How do you know?"" asked the man.""I know"" replied Tristran.""Right. Come on!"" And the little man took his burden and ran, slowly enough that Tristran, his leather bag swinging and banging against his legs, his heart pounding, his breath coming in gasps, was able to keep up.""No! Not that way. Over to the left!"" shouted Tristran. Branches and thorns ripped and tore at his clothes. They ran on in silence.The trees seemed to have arranged themselves into a wall. Leaves fell around them in flurries, stinging and smarting when they touched Tristran's skin, cutting and slicing at his clothes. He clambered up the hill, swiping at the leaves with his free hand, swatting at the twigs and branches with his bag.The silence was broken by something wailing. It was the little hairy man. He had stopped dead where he stood, and, his head thrown back, had begun to howl at the sky.""Buck up,"" said Tristran. ""We're nearly there."" He grasped the little hairy man's free hand in his own larger hand, and pulled him forward.And then they were standing on the true path: a swath of green sward running through the grey wood. ""Are we safe here?"" asked Tristran, panting, and looking about apprehensively.""We're safe, as long as we stay on the path,"" said the little hairy man, and he put down his burden, sat down on the grass of the path and stared at the trees about them.The pale trees shook, although no wind blew, and it seemed to Tristran that they shook in anger.His companion had begun to shudder, his hairy fingers raking and stroking the green grass. Then he looked up at Tristran. ""I don't suppose you have such a thing as a bottle of something spirituous upon you? Or perchance a pot of hot, sweet tea?""""No,"" said Tristran. ""'fraid not.""The little man sniffed, and fumbled at the lock of his huge package. ""Turn round,"" he said to Tristran. ""No peekin'.""Tristran turned away.There was a rummaging, scuffling noise. Then the sound of a lock clicking shut, and then, ""You can turn around, if you like."" The little man was holding an enamel bottle. He was tugging, vainly, at the stopper.""Um. Would you like me to help you with that?"" Tristran hoped the little hairy man would not be offended by his request. He should not have worried; his companion thrust the bottle into his hands.""Here go,"" he said. ""You've got the fingers for it.""Tristran tugged and pulled out the stopper of the bottle. He could smell something intoxicating, like honey mixed with wood smoke and cloves. He passed the bottle back to the little man.""It's a crime to drink something as rare and good as this out of the bottle,"" said the little hairy man. He untied the little wooden cup from his belt, and, trembling, poured a small amount of an amber-colored liquid into it. He sniffed it, then sipped it, then he smiled, with small, sharp teeth.""Aaaahhhh. That's better.""He passed the cup to Tristran.""Sip it slowly,"" he said. ""It's worth a king's ransom, this bottle. It cost me two large blue-white diamonds, a mechanical bluebird which sang, and a dragon's scale.""Tristran sipped the drink. It warmed him down to his toes and made him feel like his head was filled with tiny bubbles.""Good, eh?""Tristran nodded.""Too good for the likes of you and me, I'm afraid. Still. It hits the spot in times of trouble, of which this is certainly one. Let's get out of this wood,"" said the little hairy man. ""Which way, though...?""""That way,"" said Tristran, pointing to their left.The little man stoppered and pocketed the little bottle, shouldered his pack, and the two of them walked together down the green path through the grey wood.After several hours, the white trees began to thin, and then they were through the serewood and walking between two low rough-stone walls, along a high bank. When Tristran looked back the way they had come there was no sign of any wood at all; the way behind them was purple-headed, heathery hills.""We can stop here,"" said his companion. ""There's stuff we needs to talk about. Sit down.""He put down his enormous bag, and climbed on top of it, so he was looking down at Tristran, who sat on a rock beside the road. ""There's something here I'm not properly gettin'. Now, tell me. Where are you from?""""Wall,"" said Tristran. ""I told you.""""Who's your father and mother?""""My father's name is Dunstan Thorn. My mother is Daisy Thorn.""""Mmm. Dunstan Thorn... Mm. I met your father once. He put me up for the night. Not a bad chap, although he doesn't half go on a bit while a fellow's trying to get a little kip."" He scratched his muzzle. ""Still doesn't explain... there isn't anythin' unusual in your family, is there?""""My sister, Louisa, can wiggle her ears.""The little hairy man wiggled his own large, hairy ears, dismissively. ""No, that's not it,"" he said. ""I was thinkin' more of a grandmother who was a famous enchantress, or an uncle who was a prominent warlock, or a brace of fairies somewhere in the family tree.""""None that I know of,"" admitted Tristran.The little man changed his tack. ""Where's the village of Wall?"" he asked. Tristran pointed. ""Where are the Debatable Hills?"" Tristran pointed once more, without hesitation. ""Where's the Catavarian Isles?"" Tristran pointed to the southwest. He had not known there were Debatable Hills, or Catavarian Isles until the little man had mentioned them, but he was as certain in himself of their location as he was of the whereabouts of his own left foot or the nose on his face.""Hmm. Now thens. Do you know where His Vastness the Freemartin Muskish is?""Tristran shook his head.""D'you know where His Vastness the Freemartin Muskish's Transluminary Citadel is?""Tristran pointed, with certainty.""And what of Paris? The one in France?""Tristran thought for a moment. ""Well, if Wall's over there, I suppose that Paris must be sort of in the same sort of direction, mustn't it.""""Let's see,"" said the little hairy man, talking to himself as much as to Tristran. ""You can find places in Faerie, but not in your world, save for Wall, and that's a boundary. You can't find people... but... tell me, lad, can you find this star you're lookin' for?""Tristran pointed, immediately. ""It's that way,"" he said.""Hmm. That's good. But it still doesn't explain nuffink. You hungry?""""A bit. And I'm tattered and torn,"" said Tristran, fingering the huge holes in his trousers, and in his coat, where the branches and the thorns had seized at him, and the leaves had cut at him as he ran. ""And look at my boots...""""What's in your bag?""Tristran opened his Gladstone bag. ""Apples. Cheese. Half a cottage loaf. And a pot of fishpaste. My penknife. I've got a change of underwear, and a couple of pairs of woolen socks. I suppose I should have brought more clothes...""""Keep the fishpaste,"" said his traveling companion, and he rapidly divided the remaining food into two equal piles.""You done me a good turn,"" he said, munching a crisp apple, ""and I doesn't forget something like that. First we'll get your clothes took care of, and then we'll send you off after your star. Yus?""""That's extremely kind of you,"" said Tristran, nervously, slicing his cheese onto his crust of bread.""Right,"" said the little hairy man. ""Let's find you a blanket.""At dawn three lords of Stormhold rode down the craggy mountain road, in a coach pulled by six black horses. The horses wore bobbing black plumes, the coach was fresh painted in black, and each of the lords of Stormhold was dressed in mourning.In the case of Primus, this took the shape of a long, black, monkish robe; Tertius was dressed in the sober costume of a merchant in mourning, while Septimus wore a black doublet and hose, a black hat with a black feather in it, and looked for all the world like a foppish assassin from a minor Elizabethan historical play.The lords of Stormhold eyed each other, one cautious, one wary, one blank. They said nothing: had alliances been possible, Tertius might have sided with Primus against Septimus. But there were no alliances that could be made.The carriage clattered and shook.Once, it stopped, for each of the three lords to relieve himself. Then it clattered on down the hilly road. Together, the three lords of Stormhold had placed their father's remains in the Hall of Ancestors. Their dead brothers had watched them from the doors of the hall, but had said nothing.Toward evening, the coachman called out, ""Nottaway!"" and he reined his team outside a tumbledown inn, built against what resembled the ruins of a giant's cottage.The three lords of Stormhold got out of the coach, and stretched their cramped legs. Faces peered at them through the bottle-glass windows of the inn.The innkeeper, who was a choleric gnome of poor disposition, looked out of the door. ""We'll need beds aired, and a pot of mutton stew on the fire,"" he called.""How many beds to be aired?"" asked Letitia the chambermaid, from the stairwell.""Three,"" said the gnome. ""I'll wager they'll have their coachman sleep with the horses.""""Three indeed,"" whispered Tilly, the pot-girl, to Lacey, the ostler, ""when anyone could see a full seven of those fine gentlemen standing in the road.""But when the lords of Stormhold entered there were but three of them, and they announced that their coachman would sleep in the stables.Dinner was mutton stew, and bread loaves so hot and fresh they exhaled steam as they were cracked open, and each of the lords took an unopened bottle of the finest Baragundian wine (for none of the lords would share a bottle with his fellows, nor even permit the wine to be poured from the bottle into a goblet). This scandalized the gnome, who was of the opinion-not, however, uttered in the hearing of his guests- that the wine should be permitted to breathe.Their coachman ate his bowl of stew, and drank two pots of ale, and went to sleep in the stables. The three brothers went to their respective rooms and barred the doors.Tertius had slipped a silver coin to Letitia the chambermaid when she had brought him the warming-pan for his bed, so he was not surprised at all when, shortly before midnight, there came a tap-tapping on his door.She wore a one-piece white chemise, and curtsied to him as he opened the door, and smiled, shyly. She held a bottle of wine in her hand.He locked the door behind him, and led her to the bed, where, having first made her remove her chemise, and having examined her face and body by candlelight, and having kissed her on the forehead, lips, nipples, navel and toes, and having extinguished the candle, he made love to her, without speaking, in the pale moonlight.After some time, he grunted, and was still.""There, lovey, was that good, now?"" asked Letitia.""Yes,"" said Tertius, warily, as if her words guarded some trap. ""It was.""""Would you be wanting another turn, before I leave?""In reply, Tertius pointed between his legs. Letitia giggled. ""We can have him upstanding again in a twinkling,"" she said.And she pulled out the cork from the bottle of wine she had carried in, and had placed beside the bed, and passed it to Tertius.He grinned at her, and gulped down some wine, then pulled her to him.""I bet that feels good,"" she said to him. ""Now, lovey, this time let me show you how I like it... why, whatever is the matter?"" For Lord Tertius of Stormhold was writhing back and forth on the bed, his eyes wide, his breathing labored.""That wine?"" he gasped. ""Where did you get it?""""Your brother,"" said Letty. ""I met him on the stairs. He told me it was a fine restorative and stiffener, and it would provide us with a night we should never forget.""""And so it has,"" breathed Tertius, and he twitched, once, twice, three times, and then was stiff. And very still.Tertius heard Letitia begin to scream, as if from a very long way away. He was conscious of four familiar presences, standing with him in the shadows beside the wall.""She was very beautiful,"" whispered Secundus, and Letitia thought she heard the curtains rustle.""Septimus is most crafty,"" said Quintus. ""That was the self-same preparation of baneberries he slipped into my dish of eels,"" and Letitia thought she heard the wind, howling down from the mountain crags.She opened the door to the household, woken by her screams, and a search ensued. Lord Septimus, however, was nowhere to be found, and one of the black stallions was gone from the stable (in which the coachman slept and snored and could not be wakened).Lord Primus was in a foul mood when he arose the next morning.He declined to have Letitia put to death, stating she was as much a victim of Septimus's craft as Tertius had been, but ordered that she accompany Tertius's body back to the castle of Stormhold.He left her one black horse to carry the body, and a pouch of silver coins. It was enough to pay a villager of Nottaway to travel with her-to ensure no wolves made off with the horse or his brother's remains-and to pay off the coachman when finally he awoke.And then, alone in the coach, pulled by a team of four coal-black stallions, Lord Primus left the village of Nottaway, in significantly worse temper than he had arrived there.Brevis arrived at the crossroads tugging at a rope. The rope was attached to a bearded, horned, evil-eyed billy goat, which Brevis was taking to market to sell.That morning, Brevis's mother had placed a single radish upon the table in front of him and had said, ""Brevis, son. This radish was all I was able to pull from the ground today. All our crops have failed, and all our food has gone. We've nothing to sell but the billy goat. So I want you to halter the goat, and take him to the market, and sell him to a farmer. And with the coins you get for the goat-and you'll take nothing less than a florin, mark you-buy a hen, and buy corn, and turnips; and perhaps we shall not starve.""So Brevis had chewed his radish, which was woody, and peppery to the tongue, and spent the rest of the morning chasing the goat about its pen, sustaining a bruise to the rib and a bite to the thigh in the process, and, eventually, and with the help of a passing tinker, he had subdued the goat enough to have it haltered, and, leaving his mother to bandage the tinker's goat-inflicted injuries, he dragged the billy goat toward the market.Sometimes the goat would take it into his head to charge on ahead, and Brevis would be dragged behind him, the heels of his boots grinding into the dried mud of the roadway, until the goat would decide-suddenly and without warning, for no reason Brevis was able to discern-to stop. Then Brevis would pick himself up and return to dragging the beast.He reached the crossroads on the edge of the wood, sweaty and hungry and bruised, pulling an uncooperative goat. There was a tall woman standing at the crossroads. A circlet of silver sat in the crimson headpiece that surrounded her dark hair, and her dress was as scarlet as her lips.""What do they call you, boy?"" she asked, in a voice like musky brown honey.""They call me Brevis, ma'am,"" said Brevis, observing something strange behind the woman. It was a small cart, but there was nothing harnessed between the shafts. He wondered how it had ever got there.""Brevis,"" she purred. ""Such a nice name. Would you like to sell me your goat, Brevis-boy?""Brevis hesitated. ""My mother told me I was to take the goat to the market,"" he said, ""and to sell him for a hen, and some corn, and some turnips, and to bring her home the change.""""How much did your mother tell you to take for the goat?"" asked the woman in the scarlet kirtle.""Nothing less than a florin,"" he said.She smiled, and held up one hand. Something glinted yellow. ""Why, I will give you this golden guinea,"" she said, ""enough to buy a coopful of hens and a hundred bushels of turnips.""The boy's mouth hung open.""Do we have a deal?""The boy nodded, and thrust out the hand which held the billy goat's rope halter. ""Here,"" was all he could say, visions of limitless wealth and turnips beyond counting tumbling through his head.The lady took the rope. Then she touched one finger to the goat's forehead, between its yellow eyes, and let go of the rope.Brevis expected the billy goat to bolt for the woods or down one of the roads, but it stayed where it was, as if frozen into position. Brevis held out his hand for the golden guinea.The woman looked at him then, examining him from the soles of his muddy feet, to his sweaty, cropped hair, and once more she smiled.""You know,"" she said, ""I think that a matched pair would be so much more impressive than just one. Don't you?""Brevis did not know what she was talking about, and opened his mouth to tell her so. But just then she reached out one long finger, and touched the bridge of his nose, between his eyes, and he found he could not say anything at all.She snapped her fingers, and Brevis and the billy goat hastened to stand between the shafts of her cart; and Brevis was surprised to notice that he was walking on four legs, and he seemed to be no taller than the animal beside him.The witch-woman cracked her whip, and her cart jolted off down the muddy road, drawn by a matched pair of horned white billy goats.The little hairy man had taken Tristran's ripped coat and trousers and waistcoat, and, leaving him covered by a blanket, had walked into the village which nestled in the valley between three heather-covered hills.Tristran sat under the blanket, in the warm evening, and waited.Lights flickered in the hawthorn bush behind him. He thought they were glow-worms or fireflies, but, on closer inspection, he perceived they were tiny people, flickering and flitting from branch to branch.He coughed, politely. A score of tiny eyes stared down at him. Several of the little creatures vanished. Others retreated high into the hawthorn bush, while a handful, braver than the others, flitted toward him.They began to laugh, in high, bell-tinkling tones, pointing at Tristran, in his broken boots and blanket, and underclothes, and bowler hat. Tristran blushed red, and pulled the blanket about himself.One of the little folk sang:Hankety panketyBoy in a blanket, he'sOff on a goose-chase toLook for a starIncontrovertiblyJourneys through FaerieStrip off the blanket toSee who you are.And another one sang:Tristran ThornTristran ThornDoes not know why he was bornAnd a foolish oath has swornTrews and coat and shirt are tornSo he sits here all forlornSoon to face his true love's scornWistranBistranTristranThorn.""Be off with you, you silly things,"" said Tristran, his face burning, and, having nothing else to hand, he threw his bowler hat at them.Thus it was, that when the little hairy man arrived back from the village of Revelry (although why it was so called no man alive could say, for it was a gloomy, somber place, and had been for time out of mind) he found Tristran sitting glumly beside a hawthorn bush, wrapped in a blanket, and bewailing the loss of his hat.""They said cruel things about my true love,"" said Tristran. ""Miss Victoria Forester. How dare they?""""The little folk dare anything,"" said his friend. ""And they talks a lot of nonsense. But they talks an awful lot of sense, as well. You listen to 'em at your peril, and you ignore 'em at your peril, too.""""They said I was soon to face my true love's scorn.""""Did they, indeed?"" The little hairy man was laying a variety of clothes out upon the grass. Even in the moonlight, Tristran could see that the clothes he was laying out bore no manner of resemblance to the clothes that Tristran had removed earlier in the day.In the village of Wall, men wore brown, and grey, and black; and even the reddest neckerchief worn by the ruddiest of farmers was soon faded by the sun and the rain to a more mannerly color. Tristran looked at the crimson and canary and russet cloth, at clothes which looked more like the costumes of traveling players or the contents of his cousin Joan's charades chest, and said, ""My clothes?""""These are your clothes now,"" said the little hairy man, proudly. ""I traded 'em. This stuffs better quality-see, it won't rip and tear as easy-and it's neither tattered nor torn, and withal, you'll not stick out so much as a stranger. This is what people wears hereabouts, y'see.""Tristran contemplated making the rest of his quest wrapped in a blanket, like a savage aboriginal from one of his schoolbooks. Then, with a sigh, he took off his boots, and let the blanket fall to the grass, and, with the little hairy man as his guide (""No, no, laddie, those go over that. Mercy, what do they teach them nowadays?"") he was soon dressed in his fine new clothes.The new boots fit him better than the old ones ever had.They certainly were fine new clothes. While clothes do not, as the saying would sometimes have it, make the man, and fine feathers do not make fine birds, sometimes they can add a certain spice to a recipe. And Tristran Thorn in crimson and canary was not the same man that Tristran Thorn in his overcoat and Sunday suit had been. There was a swagger to his steps, a jauntiness to his movements, that had not been there before. His chin went up instead of down, and there was a glint in his eye that he had not possessed when he had worn a bowler hat.By the time they had eaten the meal the little hairy man had brought back with him from Revelry-which consisted of smoked trout, a bowl of fresh shelled peas, several small raisin-cakes, and a bottle of small beer-Tristran felt quite at home with his new garb.""Now then,"" said the little hairy man. ""You've saved my life, laddie, back there in the serewood, and your father, he done me a good turn back before you was born, and let it never be said that I'm a cove what doesn't pay his debts-""Tristran began to mutter something about how his friend had already done more than enough for him, but the little hairy man ignored him and continued. ""-so I was a-ponderin': you know where your star is, don't you?""Tristran pointed, without hesitation, to the dark horizon.""Now then, how far is it, to your star? D'you know that?""Tristran had not given the matter any thought, hitherto, but he found himself saying, ""A man could walk, only stopping to sleep, while the moon waxed and waned above him a half a dozen times, crossing treacherous mountains and burning deserts, before he reached the place where the star has fallen.""It did not sound like the kind of thing that he would say at all, and he blinked with surprise.""As I thought,"" said the little hairy man, approaching his burden, and bending over it, so Tristran could not see how it unlocked. ""And it's not like you're the only one'll be lookin' for it. You remember what I told you before?""""About digging a hole to bury my dung in?""""Not that.""""About telling no one my true name, nor my destination?""""Nor yet that.""""Then what?""""How many miles to Babylon?"" recited the man.""Oh. Yes. That.""""Can I get there by candlelight? There and back again. Only it's the candle-wax, you see. Most candles won't do it. This one took a lot of findin'."" And he pulled out a candle-stub the size of a crabapple, and handed it to Tristran.Tristran could see nothing in any way out of the ordinary about the candle-stub. It was a wax candle, not tallow, and it was much used and melted. The wick was charred and black.""What do I do with it?"" he asked.""All in good time,"" said the little hairy man, and took something else from his pack. ""Take this, too. You'll need it.""It glittered in the moonlight. Tristran took it; the little man's gift seemed to be a thin silver chain, with a loop at each end. It was cold and slippery to the touch. ""What is it?""""The usual. Cat's breath and fish-scales and moonlight on a mill-pond, melted and smithied and forged by the dwarfs. You'll be needin' it to bring your star back with you.""""I will?""""Oh, yes.""Tristran let the chain fall into his palm: it felt like quicksilver. ""Where do I keep it? I have no pockets in these confounded clothes.""""Wrap it around your wrist until you need it. Like that. There you go. But you've a pocket in your tunic, under there, see?""Tristran found the concealed pocket. Above it there was a small buttonhole, and in the buttonhole he placed the snowdrop, the glass flower that his father had given him as a luck token when he had left Wall. He wondered whether it was in fact bringing him luck, and if it were, was it good luck or bad?Tristran stood up. He held his leather bag tightly in his hand.""Now then,"" said the little hairy man. ""This is what you got to do. Take up the candle in your right hand; I'll light it for you. And then, walk to your star. You'll use the chain to bring it back here. There's not much wick left on the candle, so you'd best be snappy about it, and step lively- any daw-dlin' and you'll regret it. Feet be nimble and light, yes?""""I... I suppose so, yes,"" said Tristran.He stood expectantly. The little hairy man passed a hand over the candle, which lit with a flame yellow above and blue below. There was a gust of wind, but the flame did not flicker even the slightest bit.Tristran took the candle in his hand, and he began to walk forward. The candlelight illuminated the world: every tree and bush and blade of grass.With Tristran's next step he was standing beside a lake, and the candlelight shone brightly on the water; and then he was walking through the mountains, through lonely crags, where the candlelight was reflected in the eyes of the creatures of the high snows; and then he was walking through the clouds, which, while not entirely substantial, still supported his weight in comfort; and then, holding tightly to his candle, he was underground, and the candlelight glinted back at him from the wet cave walls; now he was in the mountains once more; and then he was on a road through wild forest, and he glimpsed a chariot being pulled by two goats, being driven by a woman in a red dress who looked, for the glimpse he got of her, the way Boadicea was drawn in his history books; and another step and he was in a leafy glen, and he could hear the chuckle of water as it splashed and sang its way into a small brook.He took another step, but he was still in the glen. There were high ferns, and elm trees, and foxgloves in abundance, and the moon had set in the sky. He held up the candle, looking for a fallen star, a rock, perhaps, or a jewel, but he saw nothing.He heard something, though, under the babbling of the brook: a sniffling, and a swallowing. The sound of someone trying not to cry.""Hello?"" said Tristran.The sniffling stopped. But Tristran was certain he could see a light beneath a hazel tree, and he walked toward it.""Excuse me,"" he said, hoping to pacify whoever was sitting beneath the hazel tree, and praying that it was not more of the little people who had stolen his hat. ""I'm looking for a star.""In reply, a clod of wet earth flew out from under the tree, hitting Tristran on the side of the face. It stung a little, and fragments of earth fell down his collar and under his clothes.""I won't hurt you,"" he said, loudly.This time, as another clod of earth came hurtling toward him, he ducked out of the way, and it smashed into an elm tree behind him. He walked forward.""Go away,"" said a voice, all raw and gulping, as if it had just been crying, ""just go away and leave me alone.""She was sprawled, awkwardly, beneath the hazel tree, and she gazed up at Tristran with a scowl of complete unfriendliness. She hefted another clod of mud at him, menacingly, but did not throw it.Her eyes were red and raw. Her hair was so fair it was almost white, her dress was of blue silk which shimmered in the candlelight. She glittered as she sat there. ""Please don't throw any more mud at me,"" pleaded Tristran. ""Look. I didn't mean to disturb you. It's just there's a star fallen somewhere around here, and I have to get it back before the candle burns out.""""I broke my leg,"" said the young lady.""I'm sorry, of course,"" said Tristran. ""But the star.""""I broke my leg,"" she told him sadly, ""when I fell."" And with that, she heaved her lump of mud at him. Glittering dust fell from her arm, as it moved.The clod of mud hit Tristran in the chest.""Go away,"" she sobbed, burying her face in her arms. ""Go away and leave me alone.""""You're the star,"" said Tristran, comprehension dawning.""And you're a clodpoll,"" said the girl, bitterly, ""and a ninny, a numbskull, a lackwit and a coxcomb!""""Yes,"" said Tristran. ""I suppose I am at that."" And with that he unwound one end of the silver chain, and slipped it around the girl's slim wrist. He felt the loop of the chain tighten about his own.She stared up at him, bitterly. ""What,"" she asked, in a voice that was suddenly beyond outrage, beyond hate, ""do you think you are doing?""""Taking you home with me,"" said Tristran. ""I made an oath.""And at that the candle-stub guttered, violently, the last of the wick afloat in the pool of wax. For a moment the candle flame flared high, illuminating the glen, and the girl, and the chain, unbreakable, that ran from her wrist to his.Then the candle went out.Tristran stared at the star-at the girl-and, with all his might, managed to say nothing at all.Can I get there by candlelight? he thought. There, and back again. But the candlelight was gone, and the village of Wall was six months' hard travel from here.""I just want you to know,"" said the girl, coldly, ""that whoever you are, and whatever you intend with me, I shall give you no aid of any kind, nor shall I assist you, and I shall do whatever is in my power to frustrate your plans and devices."" And then she added, with feeling, ""Idiot.""""Mm,"" said Tristran. ""Can you walk?""""No,"" she said. ""My leg's broken. Are you deaf, as well as stupid?""""Do your kind sleep?"" he asked her.""Of course. But not at night. At night, we shine.""""Well,"" he said, ""I'm going to try to get some sleep. I can't think of anything else to do. It's been a long day for me, what with everything. And maybe you should try to sleep, too. We've got a long way to go.""The sky was beginning to lighten. Tristran put his head on his leather bag in the glen, and did his best to ignore the insults and imprecations that came his way from the girl in the blue dress at the end of the chain.He wondered what the little hairy man would do, when Tristran did not return.He wondered what Victoria Forester was doing at the moment, and decided that she was probably asleep, in her bed, in her bedroom, in her father's farmhouse.He wondered whether six months was a long walk, and what they would eat on the way.He wondered what stars ate...And then he was asleep.""Dunderhead. Bumpkin. Dolt,"" said the star.And then she sighed, and made herself as comfortable as she could, under the circumstances. The pain from her leg was dull but continual. She tested the chain about her wrist, but it was tight and fast, and she could neither slip from it nor break it. ""Cretinous, verminous oaf,"" she muttered. And then she, too, slept.
ST_ch5	ST	Stardust	5	7323	40012	CHAPTER FIVEIn Which There is Much Fighting for the CrownIn the morning's bright light the young lady seemed more human and less ethereal. She had said nothing since Tristran had woken.He took his knife and cut a fallen treebranch into a Y-shaped crutch while she sat beneath a sycamore tree and glared at him and glowered at him and scowled at him from her place on the ground. He peeled the bark from a green branch and wound it around the upper fork of the Y.They had had no breakfast yet, and Tristran was ravenous; his stomach rumbled as he worked. The star had said nothing about being hungry. Then again, she had done nothing at all but look at him, first reproachfully, and then with undisguised hatred.He pulled the bark tight, then looped it under itself and tugged on it once more. ""This is honestly nothing personal,"" he said, to the woman and to the grove. With the full sunlight shining down she scarcely glittered at all, save for where the darkest shadows touched her.The star ran one pale forefinger up and down the silver chain that went between them, tracing the line of it about her slim wrist, and made no reply.""I did it for love,"" he continued. ""And you really are my only hope. Her name-that is, the name of my love-is Victoria. Victoria Forester. And she is the prettiest, wisest, sweetest girl in the whole wide world.""The girl broke her silence with a snort of derision. ""And this wise, sweet creature sent you here to torture me?"" she said.""Well, not exactly. You see, she promised me anything I desired-be it her hand in marriage or her lips to kiss-were I to bring her the star that we saw fall the night before last. I had thought,"" he confessed, ""that a fallen star would probably look like a diamond or a rock. I certainly wasn't expecting a lady.""""So, having found a lady, could you not have come to her aid, or left her alone? Why drag her into your foolishness?""""Love,"" he explained.She looked at him with eyes the blue of the sky. ""I hope you choke on it,"" she said, flatly.""I won't,"" said Tristran, with more confidence and good cheer than he actually felt. ""Here. Try this."" He passed her the crutch, and, reaching down, tried to help her to her feet. His hands tingled, not unpleasantly, where his skin touched hers. She sat on the ground like a tree stump, making no effort to get up.""I told you,"" she said, ""that I would do everything in my power to frustrate your plans and devices."" She looked around the grove. ""How very bland this world does look by day. And how dull.""""Just put your weight on me, and the rest on the crutch,"" he said. ""You'll have to move sometime."" He tugged on the chain and, reluctantly, the star began to get to her feet, leaning first against Tristran, and then, as if proximity to him disgusted her, on the crutch.She gasped, then, in a hard intake of breath, and tumbled to the grass, where she lay with her face contorted, making small noises of pain. Tristran knelt down beside her. ""What's wrong?"" he asked.Her blue eyes flashed, but they were swimming with tears. ""My leg. I can't stand on it. It must really be broken."" Her skin had gone as white as a cloud, and she was shivering.""I'm sorry,"" said Tristran, uselessly. ""I can make you a splint. I've done it for sheep. It'll be all right."" He squeezed her hand, and then he went to the brook, and dipped his handkerchief in it, and gave it to the star to wipe her forehead.He split more fallen wood with his knife. Then he removed his jerkin, and took off his shirt, which he proceeded to tear into strips which he used to bind the sticks, as firmly as he could, about her injured leg. The star made no sounds while he did this, although, when he pulled the last knot tight, he thought he heard her whimper to herself.""Really,"" he told her, ""we ought to get you to a proper doctor. I'm not a surgeon or anything.""""No?"" she said dryly. ""You astonish me.""He let her rest for a little, in the sun. And then he said, ""Better try again, I suppose,"" and he raised her to her feet.They left the glade at a hobble, the star leaning heavily on her crutch and on Tristran's arm, wincing at every step. And every time she winced or flinched Tristran felt guilty and awkward, but he calmed himself by thinking of Victoria Forester's grey eyes. They followed a deer path through the hazel-wood, while Tristran-who had decided that the right thing to do was to make conversation with the star-asked how long she had been a star, whether it was enjoyable to be a star and whether all stars were women, and informed her that he had always supposed stars to be, as Mrs. Cherry had taught them, flaming balls of burning gas many hundreds of miles across, just like the sun only further away.To all of these questions and statements she made no answer.""So why did you fall?"" he asked. ""Did you trip over something?""She stopped moving, and turned, and stared at him, as if she were examining something quite unpleasant a very long way away.""I did not trip,"" she said at length. ""I was hit. By this."" She reached into her dress, and pulled out a large yellowish stone, which dangled from two lengths of silver chain. ""There's a bruise on my side where it hit me and knocked me from the sky. And now I am obligated to carry it about with me.""""Why?""She seemed as if she were about to answer, and then she shook her head, and her lips closed, and she said nothing at all. A stream rilled and splashed to their right, keeping pace with them. The noonday sun was overhead, and Tristran found himself getting increasingly hungry. He took the heel of the dry loaf from his bag, moistened it in the stream, and shared it out, half and half.The star inspected the wet bread with disdain, and did not put it in her mouth.""You'll starve,"" warned Tristran.She said nothing, just raised her chin a little higher.They continued through the woodland, making slow progress. They were laboring up a deer path on the side of a hill, which led them over fallen trees, and which had now become so steep it threatened to tumble the stumbling star and her captor down to the bottom. ""Is there not an easier path?"" asked the star, at length. ""Some kind of road, or a level clearing?""And once the question was asked, Tristran knew the answer. ""There is a road half a mile that way,"" he told her, pointing, ""and a clearing over there, beyond that thicket,"" he said, turning to motion in another direction.""You knew that?""""Yes. No. Well, I only knew it once you asked me.""""Let us make for the clearing,"" she said, and they pushed through the thicket as best they could. It still took them the better part of an hour to reach the clearing, but the ground, when they got there, was as level and flat as a playing field. The space seemed to have been cleared with a purpose, but what that purpose was Tristran could not imagine.In the center of the glade, on the grass some distance from them, was an ornate golden crown, which glittered in the afternoon sunlight. It was studded with red and blue stones: rubies and sapphires, thought Tristran. He was about to walk over to the crown when the star touched his arm and said, ""Wait. Do you hear drums?""He realized that he did: a low, throbbing beat, coming from all around them, near at hand and far away, which echoed through the hills. And then there came a loud crashing noise from the trees at the far side of the clearing, and a high, wordless screaming. Into the glade came a huge white horse, its flanks gashed and bloody. It charged into the middle of the clearing, and then it turned, and lowered its head, and faced its pursuer-which bounded into the clearing with a growl that made Tristran's flesh prickle. It was a lion, but it looked little enough like the lion Tristran had seen at a fair in the next village, which had been a mangy, toothless, rheumy thing. This lion was huge, the color of sand in the late afternoon. It entered the clearing at a run, and then it stopped, and snarled at the white horse.The horse looked terrified. Its mane was matted with sweat and blood, and its eyes were wild. Also, Tristran realized, it had a long, ivory horn jutting from the center of its forehead. It reared up on its hind legs, whinnying and snorting, and one sharp, unshod hoof connected with the lion's shoulder, causing the lion to howl like a huge, scalded cat, and to spring backwards. Then, keeping its distance, the lion circled the wary unicorn, its golden eyes at all times fixed upon the sharp horn that was always turned toward it.""Stop them,"" whispered the star. ""They will kill each other.""The lion growled at the unicorn. It began as a soft growl, like distant thunder, and finished as a roar that shook the trees and the rocks of the valley and the sky. Then the lion sprang and the unicorn plunged, and the glade was filled with gold and silver and red, for the lion was on the unicorn's back, claws gashing deeply into its flanks, mouth at its neck, and the unicorn was wailing and bucking and throwing itself onto its back in an effort to dislodge the great cat, flailing uselessly with its hooves and its horn in an effort to reach its tormentor.""Please, do something. The lion will kill him,"" pleaded the girl, urgently.Tristran would have explained to her that all he could possibly hope for if he approached the raging beasts was to be skewered, and kicked, and clawed, and eaten; and he would further have explained that, should he somehow survive approaching them, there was still nothing that he could do, having with him not even the pail of water which had been the traditional method of breaking up animal fights in Wall. But by the time all these thoughts had gone through his head, Tristran was already standing in the center of the clearing, an arm's length from the beasts. The scent of the lion was deep, animal, terrifying, and Tristran was close enough to see the beseeching expression in the unicorn's black eyes...The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown, thought Tristran to himself, remembering the old nursery rhyme.The Lion beat the Unicorn all about the town.He beat him onceHe beat him twiceWith all his might and mainHe beat him three times overHis power to maintainAnd with that, he picked up the crown from the grass; it was as heavy and as soft as lead. He walked toward the animals, talking to the lion as he had talked to the ill-tempered rams and agitated ewes in his father's fields, saying ""Here, now... Easy... Here's your crown...""The lion shook the unicorn in its jaws, like a cat worrying a woolen scarf, and darted a look of pure puzzlement at Tristran.""Hullo,"" said Tristran. There were burrs and leaves in the lion's mane. He held the heavy crown out toward the great beast. ""You won. Let the unicorn go."" And he took a step closer. Then he reached out both trembling hands, and placed the crown upon the lion's head.The lion clambered off the prone body of the unicorn and began to pad, silently, about the clearing, its head raised high. It reached the edge of the wood, where it paused for several minutes to lick its wounds with its red, red tongue, and then, purring like an earthquake, the lion slipped away into the forest.The star hobbled over to the injured unicorn and lowered herself to the grass, awkwardly, her broken leg splayed out by her side. She stroked its head. ""Poor, poor creature,"" she said. It opened its dark eyes and stared at her, and then it laid its head upon her lap, and it closed its eyes once more.That evening, Tristran ate the last of the hard bread for his supper, and the star ate nothing at all. She had insisted they wait beside the unicorn, and Tristran had not the heart to refuse her.The clearing was dark, now. The sky above them was filled with the twinkling of a thousand stars. The star-woman glittered too, as if she had been brushed by the Milky Way; while the unicorn glowed gently in the darkness, like a moon seen through clouds. Tristran lay beside the huge bulk of the unicorn, feeling its warmth radiating out into the night. The star was lying on the other side of the beast. It sounded almost as if she were murmuring a song to the unicorn; Tristran wished that he could hear her properly. The fragments of melody he could make out were strange and tantalizing, but she sang so quietly he could hear next to nothing at all.His fingers touched the chain that bound them: cold as snow it was, and tenuous as moonlight on a millpond or the glint of light on a trout's silver scales as it rises at dusk to feed.And soon he slept.The witch-queen drove her chariot down a forest path, lashing the flanks of the twin white billy goats with a I whip when they flagged. She had observed the small cooking fire burning beside the path from almost half a mile back, and she knew from the color of the flames that it was the fire of one of her people, for witch-fires burn with certain unusual hues. So she reined in her goats when she reached the brightly painted gypsy caravan, and the cooking fire, and the iron-haired old woman who sat beside the fire, tending to the spit over the flames on which a hare was roasting. Fat dripped from the hare's open gut, hissing and sizzling in the fire, which gave off the twin aromas of cooking meat and of wood smoke.A multicolored bird sat by the driver's seat at the front of the caravan, on a wooden perch. It raised its feathers and called out in alarm when it saw the witch-queen, but it was chained to its perch and could not leave.""Before you says anything,"" said the grey-haired woman, ""I should tell ye that I'm just a poor old flower-seller, a harmless old biddy who's never done nothing to no one, and that the sight of a grand and terrifying lady such as yourself fills me with dread and fear.""""I will not harm you,"" said the witch-queen.The harridan screwed her eyes to slits, and looked the lady in the red kirtle up and down. ""That's what you says,"" she said. ""But how am I to know that it's so, a sweet old dear like me, who's all a-tremble from her toes to her water? You might be planning to rob me in the night, or worse."" And she poked the fire with a stick, so it leapt up. The smell of the cooked meat hung on the still evening air.""I swear,"" said the lady in the scarlet kirtle, ""that, by the rules and constraints of the Sisterhood to which you and I belong, by the puissance of the Lilim, and by my lips and breasts and maidenhood, that I mean you no harm, and shall treat you as if you were my own guest.""""That's good enough for me, dearie-ducks,"" said the old woman, her face breaking into a smile. ""Come and sit down. Supper'll be cooked in two shakes of a lamb's tail.""""With good will,"" said the lady in the red kirtle.The goats snuffled and munched at the grass and the leaves beside the chariot, eyeing with distaste the tethered mules that pulled the caravan. ""Fine goats,"" said the harridan. The witch-queen inclined her head and smiled modestly. The firelight glinted on the little scarlet snake wrapped as a bracelet about her wrist.The harridan went on, ""Now, my dear, my old eyes aren't what once they were by any means, but would I be correct in supposing that one of those fine fellows started life walking on two legs, not four?""""Such things have been heard of,"" admitted the witch-queen. ""That splendid bird of yours, for example.""""That bird gave away one of the prizes of my stock of items for sale, gave it away to a good-fornothing, nearly twenty years ago. And afterward, the trouble she put me through scarcely bears considering. So these days, she stays a bird, unless there's work that needs doing, or the flower-stall to run; and if I could find a good strong servant, not afraid of a little hard work, why then she would stay a bird forever.""The bird chirruped sadly upon her perch.""They call me Mistress Semele,"" said the harridan.They called you Ditchwater Sal, when you were a young chit of a thing, thought the witch-queen, but she did not say this aloud. ""You may call me Morwanneg,"" said the witch instead. It was, she reflected, almost a joke (for Morwanneg means wave of the sea, and her true name was long since drowned and lost beneath the cold ocean).Mistress Semele got to her feet and made her way into the interior of the caravan, emerging with two painted wooden bowls, two wooden-handled knives, and a small pot of herbs, dried and flaked to a green powder. ""I was going to be eating with fingers on a plate of fresh leaves,"" she said, handing a bowl to the lady in the scarlet kirtle. The bowl had a sunflower painted upon it, under a layer of dust. ""But I thought, well, how often does I get such fine company? So nothing but the best. Heads or tails?""""Let it be your choice,"" said her guest.""Head, then, for you, with the luscious eyes and brains, and the crispy-crunchy ears of him. And I'll have the rump, with nothing but dull meat to nibble."" She lifted the spit off the fire as she spoke, and, using both knives so fast they seemed little more than a glitter of blades, she parted the carcass and sliced the meat from the bones, and dealt it out, fairly equitably, into each bowl. She passed the pot of herbs to her guest. ""There's no salt, my dear, but if you shake this on it will do the trick. A little basil, a little mountain thyme-my own receipt.""The witch-queen took her portion of roasted hare, and one of the knives, and sprinkled a little of the herbs onto the dish. She speared a bite on the point of the knife and ate it with relish, while her hostess toyed with her own portion, then blew on it fastidiously, steam coming from the crisp brown meat.""How is it?"" asked the old woman.""Perfectly palatable,"" said her guest, honestly.""It is the herbs make it so fine,"" explained the harridan.""I can taste the basil and the thyme,"" said the guest, ""but there is another taste I find harder to place.""""Ah,"" said Madame Semele, and she nibbled a sliver of the meat.""It is certainly a most uncommon taste.""""That it is. It's a herb that grows only in Garamond, on an island in the midst of a wide lake. It is most pleasant with all manner of meats and fishes, and it reminds me in flavor a little of the leaves of fennel, with but a hint of nutmeg. The flowers of it are a most attractive shade of orange. It is good for wind and the ague, and it is, in addition, a gentle soporific, which has the curious property of causing one who tastes of it to speak nothing but the truth for several hours.""The lady in the scarlet kirtle dropped her wooden bowl onto the ground. ""Limbus grass?"" she said. ""You dared to feed me limbus grass.""""That's how it would seem, dearie,"" and the old woman cackled and hooted with delight. ""So, tell me now, Mistress Morwanneg, if that's your name, where are you a-going-of, in your fine chariot? And why do you remind me so of someone I knew once...? And Madame Semele forgets nothing and no one.""""I am on my way to find a star,"" said the witch-queen, ""which fell in the great woods on the other side of Mount Belly. And when I find her, I shall take my great knife and cut out her heart, while she lives, and while her heart is her own. For the heart of a living star is a sovereign remedy against all the snares of age and time. My sisters wait for me to return.""Madame Semele hooted and hugged herself, swaying back and forth, bony fingers clutching her sides. ""The heart of a star, is it? Hee! Hee! Such a prize it will make for me. I shall taste enough of it that my youth will come back, and my hair turn from grey to golden, and my dugs swell and soften and become firm and high. Then I shall take all the heart that's left to the Great Market at Wall. Hee!""""You shall not do this thing,"" said her guest, very quietly. ""No? You are my guest, my dear. You swore your oath. You've tasted of my food. According to the laws of our sisterhood, there is nothing you can do to harm me.""""Oh, there are so many things I could do to harm you, Ditchwater Sal, but I shall simply point out that one who has eaten limbus grass can speak nothing but the truth for several hours afterward; and one more thing..."" Distant lightning flickered in her words as she spoke, and the forest was hushed, as if every leaf and every tree were listening intently to what she said. ""This I say: you have stolen knowledge you did not earn, but it shall not profit you. For you shall be unable to see the star, unable to perceive it, unable to touch it, to taste it, to find it, to kill it. Even if another were to cut out its heart and give it to you, you would not know it, never know what you had in your hand. This I say. These are my words, and they are a true-speaking. And know this also: I swore, by the compact of the Sisterhood, that I would do you no harm. Had I not so sworn I would change you into a black-beetle, and I would pull your legs off, one by one, and leave you for the birds to find, for putting me to this indignity.""Madame Semele's eyes opened wide with fright, and she stared over the flames of the fire at her guest. ""Who are you?"" she said.""When you knew me last,"" said the woman in the scarlet kirtle, ""I ruled with my sisters in Carnadine, before it was lost.""""Vow? But you are dead, long dead.""""They have said that the Lilim were dead before now, but they have always lied. The squirrel has not yet found the acorn that will grow into the oak that will be cut to form the cradle of the babe who will grow to slay me.""Silver flashes glittered and flared in the flames as she spoke.""So it is you. And you have your youth back."" Madame Semele sighed. ""And now I, too, shall be young again.""The lady in the scarlet kirtle stood up then, and placed the bowl which had contained her portion of hare into the fire. ""You shall be nothing of the kind,"" she said. ""Did you not hear me? A moment after I leave, you shall forget that ever you saw me. You shall forget all of this, even my curse, although the knowledge of it shall vex and irritate you, like an itch in a limb long since amputated. And may you treat your guests with more grace and respect in the future.""The wooden bowl burst into flames then, a huge gout of flame which singed the leaves of the oak tree far above them. Madame Semele knocked the blackened bowl from the fire with a stick, and she stamped it out in the long grass. ""Whatever could have possessed me to drop the bowl into the fire?"" she exclaimed aloud. ""And look, one of my nice knives, all burned up and ruined. Whatever was I a-thinking of?""There came no answer. From further down the road came the drumming beats of something that might have been the hooves of goats, racing on into the night. Madame Semele shook her head, as if to clear it of dust and cobwebs. ""I'm getting old,"" she said to the multicolored bird who sat on its perch by the driver's seat, and who had observed everything and forgotten nothing. ""Getting old. And there's no doing anything about that."" The bird shifted uncomfortably on the perch.A red squirrel quested, hesitating a little, into the firelight. It picked up an acorn, held it for a moment in its handlike front paws, as if it were praying. Then it ran away-to bury the acorn, and to forget it.Scaithe's Ebb is a small seaport town built on granite, a town of chandlers and carpenters and sailmakers; of old sailors with missing fingers and limbs who have opened their own grog houses or spend their days in them, what is left of their hair still tarred into long queues, though the stubble on their chins has long since dusted to white. There are no whores in Scaithe's Ebb, or none that consider themselves as such, although there have always been many women who, if pressed, would describe themselves as much-married, with one husband on this ship here every six months, and another husband on that ship, back in port for a month or so every nine months.The mathematics of the thing have always kept most folk satisfied; and if ever it disappoints and a man returns to his wife while one of her other husbands is still in occupancy, why, then there is a fight-and the grog shops to comfort the loser. The sailors do not mind the arrangement, for they know that this way there will, at the least, be one person who, at the last, will notice when they do not come back from the sea, and will mourn their loss; and their wives content themselves with the certain knowledge that their husbands are also unfaithful, for there is no competing with the sea in a man's affections, since she is both mother and mistress, and she will wash his corpse also, in time to come, wash it to coral and ivory and pearls.So it was to Scaithe's Ebb that Lord Primus of Stormhold came one night, all dressed in black with a beard as thick and serious as one of the storks' nests in the town's chimneys. He came in a carriage drawn by four black horses and he took a room in the Seaman's Rest on Crook Street.He was considered most peculiar in his needs and requests, for he brought his own food and drink into his rooms, and kept it locked in a wooden chest, which he would only open to take himself an apple, or a wedge of cheese, or a cup of pepper-wine. His was the topmost room in the Seaman's Rest, a high and spindly building, built on a rocky outcrop to facilitate smuggling.He bribed a number of the local street urchins to report to him the moment they saw any fellow they did not know come to town, by land or sea; in particular, they were to look for a very tall, angular, dark-haired fellow, with a thin hungry face, and blank eyes.""Primus is certainly learning caution,"" said Secundus to his five other dead brothers.""Well, you know what they say,"" whispered Quintus, in the wistful tones of the dead, which sounded, on that day, like the lapping of distant waves upon the shingle, ""a man who is tired of looking over his shoulder for Septimus is tired of life.""In the mornings, Primus would talk to the sea captains with ships in Scaithe's Ebb, buying them grog liberally, but neither drinking nor eating with them. In the afternoon he would inspect the ships in the docks.Soon the gossips of Scaithe's Ebb (and there were many) had the gist and juice of it all: the bearded gentleman was to be taking ship to the East. And this tale was soon chased by another, that he would be sailing out on the Heart of a Dream under Captain Yann, a black-trimmed ship with its decks painted crimson red, of more or less savory reputation (by which I mean that it was generally held that she kept her piracies for distant waters) and this would be happening as soon as he gave the word.""Good master!"" said a street urchin to Lord Primus. ""There's a man in town, come by land. He lodges with Mistress Pettier. He is thin and crowlike, and I saw him in the Ocean's Roar, buying grog for every man in the room. He says he is a distressed seafaring man, seeking a berth.""Primus patted the boy's filthy head and handed him a coin. Then he returned to his preparations, and that afternoon it was announced that the Heart of a Dream would leave harbor in three short days.The day before the Heart of a Dream was to set sail, Primus was seen to sell his coach and four horses to the stableman on Wardle Street, after which he walked down to the quay, dispensing small coins to the urchins. He entered his cabin in the Heart of a Dream and gave strict orders that none was to disturb him, for any reason, good or bad, until they were at least a week out of port.That evening an unfortunate accident befell an able seaman who had crewed the rigging on the Heart of a Dream. He fell, when drunk, on the slippery cobblestones of Revenue Street, and broke his hip. Luckily there was a replacement at the ready: the very sailor with whom he had been drinking that evening, and to whom the injured man had been persuaded to demonstrate a particularly complicated hornpipe step on the wet cobbles. And this sailor, tall, dark and crowlike, marked his ship's papers with a circle that night and was on deck at dawn when the ship sailed out of the harbor, in the morning mist. The Heart of a Dream sailed east.Lord Primus of Stormhold, his beard freshly shaven, watched it sail from the cliff top until it was lost to view. Then he walked down to Wardle Street, where he returned the stableman's money and something more besides, and he rode off on the coast road toward the west, in a dark coach pulled by four black horses.It was an obvious solution. After all, the unicorn had been ambling hugely behind them for most of the morning, occasionally nudging the star's shoulder with its big forehead. The wounds on its dappled flanks, which had blossomed like red flowers under the lion's claws the day before, were now dried to brown and scabbed over.The star limped and hobbled and stumbled, and Tristran walked beside her, cold chain binding wrist to wrist.On the one hand, Tristran felt there was something almost sacrilegious about the idea of riding the unicorn: it was not a horse, did not subscribe to any of the ancient pacts between Man and Horse. There was a wildness in its black eyes, and a twisting spring to its step which was dangerous and untamed. On the other hand, Tristran had begun to feel, in a way that he could not articulate, that the unicorn cared about the star, and wished to help her. So he said, ""Look, I know all that stuff about frustrating my plans every step of the way, but if the unicorn is willing, perhaps it would carry you on its back, for a little way.""The star said nothing.""Well?""She shrugged.Tristran turned to the unicorn, stared into its pool-black eyes. ""Can you understand me?"" he asked. It said nothing. He had hoped it would nod its head or stamp a hoof, like a trained horse he had once seen on the village green when he was younger. But it simply stared. ""Will you carry the lady? Please?""The beast said not a word, nor did it nod or stamp. But it walked to the star, and it knelt down at her feet.Tristran helped the star onto the unicorn's back. She grasped its tangled mane with both hands and sat sidesaddle upon it, her broken leg sticking out. And that was how they traveled for some hours.Tristran walked along beside them, carrying her crutch over his shoulder, with his bag dangling from the end. He found it as hard to travel with the star riding the unicorn as it had been before. Then he had been forced to walk slowly, trying to keep pace with the star's limping hobble-now he was hurrying to keep up with the unicorn, nervous lest the unicorn should get too far ahead and the chain that linked them both should pull the star from the beast's back. His stomach rumbled, as he walked. He was painfully aware how hungry he was; soon Tristran began to think of himself as nothing more than hunger, thinly surrounded by flesh, and, as fast as he could, walking, walking...He stumbled and knew that he was going to fall.""Please, stop,"" he gasped.The unicorn slowed, and stopped. The star looked down at him. Then she made a face, and shook her head. ""You had better come up here, too,"" she said. ""If the unicorn will let you. Otherwise you'll just faint or something, and drag me onto the ground with you. And we need to go somewhere so that you can get food.""Tristran nodded, gratefully.The unicorn appeared to offer no opposition, waiting, passively, so Tristran attempted to clamber up onto it. It was like climbing a sheer wall, and as fruitless. Eventually Tristran led the animal over to a beech tree that had been uprooted several years before by a storm, or a high wind, or an irritable giant, and, holding his bag and the star's crutch, he scrambled up the roots onto the trunk, and from there onto the back of the unicorn.""There is a village on the other side of that hill,"" said Tristran. ""I expect that we can find something to eat when we get there."" He patted the unicorn's flanks with his free hand. The beast began to walk. Tristran moved his hand to the star's waist, to steady himself. He could feel the silken texture of her thin dress, and beneath that, the thick chain of the topaz about her waist.Riding a unicorn was not like riding a horse: it did not move like a horse; it was a wilder ride, and a stranger one. The unicorn waited until Tristran and the star were comfortable upon its back, and then, slowly and easily, it began to put on speed.The trees surged and leapt past them. The star leaned forward, her fingers tangled into the unicorn's mane; Tristran-his hunger forgotten in his fear-gripped the sides of the unicorn with his knees, and simply prayed that he would not be knocked to the ground by a stray branch. Soon he found he was beginning to enjoy the experience. There is something about riding a unicorn, for those people who still can, which is unlike any other experience: exhilarating and intoxicating and fine.The sun was setting when they reached the outskirts of the village. In a rolling meadow, beneath an oak tree, the unicorn came to a skittish halt and would go no further. Tristran dismounted, and landed with a bump on the grass of the meadow. His rump felt sore, but, with the star looking down at him, uncomplaining, he dared not rub it.""Are you hungry?"" he asked the star.She said nothing.""Look,"" he said, ""I'm starving. Perfectly famished. I don't know if you-if stars-eat, or what they eat. But I won't have you starving yourself."" He looked up at her, questioning. She stared down at him, first impassively, then, in a trice, her blue eyes filled with tears. She raised a hand to her face and wiped away the tears, leaving a smudge of mud on her cheeks.""We eat only darkness,"" she said, ""and we drink only light. So I'm nuh-not hungry. I'm lonely and scared and cold and muh-miserable and cuh-captured but I'm nuh-not hungry.""""Don't cry,"" said Tristran. ""Look, I'll go into the village and get some food. You just wait here. The unicorn will protect you, if anyone comes."" He reached up and gently lifted her down from the unicorn's back. The unicorn shook its mane, then began to crop the grass of the meadow, contentedly.The star sniffed, ""Wait here?"" she asked, holding up the chain that joined them.""Oh,"" said Tristran. ""Give me your hand.""She reached her hand out to him. He fumbled with the chain to undo it, but it would not undo. ""Hmm,"" said Tristran. He tugged at the chain around his own wrist, but it, too, held fast. ""It looks,"" he said, ""as if I'm as tied to you as you are to me.""The star threw her hair back, closed her eyes, and sighed deeply. And then, opening her eyes, once again self-possessed, she said, ""Perhaps there's a magic word or something.""""I don't know any magic words,"" said Tristran. He held the chain up. It glittered red and purple in the light of the setting sun. ""Please?"" he said. There was a ripple in the fabric of the chain, and he slid his hand out of it.""Here you go,"" he said, passing the star the other end of the chain that had bound her. ""I'll try not to be too long. And if any of the fair folk sing their silly songs at you, for heaven's sake, don't throw your crutch at them. They'll only steal it.""""I won't,"" she said.""I'll have to trust you, on your honor as a star, not to run away,"" he said.She touched her splinted leg. ""I will do no running for quite some time,"" she said, pointedly. And with that Tristran had to content himself.He walked the last half a mile into the village. It had no inn, being far off the beaten track for travelers, but the portly old woman who explained this to him then insisted he accompany her to her cottage, where she pressed upon him a wooden bowlful of barley porridge with carrots in it, and a mug of small beer. He exchanged his cambric handkerchief for a bottle of elderflower cordial, a round of green cheese and a number of unfamiliar fruits: they were soft and fuzzy, like apricots, but were the purple-blue of grapes, and they smelled a little like ripe pears; also the woman gave him a small bale of hay, for the unicorn.He walked back to the meadow where he had left them, munching on a piece of the fruit, which was juicy, and chewy and quite sweet. He wondered if the star would like to try one, whether she would like it if she did. He hoped that she would be pleased with what he had brought her.At first, Tristran thought that he must have made a mistake, and that he had lost his way in the moonlight. No: that was the same oak tree, the one beneath which the star had been sitting.""Hello?"" he called. Glow-worms and fireflies glittered green and yellow in the hedgerows and in the branches of trees. There came no reply, and Tristran felt a sick, stupid feeling in the pit of his stomach. ""Hello?"" he called. He stopped calling, then, because there was no one to answer.He dropped the bale of hay, and then he kicked it.She was to the southwest of him, moving faster than he could walk. He followed after her in the bright moonlight. Inside, he felt numbed and foolish; stung by a pang of guilt and shame and regret. He should not have loosed her chain, he should have tied it to a tree; he should have forced the star to go with him into the village. This went through his head as he walked; but another voice spoke to him also, pointing out that if he had not unchained her then, he would have done it sometime soon, and she would have run from him then.He wondered if he would ever see the star again, and he stumbled over roots as the way led him between old trees, into the deep woods. The moonlight slowly vanished beneath the thick canopy of leaves, and after stumbling vainly in the dark for a short while, he laid himself down beneath a tree, rested his head on his bag, and closed his eyes, and felt sorry for himself until he fell asleep.On a rocky mountain pass, on the southernmost slopes of Mount Belly, the witch-queen reined in her goat-drawn chariot and stopped and sniffed the chilly air.The myriad stars hung cold in the sky above her.Her red, red lips curved up into a smile of such beauty, such brilliance, such pure and perfect happiness that it would have frozen your blood in your veins to have seen it. ""There,"" she said. ""She is coming to me.""And the wind of the mountain pass howled about her triumphantly, as if in answer.Primus sat beside the embers of his fire and he shivered beneath his thick black robe. One of the black stallions, waking or dreaming, whinnied and snorted, and then rested once more. Primus's face felt strangely cold; he missed his thick beard. With a stick he pushed a clay ball from the embers. He spat on his hands, then he split open the hot clay and smelled the sweet flesh of the hedgehog, which had cooked, slowly, in the embers, as he had slept.He ate his breakfast meticulously, spitting the tiny bones into the fire circle once he had chewed the meat from them.He washed the hedgehog down with a lump of hard cheese and a slightly vinegary white wine.Once he had eaten, he wiped his hands upon his robe and then he cast the runes to find the topaz stone which conferred the lordship of the crag towns and the vast estates of the Stormhold.He cast them, then he stared, puzzled, at the small, square, red granite tiles. He picked them up once more, shook them in his long-fingered hands, dropped them onto the ground and stared at them again. Then Primus spat into the embers, which hissed lazily. He swept the tiles up and dropped them into the pouch at his belt.""It is moving faster, further,"" said Primus to himself.He pissed on the embers of the fire, for he was in wild country, and there were bandits and hobgoblins and worse in those lands, and he had no desire to alert them to his presence. Then, he hitched the horses to the carriage and climbed into the driver's seat, and drove them toward the forest, to the west, and to the mountain range beyond.The girl held tight to the unicorn's neck as it tumbled headlong through the dark forest.There was no moonlight between the trees, but the unicorn glimmered and shone with pale light, like the moon, while the girl herself glittered and glowed as if she trailed a dust of lights. And, as she passed through the trees, it might have appeared to a distant observer that she seemed to twinkle, on and off and off and on, like a tiny star.
ST_ch6	ST	Stardust	6	3911	21331	CHAPTER SIXWhat the Tree SaidTristran Thorn was dreaming.He was in an apple tree, staring through a window at Victoria Forester, who was getting undressed. As she removed her dress, revealing a healthy expanse of petticoat, Tristran felt the branch begin to give way beneath his feet, and then he was tumbling down through the air in the moonlight...He was falling into the moon.And the moon was talking to him: Please, whispered the moon, in a voice that reminded him a little of his mother's, protect her. Protect my child. They mean her harm. I have done all I can. And the moon would have told him more, and perhaps she did, but the moon became the glimmer of moonlight on water far below him, and then he became aware of a small spider walking across his face, and of a crick in his neck, and he raised a hand and brushed the spider carefully from his cheek, and the morning sun was in his eyes And the world was gold and green.""You were dreaming,"" said a young woman's voice from somewhere above him. The voice was gentle, and oddly accented. He could hear leaves rustle in the copper beech tree overhead.""Yes,"" he said, to whoever was in the tree, ""I was dreaming.""""I had a dream last night, too,"" said the voice. ""In my dream, I looked up and I could see the whole forest, and something huge was moving through it. And it got closer, and closer, and I knew what it was."" She stopped talking abruptly.""What was it?"" asked Tristran.""Everything,"" she said. ""It was Pan. When I was very young, somebody-maybe it was a squirrel, they talk so much, or a magpie, or maybe a fishie-told me that Pan owned all this forest. Well, not owned owned. Not like he would sell the forest to someone else, or put a wall all around it-""""Or cut down the trees,"" said Tristran, helpfully. There was a silence. He wondered where the girl had gone. ""Hello?"" he said. ""Hello?""There was another rustle of leaves from above him.""You shouldn't say things like that,"" she said.""Sorry,"" said Tristran, not entirely sure what he was apologizing for. ""But you were telling me that Pan owned the forest...""""Of course he does,"" said the voice. ""It's not hard to own something. Or everything. You just have to know that it's yours, and then be willing to let it go. Pan owns this forest, like that. And in my dream he came over to me. You were in my dream, too, leading a sad girl by a chain. She was a very sad, sad girl. Pan told me to help you.""""Me?""""And it made me feel all warm and tingly and squishy inside, from the tips of my leaves to the end of my roots. So I woke up, and there you were, fast asleep with your head by my trunk, snoring like a pig-wiggin.""Tristran scratched his nose. He stopped looking for a woman in the branches of the copper beech tree above him, and looked instead at the tree itself. ""You are a tree,"" said Tristran, putting his thoughts into words.""I didn't always used to be a tree,"" said the voice in the rustling of the copper beech leaves. ""A magician made me a tree.""""What were you before?"" asked Tristran.""Do you think he likes me?""""Who?""""Pan. If you were the Lord of the Forest, you wouldn't give a job to someone, tell them to give all possible aid and succor, unless you liked them, would you?""""Well..."" said Tristran, but before he had decided on the politic answer, the tree had already said, ""A nymph. I was a wood-nymph. But I got pursued by a prince, not a nice prince, the other kind, and, well, you'd think a prince, even the wrong kind, would understand about boundaries, wouldn't you?""""You would?""""Exactly what I think. But he didn't, so I did a bit of invoking while I was running, and-baboom-tree. What do you think?""""Well,"" said Tristran. ""I do not know what you were like as a wood-nymph, madam, but you are a magnificent tree.""The tree made no immediate reply, but her leaves rustled prettily. ""I was pretty cute as a nymph, too,"" she admitted, coyly.""What kind of aid and succor, exactly?"" asked Tristran. ""Not that I am grumbling. I mean, right now I need all the aid and succor I can get. But a tree is not necessarily the obvious place to look for it. You cannot come with me, or feed me, or bring the star here, or send us back to Wall to see my true love. I am certain you would do a remarkable job of keeping off the rain, were it to rain, but it is not, at present, raining...""The tree rustled. ""Why don't you tell me your story so far,"" said the tree, ""and let me be the best judge of whether or not I can be of help.""Tristran began to protest. He could feel the star moving further and further away from him, at the speed of a cantering unicorn, and if there was one thing he did not have time for, it was the recitation of the adventures of his life to date. But then it occurred to him that any progress he had made on his quest so far he had made by accepting the help that had been offered to him. So he sat on the woodland floor and he told the copper beech everything he could think of: about his love, pure and true, for Victoria Forester; his promise to bring her a fallen star-not any fallen star, but the one they had seen, together, from the top of Dyties Hill; and of his journey into Faerie. He told the tree of his journeyings, of the little hairy man and of the small fair folk who stole his bowler hat; he told her of the magic candle, and his walk across the leagues to the star's side in the glade, and of the lion and the unicorn, and of how he had lost the star.He finished his story, and there was silence. The copper leaves on the tree shivered, softly, as if in a gentle wind, and then harder, as if a storm were coming. And then the leaves formed a fierce, low voice, which said, ""If you had kept her chained, and she had escaped her chains, then there is no power on earth or sky could ever make me help you, not if Great Pan or Lady Sylvia herself were to plead or implore me. But you unchained her, and for that I will help you.""""Thank you,"" said Tristran.""I will tell you three true things. Two of them I will tell you now, and the last is for when you need it most. You will have to judge for yourself when that will be.""First, the star is in great danger. What occurs in the midst of a wood is soon known at its furthest borders, and the trees talk to the wind, and the wind passes the word along to the next wood it comes to. There are forces that mean her harm, and worse than harm. You must find her, and protect her.""Secondly, there is a path through the forest, off past that fir tree (and I could tell you things about that fir tree that would make a boulder blush), and in a few minutes a carriage will be coming down that path. Hurry, and you will not miss it.""And thirdly, hold out your hands.""Tristran held out his hands. From high above him a copper-colored leaf came falling slowly, spinning and gliding and tumbling down. It landed neatly in the palm of his right hand.""There,"" said the tree. ""Keep it safe. And listen to it, when you need it most. Now,"" she told him, ""the coach is nearly here. Run! Run!""Tristran picked up his bag and he ran, fumbling the leaf into the pocket of his tunic as he did so. He could hear hoof-beats through the glade, coming closer and closer. He knew that he could not reach it in time, despaired of reaching it, but still he ran faster, until all he could hear was his heart pounding in his chest and his ears, and the hiss of air as he pulled it into his lungs. He scrambled and dashed through the bracken and made it to the path as the carriage came down the track.It was a black coach drawn by four night-black horses, driven by a pale fellow in a long black robe. It was twenty paces from Tristran. He stood there, gulping breath, and then he tried to call out, but his throat was dry, and his wind was gone, and his voice came from him in a dry sort of croaking whisper. He tried to shout, and simply wheezed.The carriage passed him by without slowing.Tristran sat on the ground and caught his breath. Then, afraid for the star, he got back to his feet and walked, as fast as he could manage, along the forest path. He had not walked for more than ten minutes when he came upon the black coach. A huge branch, itself as big as some trees, had fallen from an oak tree onto the path directly in front of the horses, and the driver, who was also the coach's sole occupant, was endeavoring to lift it out of the way.""Damnedest thing,"" said the coachman, who wore a long black robe and who Tristran estimated to be in his late forties, ""there was no wind, no storm. It simply fell. Terrified the horses."" His voice was deep and booming.Tristran and the driver unhitched the horses, and roped them to the oak branch. Then the two men pushed, and the four horses pulled, and together they dragged the branch to the side of the track. Tristran said a silent thank you to the oak tree whose branch had fallen, to the copper beech and to Pan of the forests, and then he asked the driver if he would give him a ride through the forest.""I do not take passengers,"" said the driver, rubbing his bearded chin.""Of course,"" said Tristran. ""But without me you would still be stuck here. Surely Providence sent you to me, just as Providence sent me to you. I will not take you out of your path, and there may again come a time when you are glad of another pair of hands.""The coach driver looked Tristran over from his head to his feet. Then he reached into the velvet bag that hung from his belt, and removed a handful of square red granite tiles.""Pick one,"" he said to Tristran.Tristran picked a stone tile, and showed the symbol carved upon it to the man. ""Hmm,"" was all the driver said. ""Now pick another."" Tristran did so. ""And another."" The man rubbed his chin once more. ""Yes, you can come with me,"" he said. ""The runes seem certain of that. Although there will be danger. But perhaps there will be more fallen branches to move. You can sit up front, if you wish, on the driver's seat beside me, and keep me company.""It was a peculiar thing, observed Tristran as he climbed up into the driver's seat, but the first time he had glanced into the interior of the coach he had fancied that he saw five pale gentlemen, all in grey, staring sadly out at him. But the next time he had looked inside, nobody had been there at all.The carriage rattled and pounded over the grassy track beneath a golden-green canopy of leaves. Tristran worried about the star. She might be ill-tempered, he thought, but it was with a certain amount of justification, after all. He hoped that she could stay out of trouble until he caught up with her.It was sometimes said that the grey-and-black mountain range which ran like a spine north to south down that part of Faerie had once been a giant, who grew so huge and so heavy that, one day, worn out from the sheer effort of moving and living, he had stretched out on the plain and fallen into a sleep so profound that centuries passed between heartbeats. This would have been a long time ago, if it ever happened, in the First Age of the world, when all was stone and fire, water and wind, and there were few left alive to put the lie to it if it was not true. Still, true or not, they called the four great mountains of the range Mount Head, Mount Shoulder, Mount Belly and Mount Knees, and the foothills to the south were known as the Feet. There were passes through the mountains, one between the head and the shoulders, where the neck would have been, and one immediately to the south of Mount Belly.They were wild mountains, inhabited by wild creatures: slate-colored trolls, hairy wild-men, strayed wodwos, mountain goats and mining gnomes, hermits and exiles and the occasional peak-witch. This was not one of the really high mountain ranges of Faerie, such as Mount Huon, on the top of which is the Stormhold. But it was a hard range for lone travelers to cross nonetheless.The witch-queen had crossed the pass south of Mount Belly in a couple of days, and now waited at the opening of the pass. Her goats were tethered to a thorn bush, which they chewed without enthusiasm. She sat on the side of the unhitched chariot and sharpened her knives with a whetstone.The knives were old things: the hilts were made of bone, while the blades were chipped, volcanic glass, black as jet, with white snowflake-shapes frozen forever into the obsidian. There were two knives: the smaller, a hatchet-bladed cleaver, heavy and hard, for cutting through the rib cage, for jointing and segmenting; the other a long, daggerlike blade, for cutting out the heart. When the knives were so sharp that she could have drawn either blade across your throat, and you would never have felt more than the touch of the lightest hair, as the spreading warmth of your life's blood made a quiet escape, the witch-queen put them away and commenced her preparations.She walked over to the goats and whispered a word of power to each of them.Where the goats had been stood a man with a white chin-beard, and a boyish, dull-eyed young woman. They said nothing.She crouched beside her chariot, and whispered several words to it. The chariot did nothing, and the witch-woman stamped her foot on the rock.""I am getting old,"" she said to her two servants. They said nothing in reply, gave no indication that they even understood her. ""Things inanimate have always been more difficult to change than things animate. Their souls are older and stupider and harder to persuade. If I but had my true youth again... why, in the dawn of the world I could transform mountains into seas and clouds into palaces. I could populate cities with the pebbles on the shingle. If I were young again...""She sighed and raised a hand: a blue flame flickered about her fingers for a moment, and then, as she lowered her hand and bent down to touch her chariot, the fire vanished.She stood up straight. There were streaks of grey now in her raven-black hair, and dark pouches beneath her eyes; but the chariot was gone, and she stood in front of a small inn at the edge of the mountain pass.Far away the thunder rumbled, quietly, and lightning flickered in the distance.The inn sign swung and creaked in the wind. There was a picture of a chariot painted upon it.""You two,"" said the witch-woman, ""inside. She is riding this way, and she will have to come through this pass. Now I simply have to ensure that she will come inside. You,"" she said to the man with the white chin-beard, ""are Billy, the owner of this tavern. I shall be your wife, and this,"" pointing to the dull-eyed girl, who had once been Brevis, ""is our daughter, the pot-maid.""Another crash of thunder echoed down from the mountain peaks, louder than before.""It will rain soon,"" said the witch-woman. ""Let us prepare the fire.""Tristran could feel the star ahead of them, moving steadily onward. He felt as if he were gaining ground upon her.And, to his relief, the black carriage continued to follow the star's path. Once, when the road diverged, Tristran was concerned that they might take the wrong fork. He was ready to leave the coach and travel on alone, if that should happen.His companion reined in the horses, clambered down from the driver's seat, and took out his runes. Then, his consultation complete, he climbed back up, and took the carriage down the left-hand fork.""If it is not too forward of me to enquire,"" said Tristran, ""might I ask what it is that you are in search of?""""My destiny,"" said the man, after a short pause. ""My right to rule. And you?""""There's a young lady that I have offended with my behavior,"" said Tristran. ""I wish to make amends."" As he said it, he knew it to be true.The driver grunted.The forest canopy was thinning rapidly. Trees became sparser, and Tristran stared up at the mountains in front of them, and he gasped. ""Such mountains!"" he said.""When you are older,"" said his companion, ""you must visit my citadel, high on the crags of Mount Huon. Now that is a mountain, and from there we can look down upon mountains next to which these"" and he gestured toward the heights of Mount Belly, ahead of them, ""are the merest foothills.""""Truth to tell,"" said Tristran, ""I hope to spend the rest of my life as a sheep farmer in the village of Wall, for I have now had as much excitement as any man could rightly need, what with candles and trees and the young lady and the unicorn. But I take the invitation in the spirit in which it was given, and thank you for it. If ever you visit Wall then you must come to my house, and I shall give you woolen clothes and sheep-cheese, and all the mutton stew you can eat.""""You are far too kind,"" said the driver. The path was easier now, made of crushed gravel and graded rocks, and he cracked his whip to urge the four black stallions on faster. ""You saw a unicorn, you say?""Tristran was about to tell his companion all about the encounter with the unicorn, but he thought better of it, and simply said, ""He was a most noble beast.""""The unicorns are the moon's creatures,"" said the driver. ""I have never seen one. But it is said that they serve the moon and do her bidding. We shall reach the mountains by tomorrow evening. I shall call a halt at sunset tonight. If you wish, you may sleep inside the coach; I, myself, shall sleep beside the fire."" There was no change in his tone of voice, but Tristran knew, with a certainty that was both sudden and shocking in its intensity, that the man was scared of something, frightened to the depths of his soul.Lightning flickered on the mountaintops that night. Tristran slept on the leather seat of the coach, his head on a sack of oats; he dreamed of ghosts, and of the moon and stars.The rain began at dawn, abruptly, as if the sky had turned to water. Low, grey clouds hid the mountains from sight. In the driving rain Tristran and the coach driver hitched the horses to the carriage and set off. It was all uphill, now, and the horses went no faster than a walk.""You could go inside,"" said the driver. ""No point in us both getting wet."" They had put on one-piece oilskins they had found beneath the driver's seat.""It would be hard for me to be wetter,"" said Tristran, ""without my first leaping into a river. I shall stay here. Two pairs of eyes and two pairs of hands may well be the saving of us.""His companion grunted. He wiped the rain from his eyes and mouth with a cold wet hand, and then he said, ""You're a fool, boy. But I appreciate it."" He transferred the reins to his left hand, and extended his right hand. ""I am known as Primus. The Lord Primus.""""Tristran. Tristran Thorn,"" he said, feeling that the man had, somehow, earned the right to know his true name.They shook hands. The rain fell harder. The horses slowed to the slowest walk as the path became a stream, and the heavy rain cut off all vision as effectively as the thickest fog.""There is a man,"" said the Lord Primus, shouting to be heard now over the rain, the wind whipping the words from his lips. ""He is tall, looks a little like me, but thinner, more crowlike. His eyes seem innocent and dull, but there is death in them. He is called Septimus, for he was the seventh boy-child our father spawned. If ever you see him, run and hide. His business is with me. But he will not hesitate to kill you if you stand in his way, or, perhaps, to make you his instrument with which to kill me.""A wild gust of wind drove a tankardful of rainwater down Tristran's neck.""He sounds a most dangerous man,"" said Tristran.""He is the most dangerous man you will ever meet.""Tristran peered silently into the rain, and the gathering darkness. It was becoming harder to see the road. Primus spoke again, saying, ""If you ask me, there is something unnatural about this storm.""""Unnatural?""""Or more-than-natural; super-natural, if you will. I hope there is an inn along the way. The horses need a rest, and I could do with a dry bed and a warm fire. And a good meal.""Tristran shouted his agreement. They sat together, getting wetter. Tristran thought about the star and the unicorn. She would be cold by now, and wet. He worried about her broken leg, and thought about how saddle sore she must be. It was all his fault. He felt wretched.""I am the most miserable person who ever lived,"" he said to the Lord Primus, when they stopped to feed the horses feedbags of damp oats.""You are young, and in love,"" said Primus. ""Every young man in your position is the most miserable young man who ever lived.""Tristran wondered how Lord Primus could have divined the existence of Victoria Forester. He imagined himself recounting his adventures to her, back at Wall, in front of a blazing parlor fire; but somehow all of his tales seemed a little flat.Dusk seemed to have started at dawn that day, and now the sky was almost black. Their path continued to climb. The rain would let up for moments, and then redouble, falling harder than ever.""Is that a light over there?"" asked Tristran.""I cannot see anything. Maybe it was fool's fire, or lightning..."" said Primus. And then they gained a bend in the road, and he said, ""I was wrong. That is a light. Well-spotted, young 'un. But there are bad things in these mountains. We must only hope that they are friendly.""The horses put on a fresh burst of speed, now that their destination was in sight. A flash of lightning revealed the mountains, rising steeply up on either side of them.""We're in luck!"" said Primus, his bass voice booming like thunder. ""It's an inn!""
ST_ch7	ST	Stardust	7	3115	17370	CHAPTER SEVEN""At the Sign of the Chariot""The star had been soaked to the skin when she arrived at the pass, sad and shivering. She was worried about the unicorn; they had found no food for it on the last day's journey, as the grasses and ferns of the forest had been replaced by grey rocks and stunted thorn bushes. The unicorn's unshod hooves were not meant for the rocky road, nor was its back meant to carry riders, and its pace became slower and slower.As they traveled, the star cursed the day she had fallen to this wet, unfriendly world. It had seemed so gentle and welcoming when seen from high in the sky. That was before. Now, she hated everything about it, except the unicorn; and, saddle sore and uncomfortable, she would have even happily spent time away from the unicorn.After a day of pelting rain, the lights of the inn were the most welcoming sight she had seen in her time on the Earth. ""Watch your step, watch your step,"" pattered the raindrops on the stone. The unicorn stopped, fifty yards from the inn, and would approach no closer. The door to the inn was opened, flooding the grey world with warm yellow light.""Hello there, dearie,"" called a welcoming voice from the open doorway.The star stroked the unicorn's wet neck and spoke softly to the animal, but it made no move, stood there frozen in the light of the inn like a pale ghost.""Will you be coming in, dearie? Or will you be stopping out there in the rain?"" The woman's friendly voice warmed the star, soothed her: just the right mixture of practicality and concern. ""We can get you food, if it's food you're after. There's a fire blazing in the hearth, and enough hot water for a tub that'll melt the chill from your bones.""""I... I will need help coming in..."" said the star. ""My leg...""""Ach, poor mite,"" said the woman. ""I'll have my husband Billy carry you inside. There's hay and fresh water in the stables, for your beast.""The unicorn looked about wildly as the woman approached. ""There, there, dearie. I won't be coming too close. After all, it's been many a long year since I was maiden enough to touch a unicorn, and many a long year since such a one was seen in these parts...""Nervously, the unicorn followed the woman into the stables, keeping its distance from her. It walked along the stable to the furthest stall, where it lay down in the dry straw, and the star scrambled off its back, dripping and miserable.Billy turned out to be a white-bearded, gruff sort of fellow. He said little, but carried the star into the inn, and put her down on a three-legged stool in front of a crackling log fire.""Poor dear,"" said the innkeeper's wife, who had followed them inside. ""Look at you, wet as a water-nixie, look at the puddle under you, and your lovely dress, oh the state of it, you must be soaked to the bone..."" And, sending her husband away, she helped the star remove her dripping wet dress, which she placed on a hook near the fire, where each drip hissed and fizzed when it fell to the hot bricks of the hearth.There was a tin tub in front of the fire, and the innkeeper's wife put up a paper screen around it. ""How d'you like your baths?"" she asked, solicitously, ""warm, hot, or boil-a-lobster?""""I do not know,"" said the star, naked but for the topaz-stone on the silver chain about her waist, her head all in a whirl at the strange turn that events had taken, ""for I have never had a bath before.""""Never had one?"" The innkeeper's wife looked astonished. ""Why, you poor duck; well, we won't make it too hot, then. Call me if you need another copperful of water, I've got some going over the kitchen fire; and when you're done with the bath, I'll bring you some mulled wine, and some sweet-roasted turnips.""And, before the star could protest that she neither ate nor drank, the woman had bustled off, leaving the star sitting in the tin tub, her broken leg in its splints sticking out of the water and resting on the three-legged stool. Initially the water was indeed too hot, but as she became used to the heat she relaxed, and was, for the first time since she had tumbled from the sky, utterly happy.""There's a love,"" said the innkeeper's wife, returning. ""How are you feeling now?""""Much, much better, thank you,"" said the star.""And your heart? How does your heart feel?"" asked the woman.""My heart?"" It was a strange question, but the woman seemed genuinely concerned. ""It feels happier. More easy. Less troubled.""""Good. That's good. Let us get it burning high and hot within you, eh? Burning bright inside you.""""I am sure that under your care my heart shall blaze and burn with happiness,"" said the star.The innkeeper's wife leaned over and chucked the star under the chin. ""There's a pet, such a duck it is, the fine things it says."" And the woman smiled indulgently, and ran a hand through her grey-streaked hair. She hung a thick toweling robe on the edge of the screen. ""This is for you to wear when you are done with your bath-oh no, not to hurry, ducks-it'll be nice and warm for you, and your pretty dress will still be damp for a while now. Just give us a shout when you want to hop out of the tub and I'll come and give you a hand."" Then she leaned over, and touched the star's chest, between her breasts, with one cold finger. And she smiled. ""A good strong heart,"" she said.There were good people on this benighted world, the star decided, warmed and contented. Outside the rain and the wind pattered and howled through the mountain pass, but in the inn, at the Sign of the Chariot, all was warm and comfortable.Eventually the innkeeper's wife, assisted by her dull-faced daughter, helped the star out of her bath. The firelight glinted on the topaz set in silver which the star wore on a knotted silver chain about her waist, until the topaz, and the star's body, vanished beneath the thick toweling of her robe.""Now my sweet,"" said the innkeeper's wife, ""you come over here and make yourself comfortable."" She helped the star over to a long wooden table, at the head of which were laid a cleaver and a knife, both of them with hilts of bone and blades of dark glass. Leaning and limping, the star made it to the table, and sat down at the bench beside it.Outside there was a gust of wind, and the fire flared up green and blue and white. Then a deep voice boomed from outside the inn, over the howl of the elements. ""Service! Food! Wine! Fire! Where is the stableboy?""Billy the innkeeper and his daughter made no move, but only looked at the woman in the red dress as if for instructions. She pursed her lips. And then she said, ""It can wait. For a little. After all, you are not going anywhere, my dearie?"" This last to the star. ""Not on that leg of yours, and not until the rain lets up, eh?""""I appreciate your hospitality more than I can say,"" said the star, simply and with feeling.""Of course you do,"" said the woman in the red dress, and her fidgeting fingers brushed the black knives impatiently, as if there were something she could not wait to be doing. ""Plenty of time when these nuisances have gone, eh?""The light of the inn was the happiest and best thing Tristran had seen on his journey through Faerie. While Primus bellowed for assistance, Tristran unhitched the exhausted horses, and led them one by one into the stables on the side of the inn. There was a white horse asleep in the furthest stall, but Tristran was too busy to pause to inspect it.He knew-somewhere in the odd place inside him that knew directions and distances of things he had never seen and the places he had never been-that the star was close at hand, and this comforted him, and made him nervous. He knew that the horses were more exhausted and more hungry than he was. His dinner-and thus, he suspected, his confrontation with the star-could wait. ""I'll groom the horses,"" he told Primus. ""They'll catch a chill otherwise.""The tall man rested his huge hand on Tristran's shoulder. ""Good lad. I'll send a pot-boy out with some burnt ale for you.""Tristran thought about the star as he brushed down the horses and picked out their hooves. What would he say? What would she say? He was brushing the last of the horses when a blank-looking pot-girl came out to him with a tankard of steaming wine.""Put it down over there,"" he told her. ""I'll drink it with goodwill as soon as my hands are free."" She put it down on the top of a tack box, and went out, without saying anything. It was then that the horse in the end stall got to its feet and began to kick against the door.""Settle down, there,"" called Tristran, ""settle down, fellow, and I'll see if I cannot find warm oats and bran for all of you."" There was a large stone in the stallion's front inside hoof, and Tristran removed it with care. Madam, he had decided he would say, please accept my heartfelt and most humble apologies. Sir, the star would say in her turn, that I shall do with all my heart. Now, let us go to your village, where you shall present me to your true love, as a token of your devotion to her...His ruminations were interrupted by an enormous clattering, as a huge white horse-but, he realized immediately, it was not a horse-kicked down the door of its stall, and came charging, desperately, toward him, its horn lowered.Tristran threw himself onto the straw on the stable floor, his arms about his head.Moments passed. He raised his head. The unicorn had stopped in front of the tankard, was lowering its horn into the mulled wine.Awkwardly, Tristran got to his feet. The wine was steaming and bubbling, and it came to Tristran then-the information surfacing from some long-forgotten fairy tale or piece of children's lore-that a unicorn's horn was proof against... ""Poison?"" he whispered, and the unicorn raised its head, and stared into Tristran's eyes, and Tristran knew that it was the truth. His heart was pounding hard in his chest. Around the inn the wind was screaming like a witch in her madness. Tristran ran to the stable door, then he stopped, and thought. He fumbled in his tunic pocket, finding the lump of wax, which was all that remained of his candle, with a dried copper leaf sticking to it. He peeled the leaf away from the wax with care. Then he raised the leaf to his ear, and listened to what it told him.Wine, milord?"" asked the middle-aged woman in the long red dress, when Primus had entered the inn.""I am afraid not,"" he said. ""I have a personal superstition that, until the day I see my brother's corpse cold on the ground before me, I shall drink only my own wine, and eat only food I have obtained and prepared myself. This I shall do here, if you have no objection. I shall, of course, pay you as if it were your own wine I was drinking. If I might trouble you to put this bottle of mine near the fire to take the chill from it? Now, I have a companion on my journey, a young man who is attending to the horses; he has sworn no such oath, and I am sure that if you could send him a mug of burnt ale it would help take the chill from his bones...?""The pot-maid bobbed a curtsey, and she scuttled back to the kitchens.""So, mine host,"" said Primus to the white-bearded innkeeper, ""how are your beds here at the back of beyond? Have you straw mattresses? Are there fires in the bedrooms? And I note with increasing pleasure that there is a bathtub in front of your fireplace-if there's a fresh copper of steaming water, I shall have a bath later. But I shall pay you no more than a small silver coin for it, mind.""The innkeeper looked to his wife, who said, ""Our beds are good, and I shall have the maid make up a fire in the bedroom for you and your companion.""Primus removed his dripping black robe and hung it by the fire, beside the star's still-damp blue dress. Then he turned, and saw the young lady sitting at the table. ""Another guest?"" he said. ""Well-met, milady, in this noxious weather."" At that, there was a loud clattering from the stable next door. ""Something must have disturbed the horses,"" said Primus, concerned.""Perhaps the thunder,"" said the innkeeper's wife.""Aye, perhaps,"" said Primus. Something else was occupying his attention. He walked over to the star and stared into her eyes for several heartbeats. ""You..."" he hesitated. Then, with certainty, ""You have my father's stone. You have the Power of Stormhold.""The girl glared up at him with eyes the blue of sky. ""Well, then,"" she said. ""Ask me for it, and I can have done with the stupid thing.""The innkeeper's wife hurried over, and stood at the head of the table. ""I'll not have you bothering the other guests now, my dearie-ducks,"" she told him, sternly.Primus's eyes fell upon the knives upon the wood of the tabletop. He recognized them: there were tattered scrolls in the vaults of Stormhold in which those knives were pictured, and their names were given. They were old things, from the First Age of the world.The front door of the inn banged open.""Primus!"" called Tristran, running in. ""They have tried to poison me!""The Lord Primus reached for his short-sword, but even as he went for it the witch-queen took the longest of the knives, and drew the blade of it, in one smooth, practical movement, across his throat...For Tristran, it all happened too fast to follow. He entered, saw the star and Lord Primus, and the innkeeper and his strange family, and then the blood was spurting in a crimson fountain in the firelight.""Get him!"" called the woman in the scarlet dress. ""Get the brat!""Billy and the maid ran toward Tristran; and it was then that the unicorn entered the inn.Tristran threw himself out of the way. The unicorn reared up on its hind legs, and a blow from one of its sharp hooves sent the pot-maid flying.Billy lowered his head and ran, headlong, at the unicorn, as if he were about to butt it with his forehead. The unicorn lowered its head also, and Billy the Innkeeper met his unfortunate end.""Stupid!"" screamed the innkeeper's wife, furiously, and she advanced upon the unicorn, a knife in each hand, blood staining her right hand and forearm the same color as her dress.Tristran had thrown himself onto his hands and knees, and had crawled toward the fireplace. In his left hand he had hold of the lump of wax, all that remained of the candle that had brought him here. He had been squeezing it in his hand until it was soft and malleable.""This had better ought to work,"" said Tristran to himself. He hoped that the tree had known what she was talking about.Behind him, the unicorn screamed in pain.Tristran ripped a lace from his jerkin and closed the wax around it.""What is happening?"" asked the star, who had crawled toward Tristran on her hands and knees.""I don't really know,"" he admitted.The witch-woman howled, then; the unicorn had speared her with its horn, through the shoulder. It lifted her off the ground, triumphantly, preparing to hurl her to the ground and then to dash her to death beneath its sharp hooves, when, impaled as she was, the witch-woman swung around and thrust the point of the longer of the rock-glass knives into the unicorn's eye and far into its skull.The beast dropped to the wooden floor of the inn, blood dripping from its side and from its eye and from its open mouth. First it fell to its knees, and then it collapsed, utterly, as the life fled. Its tongue was piebald, and it protruded most pathetically from the unicorn's dead mouth.The witch-queen pulled her body from the horn, and, one hand gripping her wounded shoulder, the other holding her cleaver, she staggered to her feet.Her eyes scanned the room, alighting on Tristran and the star huddled by the fire. Slowly, agonizingly slowly, she lurched toward them, a cleaver in her hand and a smile upon her face.""The burning golden heart of a star at peace is so much finer than the flickering heart of a little frightened star,"" she told them, her voice oddly calm and detached, coming, as it was, from that blood-bespattered face. ""But even the heart of a star who is afraid and scared is better by far than no heart at all.""Tristran took the star's hand in his right hand. ""Stand up,"" he told her.""I cannot,"" she said, simply.""Stand, or we die now,"" he told her, getting to his feet. The star nodded, and, awkwardly, resting her weight on him, she began to try to pull herself to her feet.""Stand, or you die now?"" echoed the witch-queen. ""Oh, you die now, children, standing or sitting. It is all the same to me."" She took another step toward them.""Now,"" said Tristran, one hand gripping the star's arm, the other holding his makeshift candle, ""now, walk!""And he thrust his left hand into the fire.There was pain, and burning, such that he could have screamed, and the witch-queen stared at him as if he were madness personified.Then his improvised wick caught, and burned with a steady blue flame, and the world began to shimmer around them. ""Please walk,"" he begged the star. ""Don't let go of me.""And she took an awkward step.They left the inn behind them, the howls of the witch-queen ringing in their ears.They were underground, and the candlelight flickered from the wet cave walls; and with their next halting step they were in a desert of white sand, in the moonlight; and with their third step they were high above the earth, looking down on the hills and trees and rivers far below them.And it was then that the last of the wax ran molten over Tristran's hand, and the burning became impossible for him to bear, and the last of the flame burned out forever.
ST_ch8	ST	Stardust	8	7534	41485	CHAPTER EIGHTWhich Treats of Castles in the Air, and Other MattersIt was dawn in the mountains. The storms of the last few days had passed on and the air was clean and cold.Lord Septimus of Stormhold, tall and crowlike, walked up the mountain pass, looking about him as he walked as if he were seeking something he had lost. He was leading a brown mountain pony, shaggy and small. Where the pass grew wider he stopped, as if he had found what he was looking for beside the trail. It was a small, battered chariot, little more than a goat-cart, which had been tipped onto its side. Nearby it lay two bodies. The first was that of a white billy goat, its head stained red with blood. Septimus prodded the dead goat experimentally with his foot, moving its head; it had received a deep and fatal wound to its forehead, equidistant between its horns. Next to the goat was the body of a young man, his face as dull in death as it must have been in life. There were no wounds to show how he had died, nothing but a leaden bruise upon his temple.Several yards away from these bodies, half-hidden beside a rock, Septimus came upon the corpse of a man in his middle years, facedown, dressed in dark clothes. The man's flesh was pale, and his blood had pooled upon the rocky floor below him. Septimus crouched down beside the body, and, gingerly, lifted its head by the hair; its throat had been cut, expertly, slit from one ear to the other. Septimus stared at the corpse in puzzlement. He knew it, yet...And then, in a dry, hacking cough of a noise, he began to laugh. ""Your beard,"" he told the corpse, aloud. ""You cut your beard. As if I would not have known you with your beard gone, Primus.""Primus, who stood, grey and ghostly, beside his other brothers, said, ""You would have known me, Septimus. But it might have bought me a few moments, wherein I might have seen you before you knew me,"" and his dead voice was nothing but the morning breeze rattling the thorn bush.Septimus stood up. The sun began to rise, then, over the easternmost peak of Mount Belly, framing him in light. ""So I am to be the eighty-second Lord of the Stormhold,"" he said to the corpse on the ground, and to himself, ""not to mention the Master of the High Crags, Seneschal of the Spire-Towns, Keeper of the Citadel, Lord High Guardian of Mount Huon and all the rest of it.""""Not without the Power of Stormhold about your neck you're not, my brother,"" said Quintus, tartly.""And then there's the matter of revenge,"" said Secundus, in the voice of the wind howling through the pass. ""You must take revenge upon your brother's killer before anything else, now. It's blood-law.""As if he had heard them, Septimus shook his head. ""Why could you not have waited just a few more days, brother Primus?"" he asked the corpse at his feet. ""I would have killed you myself. I had a fine plan for your death. When I discovered you were no longer on the Heart of a Dream, it took me little enough time to steal the ship's boat and get on your trail. And now I must revenge your sad carcass, and all for the honor of our blood and the Stormhold.""""So Septimus will be the eighty-second Lord of Stormhold,"" said Tertius.""There is a proverbial saying chiefly concerned with warning against too closely calculating the numerical value of un-hatched chicks,"" pointed out Quintus.Septimus walked away from the body to piss against a grey boulder. Then he walked back to Primus's corpse. ""If I had killed you, I could leave you here to rot,"" he said. ""But because that pleasure was another's, I shall carry you with me a little way, and leave you on a high crag, to be eaten by eagles."" With that, grunting with the effort, he picked up the sticky-fronted body and hauled it over the back of the pony. He fumbled at the corpse's belt, removing the bag of rune stones. ""Thank you for these, my brother,"" he said, and he patted the corpse on the back.""May you choke on them if you do not take revenge on the bitch who slit my gullet,"" said Primus, in the voice of the mountain birds waking to greet the new day.They sat side by side on a thick, white cumulus cloud the size of a small town. The cloud was soft beneath them, and a little cold. It became colder the deeper into it one sank, and Tristran pushed his burned hand as far as he could down into the fabric of it: it resisted him slightly, but accepted his hand. The interior of the cloud felt spongy and chilly, real and insubstantial at once. The cloud cooled a little of the pain in his hand, allowing him to think more clearly.""Well,"" he said, after some time, ""I'm afraid I've made rather a mess of everything.""The star sat on the cloud beside him, wearing the robe she had borrowed from the woman in the inn, with her broken leg stretched out on the thick mist in front of her. ""You saved my life,"" she said, eventually. ""Didn't you?""""I suppose I must have done, yes.""""I hate you,"" she said. ""I hated you for everything already, but now I hate you most of all.""Tristran flexed his burned hand in the blessed cool of the cloud. He felt tired and slightly faint. ""Any particular reason?""""Because,"" she told him, her voice taut, ""now that you have saved my life, you are, by the law of my people, responsible for me, and I for you. Where you go, I must also go.""""Oh,"" he said. ""That's not that bad, is it?""""I would rather spend my days chained to a vile wolf or a stinking pig or a marsh-goblin,"" she told him flatly.""I'm honestly not that bad,"" he told her, ""not when you get to know me. Look, I'm sorry about all that chaining you up business. Perhaps we could start all over again, just pretend it never happened. Here now, my name's Tristran Thorn, pleased to meet you."" He held out his unburned hand to her.""Mother Moon defend me!"" said the star. ""I would sooner take the hand of an-""""I'm sure you would,"" said Tristran, not waiting to find out what he was going to be unflatteringly compared to this time. ""I've said I'm sorry,"" he told her. ""Let's start afresh. I'm Tristran Thorn. Pleased to meet you.""She sighed.The air was thin and chill so high above the ground, but the sun was warm, and the cloud-shapes about them reminded Tristran of a fantastical city or an unearthly town. Far, far below he could see the real world: the sunlight pricking out every tiny tree, turning every winding river into a thin silver snail-trail glistening and looping across the landscape of Faerie.""Well?"" said Tristran.""Aye,"" said the star. ""It is a mighty joke, is it not? Whither thou goest, there I must go. Even if it kills me."" She swirled the surface of the cloud with her hand, rippling the mist. Then, momentarily, she touched her hand to Tristran's. ""My sisters called me Yvaine,"" she told him. ""For I was an evening star."" ""Look at us,"" he said. ""A fine pair. You with your broken leg, me with my hand."" ""Show me your hand.""He pulled it from the cool of the cloud: his hand was red, and blisters were coming up on each side of it and on the back of it, where the flames had licked against his flesh. ""Does it hurt?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" he said. ""Quite a lot, really."" ""Good,"" said Yvaine.""If my hand had not been burned, you would probably be dead now,"" he pointed out. She had the grace to look down, ashamed. ""You know,"" he added, changing the subject, ""I left my bag in that madwoman's inn. We have nothing now, save the clothes we stand up in.""""Sit down in,"" corrected the star.""There's no food, no water, we're half a mile or so above the world with no way of getting down, and no control over where the cloud is going. And both of us are injured. Did I leave anything out?""""You forgot the bit about clouds dissipating and vanishing into nothing,"" said Yvaine. ""They do that. I've seen them. I could not survive another fall.""Tristran shrugged. ""Well,"" he said. ""We're probably doomed, then. But we may as well have a look around while we're up here.""He helped Yvaine to her feet and, awkwardly, the two of them took several faltering steps on the cloud. Then Yvaine sat down again. ""This is no use,"" she told him. ""You go and look around. I will wait here for you.""""Promise?"" he asked. ""No running away this time?""""I swear it. On my mother the moon I swear it,"" said Yvaine, sadly. ""You saved my life.""And with that Tristran had to content himself.Her hair was mostly grey, now, and her face was pouched, and wrinkled at the throat and eyes and at the corners of the mouth. There was no color to her face, although her skirt was a vivid, bloody splash of scarlet; it had been ripped at the shoulder, and beneath the rip could be seen, puckered and obscene, a deep scar. The wind whipped her hair about her face as she drove the black carriage on through the Barrens. The four stallions stumbled often: thick sweat dripped from their flanks and a bloody foam dripped from their lips. Still, their hooves pounded along the muddy path through the Barrens, where nothing grows.The witch-queen, oldest of the Lilim, reined in the horses beside a pinnacle of rock the color of verdigris, which jutted from the marshy soil of the Barrens like a needle. Then, as slowly as might be expected from any lady no longer in her first, or even her second, youth, she climbed down from the driver's seat to the wet earth.She walked around the coach, and opened the door. The head of the dead unicorn, her dagger still in its cold eye-socket, flopped down as she did so. The witch clambered up into the coach, and pulled open the unicorn's mouth. Rigor mortis was starting to set in, and the jaw opened only with difficulty. The witch-woman bit down, hard, on her own tongue, bit hard enough that the pain was metal-sharp in her mouth, bit down until she could taste the blood. She swirled it around in her mouth, mixing the blood with spittle (she could feel that several of her front teeth were beginning to come loose), then she spat onto the dead unicorn's piebald tongue. Blood flecked her lips and chin. She grunted several syllables that shall not be recorded here, then pushed the unicorn's mouth closed once more. ""Get out of the coach,"" she told the dead beast.Stiffly, awkwardly, the unicorn raised its head. Then it moved its legs, like a newborn foal or fawn just learning to walk, and twitched and pushed itself up onto all fours and, half climbing, half falling, it tumbled out of the carriage door and onto the mud, where it raised itself to its feet. Its left side, upon which it had lain in the coach, was swollen and dark with blood and fluids. Half-blind, the dead unicorn stumbled toward the green rock needle until it reached a depression at its base, where it dropped to the knees of its forelegs in a ghastly parody of prayer.The witch-queen reached down and pulled her knife from out of the beast's eye-socket. She sliced across its throat. Blood began to ooze, too slowly, from the gash she had made. She walked back to the carriage and returned with her cleaver. Then she began to hack at the unicorn's neck, until she had separated it from the body, and the severed head tumbled into the rock hollow, now filling with a dark red puddle of brackish blood.She took the unicorn's head by the horn and placed it beside the body, on the rock; thereupon she looked with her hard, grey eyes into the red pool she had made. Two faces stared out at her from the puddle: two women, older by far in appearance than she was now.""Where is she?"" asked the first face, peevishly. ""What have you done with her?""""Look at you!"" said the second of the Lilim. ""You took the last of the youth we had saved-I tore it from the star's breast myself, long, long ago, though she screamed and writhed and carried on ever-so. From the looks of you, you've squandered most of the youth already.""""I came so close,"" said the witch-woman to her sisters in the pool. ""But she had a unicorn to protect her. Now I have the unicorn's head, and I will bring it back with me, for it's long enough since we had fresh ground unicorn's horn in our arts.""""Unicorn's horn be damned,"" said her youngest sister. ""What about the star?""""I cannot find her. It is almost as if she were no longer in Faerie.""There was a pause.""No,"" said one of her sisters. ""She is still in Faerie. But she is going to the Market at Wall, and that is too close to the world on the other side of the wall. Once she goes into that world, she will be lost to us.""For they each of them knew that, were the star to cross the wall and enter the world of things as they are, she would become, in an instant, no more than a pitted lump of metallic rock that had fallen, once, from the heavens: cold and dead and of no more use to them.""Then I shall go to Diggory's Dyke and wait there, for all who go to Wall must pass that way.""The reflections of the two old women gazed disapprovingly out of the pool. The witch-queen ran her tongue over her teeth (that one at the top will be out by nightfall, she thought, the way it wobbles so) and then she spat into the bloody pool. The ripples spread across it, erasing all traces of the Lilim; now the pool reflected only the sky over the Barrens and the faint white clouds far above them.She kicked the headless corpse of the unicorn so it tumbled over onto its side. Then she took up its head, and she carried it with her up to the driver's seat. She placed it beside her, picked up the reins and whipped the restive horses into a tired trot.Tristran sat at the top of the spire of cloud and wondered why none of the heroes of the penny dreadfuls he used to read so avidly were ever hungry. His stomach rumbled, and his hand hurt him so.Adventures are all very well in their place, he thought, but there's a lot to be said for regular meals and freedom from pain.Still, he was alive, and the wind was in his hair, and the cloud was scudding through the sky like a galleon at full sail. Looking out over the world from above, he could never remember feeling so alive as he did at that moment. There was a shyness to the sky and a newness to the world that he had never seen or felt or realized before.He understood that he was, in some way, above his problems, just as he was above the world. The pain in his hand was a long way away. He thought about his actions and his adventures, and about the journey ahead of him, and it seemed to Tristran that the whole business was suddenly very small and very straightforward. He stood up on the cloud spire and called ""Halloo!"" several times, as loudly as he could. He even waved his tunic over his head, feeling a little foolish as he did so. Then he clambered down the spire; ten feet from the bottom he missed his footing and fell into the misty softness of the cloud.""What were you shouting about?"" asked Yvaine.""To let people know we were here,"" Tristran told her.""What people?""""You never know,"" he told her. ""Better I should call to people who aren't there than that people who are there should miss us because I didn't say anything.""She said nothing in reply to this.""I've been thinking,"" said Tristran. ""And what I've been thinking is this. After we're done with what I need-got you back to Wall, given you to Victoria Forester-perhaps we could do what you need.""""What I need?""""Well, you want to go back, don't you? Up into the sky. To shine again at night. So we can sort that out.""She looked up at him and shook her head. ""That doesn't happen,"" she explained. ""Stars fall. They don't go back up again.""""You could be the first,"" he told her. ""You have to believe. Otherwise it will never happen.""""It will never happen,"" she told him. ""No more than your shouting is going to attract anyone up here where there isn't anyone. It doesn't matter if I believe it or not, that's just the way things are. How's your hand?""He shrugged. ""Hurts,"" he said. ""How's your leg?""""Hurts,"" she said. ""But not as badly as it did before.""""Ahoy!"" came a voice from far above them. ""Ahoy down there! Parties in need of assistance?""Glinting golden in the sunlight was a small ship, its sails billowing, and a ruddy, mustachioed face looked down at them from over the side. ""Was that you, young feller-me-lad, a-leaping and cavorting just now?""""It was,"" said Tristran. ""And I think we are in need of assistance, yes.""""Right-ho,"" said the man. ""Get ready to grab the ladder, then.""""I'm afraid my friend has a broken leg,"" he called, ""and I've hurt my hand. I don't think either of us can climb a ladder.""""Not a problem. We can pull you up."" And with that the man tumbled a long rope ladder over the side of the ship. Tristran caught at it with his good hand, and he held it steady while Yvaine pulled herself onto it, then he climbed on below her. The face vanished from the side of the ship as Tristran and Yvaine dangled awkwardly on the end of the rope ladder.The wind caught the sky-ship, causing the ladder to pull up from the cloud, and Tristran and Yvaine to spin, slowly, in the air.""Now, haul!"" shouted several voices in unison, and Tristran felt them being hauled up several feet. ""Haul! Haul! Haul!"" Each shout signaled them being pulled higher. The cloud upon which they had been sitting was now no longer below them; instead there was a drop of what Tristran supposed must be a mile or more. He held on tightly to the rope, hooking the elbow of his burned hand about the rope ladder.Another jerk upwards and Yvaine was level with the top of the ship's railing. Someone lifted her with care and placed her upon the deck. Tristran clambered over the railing himself, and tumbled down onto the oaken deck.The ruddy-faced man extended a hand. ""Welcome aboard,"" he said. ""This is the Free Ship Perdita, bound on a lightning-hunting expedition. Captain Johannes Alberic, at your service."" He coughed, deep in his chest. And then, before Tristran could say a word in reply, the captain spied Tristran's left hand, and called ""Meggot! Meggot! Blast you, where are you? Over here! Passengers in need of attention. There lad, Meggot'll see to your hand. We eat at six bells. You shall sit at my table.""Soon a nervous-looking woman with an explosive mop of carrot-red hair-Meggot-was escorting him belowdecks, and smearing a thick, green ointment onto his hand, which cooled it and eased the pain. And then he was being led into the mess, which was a small dining room next to the kitchen (which he was delighted to discover they referred to as the galley, just as in the sea stories he had read).Tristran did indeed get to eat at the captain's table, although there was in fact no other table in the mess. In addition to the captain and Meggot there were five other members of the crew, a disparate bunch who seemed content to let Captain Alberic do all the talking, which he did, with his ale-pot in one hand, and the other hand alternately concerned with holding his stubby pipe and conveying food into his mouth.The food was a thick soup of vegetables, beans and barley, and it filled Tristran and contented him. To drink, there was the clearest, coldest water Tristran had ever tasted.The captain asked them no questions about how they came to find themselves high on a cloud, and they volunteered no answers. Tristran was given a berth with Oddness, the first mate, a quiet gentleman with large wings and a bad stammer, while Yvaine berthed in Meggot's cabin, and Meggot herself moved into a hammock.Tristran often found himself looking back on his time on the Perdita, during the rest of his journey through Faerie, as one of the happiest periods of his life. The crew let him help with the sails, and even gave him a turn at the wheel from time to time. Sometimes the ship would sail above dark storm clouds, as big as mountains, and the crew would fish for lightning bolts with a small copper chest. The rain and the wind would wash the deck of the ship, and he often would find himself laughing with exhilaration, while the rain ran down his face, and gripping the rope railing with his good hand to keep from being tumbled over the side by the storm.Meggot, who was a little taller and a little thinner than Yvaine, had lent her several gowns, which the star wore with relief, taking pleasure in wearing something new on different days. Often she would climb out to the figurehead, despite her broken leg, and sit, looking down at the ground below.How's your hand?"" asked the captain.""A lot better, thank you,"" said Tristran. The skin was shiny and scarred, and he had little feeling in the fingers, but Meggot's salve had taken most of the pain, and sped the healing process immeasurably. He had been sitting on deck, with his legs dangling over the side, looking out.""We'll be taking anchor in a week, to take provisions, and a little cargo,"" said the captain. ""Might be best if we were to let you off down there.""""Oh. Thank you,"" said Tristran.""You'll be closer to Wall. Still a good ten-week journey, though. Maybe more. But Meggot says she's nearly got your friend's leg up to snuff. It'll be able to take her weight again soon.""They sat, side by side. The captain puffed on his pipe: his clothes were covered in a fine layer of ash, and when he was not smoking his pipe he was chewing at the stem, or excavating the bowl with a sharp metal instrument, or tamping in new tobacco.""You know,"" said the captain, staring off toward the horizon, ""it wasn't entirely fortune that we found you. Well, it was fortune that we found you, but it'd also be true to say that I was keeping half an eye out for you. I, and a few others about the place.""""Why?"" said Tristran. ""And how did you know about me?""In reply, the captain traced a shape with his finger in the condensation on the polished wood.""It looks like a castle,"" said Tristran.The captain winked at him. ""Not a word to say too loudly,"" he said, ""even up here. Think of it as a fellowship.""Tristran stared at him. ""Do you know a little hairy man, with a hat and an enormous pack of goods?""The captain tapped his pipe against the side of the boat. A movement of his hand had already erased the picture of the castle. ""Aye. And he's not the only member of the fellowship with an interest in your return to Wall. Which reminds me, you should tell the young lady that if she fancies trying to pass for other than what she is, she might try to give the impression that she eats something-anything-from time to time.""""I never mentioned Wall in your presence,"" said Tristran. ""When you asked where I was came from, I said 'Behind us' and when you asked where we were going, I said, 'Ahead of us.' """"That's m'boy,"" said the captain. ""Exactly.""Another week passed, on the fifth day of which Meggot pronounced Yvaine's splint ready to come off. She removed the makeshift bandages and the splint, and Yvaine practiced hobbling about the decks from bow to stern, holding onto the rails. Soon she was moving about the ship without difficulty, albeit with a slight limp.On the sixth day there was a mighty storm, and they caught six fine lightning bolts in their copper box. On the seventh day they made port. Tristran and Yvaine said their good-byes to the captain and the crew of the Free Ship Perdita. Meggot gave Tristran a small pot of the green salve, for his hand and for Yvaine to rub onto her leg. The captain gave Tristran a leather shoulder-bag filled with dried meats and fruits and fragments of tobacco, a knife and a tinderbox (""Oh, it's no bother, lad. We're taking on provisions here anyway),"" while Meggot made Yvaine a gift of a blue silk gown, sewn with tiny silver stars and moons (""For it looks so much better on you than it ever has on me, my dear)"".The ship moored beside a dozen other, similar sky-ships, at the top of a huge tree, large enough to support hundreds of dwellings built into the trunk. It was inhabited by people and dwarfs, by gnomes and sylvans and other, even queerer, folk. There were steps around the trunk, and Tristran and the star descended them slowly. Tristran was relieved to be back on something attached to solid ground, and yet, in some way he could never have put into words, he felt disappointed, as if, when his feet touched the earth once more, he had lost something very fine.It was three days of walking before the harbor-tree disappeared over the horizon.They traveled West, toward the sunset, along a wide and dusty road. They slept beside hedgerows. Tristran ate fruit and nuts from bushes and trees and he drank from clear streams. They encountered few other people on the road. When they could, they stopped at small farms, where Tristran would put in an afternoon's work in exchange for food and some straw in the barn to sleep upon. Sometimes they would stop in the towns and villages upon the way, to wash, and eat-or, in the star's case, to feign eating-and to room, whenever they could afford it, at the town's inn.In the town of Simcock-Under-Hill, Tristran and Yvaine had an encounter with a goblin press-gang that might have ended unhappily, with Tristran spending the rest of his life fighting the goblins' endless wars beneath the earth, had it not been for Yvaine's quick thinking and her sharp tongue. In Berinhed's Forest Tristran outfaced one of the great, tawny eagles, who would have carried them both back to its nest to feed its young and was afraid of nothing at all, save fire.In a tavern in Fulkeston, Tristran gained great renown by reciting from memory Coleridge's ""Kubla Khan,"" the Twenty-Third Psalm, the ""Quality of Mercy"" speech from The Merchant of Venice, and a poem about a boy who stood on the burning deck where all but he had fled, each of which he had been obliged to commit to memory in his school days. He blessed Mrs. Cherry for her efforts in making him memorize verse, until it became apparent that the townsfolk of Fulkeston had decided that he would stay with them forever and become the next bard of the town; Tristran and Yvaine were forced to sneak out of the town at the dead of night, and they only escaped because Yvaine persuaded (by some means, on which Tristran was never entirely clear) the dogs of the town not to bark as they left.The sun burnt Tristran's face to a nut-brown color, and faded his clothes to the hues of rust and of dust. Yvaine remained as pale as the moon, and she did not lose her limp, no matter how many leagues they covered.One evening, camped at the edge of a deep wood, Tristran heard something he had never heard before: a beautiful melody, plangent and strange. It filled his head with visions, and filled his heart with awe and delight. The music made him think of spaces without limits, of huge crystalline spheres which revolved with unutterable slowness through the vasty halls of the air. The melody transported him, took him beyond himself.After what might have been long hours, and might have been only minutes, it ended, and Tristran sighed. ""That was wonderful,"" he said. The star's lips moved, involuntarily, into a smile, and her eyes brightened. ""Thank you,"" she said. ""I suppose that I have not felt like singing until now.""""I have never heard anything like it.""""Some nights,"" she told him, ""my sisters and I would sing together. Sing songs like that one, all about the lady our mother, and the nature of time, and the joys of shining and of loneliness.""""I'm sorry,"" he said.""Don't be,"" she told him. ""At least I am still alive. I was lucky to have fallen in Faerie. And I think I was probably lucky to have met you.""""Thank you,"" said Tristran.""You are welcome,"" said the star. She sighed, then, in her turn, and stared up at the sky through the gaps in the trees.Tristran was looking for breakfast. He had found some young puffball mushrooms, and a plum tree covered with purple plums which had ripened and dried almost to prunes, when he spotted the bird in the undergrowth.He made no attempt to catch it (he had had a severe shock some weeks earlier, when, having narrowly failed to capture a large grey-brown hare for his dinner, it had stopped at the edge of the forest, looked at him with disdain, and said, ""Well, I hope you're proud of yourself, that's all,"" and had scampered off into the long grass) but he was fascinated by it. It was a remarkable bird, as large as a pheasant, but with feathers of all colors, garish reds and yellows and vivid blues. It looked like a refugee from the tropics, utterly out of place in this green and ferny wood. The bird started in fear as he approached it, hopping awkwardly as he came closer and letting out cries of sharp distress.Tristran dropped to one knee next to it, murmuring reassurances. He reached out to the bird. The difficulty was obvious: a silver chain attached to the bird's foot had become entangled in the twisted stub of a jutting root, and the bird was caught there by it, unable to move.Carefully, Tristran unwound the silver chain, unhooking it from the root, while stroking the bird's ruffled plumage with his left hand. ""There you go,"" he said to the bird. ""Go home.""But the bird made no move to leave him. Instead it stared into his face, its head cocked on one side. ""Look,"" said Tristran, feeling rather odd and self-conscious, ""someone will probably be worried about you."" He reached down to pick up the bird.Something hit him, then, stunning him; although he had been still, he felt as if he had just run at full tilt into an invisible wall. He staggered, and nearly fell.""Thief!"" shouted a cracked old voice. ""I shall turn your bones to ice and roast you in front of a fire! I shall pluck your eyes out and tie one to a herring and t'other to a seagull, so the twin sights of sea and sky shall take you into madness! I shall make your tongue into a writhing worm and your fingers shall become razors, and fire ants shall itch your skin, so each time you scratch yourself-""""There is no need to belabor your point,"" said Tristran to the old woman. ""I did not steal your bird. Its chain was snagged upon a root, and I had just freed it.""She glared at him suspiciously from below her mop of iron-grey hair. Then she scurried forward, and picked up the bird. She held it up, and whispered something to it, and it replied with an odd, musical chirp. The old woman's eyes narrowed. ""Well, perhaps what you say is not a complete pack of lies,"" she admitted, extremely grudgingly.""It's not a pack of lies at all,"" said Tristran, but the old woman and her bird were already halfway across the glade, so he gathered up his puffballs and his plums, and he walked back to where he had left Yvaine.She was sitting beside the path, rubbing her feet. Her hip pained her, and so did her leg, while her feet were becoming more and more sensitive. Sometimes at night Tristran would hear her sobbing softly to herself. He hoped the moon would send them another unicorn, and knew that she would not.""Well,"" said Tristran to Yvaine, ""that was odd."" He told her about the events of the morning, and thought that that was the end of it.He was, of course, wrong. Several hours later Tristran and the star were walking along the forest path when they were passed by a brightly painted caravan, pulled by two grey mules and driven by the old woman who had threatened to change his bones to ice. She reined in her mules and crooked a bony finger at Tristran, ""Come here, lad,"" she said.He walked over to her warily. ""Yes, ma'am?""""Seems I owe you an apology,"" she said. ""Seems you were telling the truth. Jumped to a conclusion.""""Yes,"" said Tristran.""Let me look at you,"" she said, climbing down into the roadway. Her cold finger touched the soft place beneath Tristran's chin, forcing his head up. His hazel eyes stared into her old green eyes. ""You look honest enough,"" she said. ""You can call me Madame Semele. I'm on my way to Wall, for the market. I was thinking that I'd welcome a boy to work my little flower-stall-I sells glass flowers, you know, the prettiest things that ever you did see. You'd be a fine market-lad, and we could put a glove over that hand of yours, so you'd not scare the customers. What d'ye say?""Tristran pondered, and said ""Excuse me,"" and went over and conferred with Yvaine. Together they walked back to the old woman.""Good afternoon,"" said the star. ""We have discussed your offer, and we thought that-"""" Well?"" asked Madame Semele, her eyes fixed upon Tristran. ""Don't just stand there like a dumb thing! Speak! Speak! Speak!""""I have no desire to work for you at the market,"" said Tristran, ""for I have business of my own that I shall need to deal with there. However, if we could ride with you, my companion and I are willing to pay you for our passage.""Madame Semele shook her head. ""That's of no use to me. I can gather my own firewood, and you'd just be another weight for Faithless and Hopeless to pull. I take no passengers."" She climbed back up into the driver's seat.""But,"" said Tristran, ""I would pay you.""The harridan cackled with scorn. ""There's never a thing you could possess that I would take for your passage. Now, if you'll not work for me at the market at Wall, then be off with you.""Tristran reached up to the buttonhole of his jerkin, and felt it there, as cold and perfect as it had been through all his journeyings. He pulled it out, and held it up to the old woman between finger and thumb. ""You sell glass flowers, you say,"" he said. ""Would you be interested in this one?""It was a snowdrop made of green glass and white glass, cunningly fashioned: it seemed as if it had been plucked from the meadow grass that very morning, and the dew was still upon it. The old woman squinted at it for a heartbeat, looking at its green leaves and its tight white petals, then she let out a screech: it might have been the anguished cry of some bereft bird of prey. ""Where did you get that?"" she cried. ""Give it to me! Give it to me this instant!""Tristran closed his finger about the snowdrop, concealing it from view, and he took a couple of steps backwards. ""Hmm,"" he said aloud. ""It occurs to me now that I have a deep fondness for this flower, which was a gift from my father when I commenced my travels, and which, I suspect, carries with it a tremendous personal and familial importance. Certainly it has brought me luck, of one kind or another. Perhaps I would be better off keeping the flower, and my companion and I can walk to Wall.""Madame Semele seemed torn between her desire to threaten and to cajole, and the emotions chased each other so nakedly across her face that she seemed almost to vibrate with the effort of keeping them in check. And then she took herself in hand and said, in a voice that cracked with self-control, ""Now, now. No need to be hasty. I am certain that a deal can be struck between us.""""Oh,"" said Tristran, ""I doubt it. It would need to be a very fine deal, to interest me, and it would need certain guarantees of safe-conduct and such safeguards as to assure that your behavior and actions toward me and my companion remained at all times benign.""""Let me see the snowdrop again,"" pleaded the old woman.The bright-colored bird, its silver chain about one leg, fluttered out of the open door of the caravan, and gazed down at the proceedings beneath.""The poor thing,"" said Yvaine, ""chained up like that. Why do you not set her free?""But the old woman did not answer her, ignoring her, or so Tristran thought, and said, ""I will transport you to Wall, and I swear upon my honor and upon my true name that I will take no action to harm you upon the journey.""""Or by inaction, or indirect action, allow harm to come to me or my companion.""""As you say.""Tristran thought for a moment. He certainly did not trust the old woman. ""I wish you to swear that we shall arrive in Wall in the same manner and condition and state that we are in now, and that you will give us board and lodging upon the way.""The old woman clucked, then nodded. She clambered down from the caravan once more, and hawked, then spat into the dust. She pointed to the glob of spittle. ""Now you,"" she said. Tristran spat next to it. With her foot she rubbed both wet patches, so they conjoined. ""There,"" she said. ""A bargain's a bargain. Give me the flower.""The greed and hunger were so obvious in her face that Tristran was now certain he could have made a better deal, but he gave the old woman his father's flower. As she took it from him, her face broke into a gap-toothed grin. ""Why, I do think that this is the superior of the one that damnable child gave away almost twenty years gone. Now, tell me young man,"" she asked, looking up at Tristran with her sharp old eyes, ""do you know what manner of thing you have been wearing in your buttonhole?""""It is a flower. A glass flower.""The old woman laughed so hard and so suddenly that Tristran thought that she was choking. ""It is a frozen charm,"" she said. ""A thing of power. Something like this can perform wonders and miracles in the right hands. Watch."" She held the snowdrop above her head then brought it slowly down, so it brushed Tristran's forehead.For but a heartbeat he felt most peculiar, as if thick, black treacle were running through his veins in place of blood; then the shape of the world changed. Everything became huge and towering. It seemed as if the old woman herself was now a giantess, and his vision was blurred and confused.Two huge hands came down and picked him up, gently. ""'Tain't the biggest of caravans,"" said Madame Semele, her voice a low, slow liquid boom. ""And I shall keep to the letter of my oath, for you shall not be harmed, and you shall be boarded and lodged on your journey to Wall."" And then she dropped the dormouse into the pocket of her apron and she clambered onto the caravan.""And what do you propose to do to me?"" asked Yvaine, but she was not entirely surprised when the woman did not reply. She followed the old woman into the dark interior of the caravan. There was but one room; along one wall was a large showcase made of leather and pine, with a hundred pigeonholes in it, and it was in one of these pigeonholes, in a bed of soft thistledown, that the old woman placed the snowdrop. Along the other wall was a small bed, with a window above it, and a large cupboard.Madame Semele bent down and pulled a wooden cage from the cluttered space beneath her bed, and she took the blinking dormouse from her pocket and placed it into the cage. Then she took a handful of nuts and berries and seeds from a wooden bowl and placed them inside the cage, which she hung from a chain in the middle of the caravan.""There we go,"" she said. ""Board and lodging.""Yvaine had watched all this with curiosity from her seat on the old woman's bed. ""Would I be correct,"" she asked politely, ""in concluding from the evidence to hand (to wit, that you have not looked at me, or if you have your eyes have slipped over me, that you have not spoken a word to me, and that you have changed my companion into a small animal with no such provision for myself) that you can neither see me nor hear me?""The witch made no reply. She walked up to the driver's seat, sat down and took up the reins. The exotic bird hopped up beside her and it chirruped, once, curiously.""Of course I have kept my word-to the letter,"" said the old woman, as if in reply. ""He shall be transformed back at the market meadow, so shall regain his own form before he comes to Wall. And after I have turned him back, I shall make you human again, for I still have to find a better servant than you are, silly slut. I could not have been doing with him underfoot all the livelong day, poking and prying and asking questions, and I'd've had to've fed him into the bargain, more than nuts and seeds."" She hugged herself tightly, and swayed back and forth. ""Oh, you'll have to get up pretty early in the morning to put one past me. And I do believe that that bumpkin's flower was even finer than the one you lost to me, all those years ago.""She clicked her tongue, and shook the reins, and the mules began to amble down the forest track.While the witch drove, Yvaine rested upon her musty bed. The caravan clacked and lurched its way through the forest. When it stopped, she would awake, and rise. While the witch slept Yvaine would sit on the roof of the caravan and look up at the stars. Sometimes the witch's bird would sit with her and then she would pet it and make a fuss of it, for it was good to have something about that acknowledged her existence. But when the witch was about, the bird ignored her utterly.Yvaine also cared for the dormouse, who spent most of his time fast asleep, curled up with his head between his paws. When the witch was off gathering firewood or fetching water, Yvaine would open up his cage, and stroke him, and talk to him, and, on several occasions, she sang to him, although she could not tell whether anything of Tristran remained in the dormouse, who stared up at her with placid, sleepy eyes, like droplets of black ink, and whose fur was softer than down.Her hip did not pain her, now that she was not walking every day, and her feet did not hurt her so much. She would always limp, she knew, for Tristran was no surgeon when it came to mending a broken bone although he had done the best he could. Meggot had acknowledged as much.When, as happened infrequently, they encountered other people, the star did her best to stay out of sight. However, she soon learned that, even should someone talk to her within the witch's hearing-should someone, as once a woodcutter did, point to her, and ask Madame Semele about her-the witch never seemed able to perceive Yvaine's presence, or even to hear anything pertaining to her existence.And so the weeks passed, in a rattling, bone-jarring sort of a way, in the witch's caravan, for the witch, and the bird, and the dormouse, and the fallen star.
ST_ch9	ST	Stardust	9	2966	16134	CHAPTER NINEWhich Deals Chiefly With the Events At Diggory's DykeDiggory's Dyke was a deep cut between two chalk Downs-high, green hills, where a thin layer of green grass and reddish earth covered the chalk, and there was scarcely soil enough for trees. The Dyke looked, from a distance, like a white chalk gash on a green velvet board. Local legend had it that the cut was dug, in a day and a night, by one Diggory, using a spade that had once been a sword blade before Wayland Smith had melted it down and beaten it out, on his journey into Faerie from Wall. There were those who said the sword had once been Flamberge, and others, that it was once the sword Balmung; but there were none who claimed to know just who Diggory had been, and it might all have been stuff and nonsense. Anyway, the path to Wall went through Diggory's Dyke, and any foot-traveler or any person going by any manner of wheeled vehicle went through the Dyke, where the chalk rose on either side of you like thick white walls, and the Downs rose up above them like the green pillows of a giant's bed.In the middle of the Dyke, beside the path, was what appeared at first glance to be little more than a heaped pile of sticks and twigs. A closer inspection would have revealed it to be something in nature partway between a small shed and a large wooden teepee, with a hole in the roof through which grey smoke occasionally could be seen to trickle out.The man in black had been giving the pile of sticks as close an inspection as he could for two days now, from the top of the Downs far above and, when he dared chance it, from closer. The hut, he had established, was inhabited by a woman of advanced years. She had no companions, and no obvious occupation, apart from that of stopping each and every lone traveler and each conveyance that passed through the Dyke, and passing the time of day.She seemed harmless enough, but Septimus had not become the only surviving male member of his immediate family by trusting appearances, and this old woman had, he was certain of it, slit Primus's throat.The obligations of revenge demanded a life for a life; they did not specify any way that the life should be taken. Now, by temperament, Septimus was one of nature's poisoners. Blades and blows and booby traps were well enough in their way, but a vial of clear liquid, any trace of taste or odor gone when it was admixtured with food, that was Septimus's metier.Unfortunately the old woman seemed to take no food she did not gather or trap herself, and while he contemplated leaving a steaming pie at the door to her house, made of ripe apples and lethal baneberries, he dismissed it soon enough as impractical. He pondered rolling a chalk boulder down from the hills above her, dropping it onto her little house; but he could not be certain that he would hit her with it. He wished he was more of a magician-he had some of the locating ability that ran, patchily, in his family line, and a few minor magics he had learned or stolen over the years, but nothing that would be of use to him now, when he needed to invoke floods or hurricanes or lightning strikes. So Septimus observed his victim-to-be as a cat watches a mouse hole, hour after hour, by night and by day.It was past the mid-hour of the night, and was quite moonless and dark, when Septimus finally crept to the door of the house of sticks, with a firepot in one hand and a book of romantic poetry and a blackbird's nest, into which he had placed several fircones, in the other. Hanging from his belt was a club of oak-wood, its head studded with brass nails. He listened at the door, but could hear nothing but a rhythmic breathing, and, once in a while, a sleeping grunt. His eyes were used to the darkness, and the house stood out against the white chalk of the Dyke. He crept around to the side of the building, where he could keep the door in sight.First he tore the pages from the book of poems, and crumpled each poem into a ball or a paper twist, which he pushed into the sticks of the shack's wall, at ground level. On top of the poems he placed the fircones. Next, he opened the firepot, and with his knife he fished a handful of waxed linen scraps from the lid, dipped them into the glowing charcoal of the pot and, when they were burning well, he placed them on the paper twists and the cones, and he blew gently on the flickering yellow flames until the pile caught. He dropped dry twigs from the bird's nest onto the little fire, which crackled in the night and began to blossom and grow. The dry sticks of the wall smoked gently, forcing Septimus to suppress a cough, and then they caught fire, and Septimus smiled.Septimus returned to the door of the hut, hefting his wooden club on high. For, he had reasoned, either the hag will burn with her house, in which case my task is done; or, she will smell the smoke and wake, affrighted and distracted, and she will run from the house, whereupon I shall beat her head with my club, staving it in before she can utter a word. And she will be dead, and I will be revenged.""It is a fine plan,"" said Tertius in the crackling of the dry wood. ""And once he has killed her, he can go on to obtain the Power of Stormhold.""""We shall see,"" said Primus, and his voice was the wail of a distant night bird.Flames licked at the little wooden house, and grew and blossomed on its sides with a bright yellow-orange flame. No one came to the door of the hut. Soon, the place was an inferno, and Septimus was forced to take several steps backwards, from the intensity of the heat. He smiled, widely and triumphantly, and he lowered his club.There came a sharp pain to the heel of his foot. He twisted, and saw a small bright-eyed snake, crimson in the fire's glow, with its fangs sunk deep into the back of his leather boot. He flung his club at it, but the little creature pulled back from his heel, and looped, at great speed, away behind one of the white chalk boulders.The pain in his heel began to subside. If there was poison in its bite, thought Septimus, the leather will have taken much of it. I shall bind my leg at the calf, and then I shall remove my boot, and make a cross-shaped incision in the place where I was bitten, and I shall suck out the serpent's venom. So thinking, he sat down upon a chalk boulder in the fire's light, and he tugged at his boot. It would not come off. His foot felt numb, and he realized that the foot must be swelling fast. Then I shall cut the boot off, he thought. He raised his foot to the level of his thigh; for a moment he thought his world was going dark, and then he saw that the flames, which had illuminated the Dyke like a bonfire, were gone. He felt chilled to the bone.""So,"" said a voice from behind him, soft as a silken strangling-rope, sweet as a poisoned lozenge, ""you thought that you would warm yourself at the burning of my little cottage. Did you wait at the door to beat out the flames should they prove not to my liking?""Septimus would have answered her, but his jaw muscles were clenched, his teeth gritted hard together. His heart was pounding inside his chest like a small drum, not in its usual steady march but in a wild, arrhythmic abandon. He could feel every vein and artery in his body threading fire through his frame, if it was not ice that they pumped: he could not tell.An old woman stepped into his view. She looked like the woman who had inhabited the wooden hut, but older, so much older. Septimus tried to blink, to clear his tearing eyes, but he had forgotten how to blink, and his eyes would not close.""You should be ashamed of yourself,"" said the woman. ""Attempting arson and violence upon the person of a poor old lady living upon her own, who would be entirely at the mercy of every passing vagabond, were it not for the kindness of her little friends.""And she picked something up from the chalky ground and placed it about her wrist, then she walked back into the hut, which was miraculously unburned, or restored, Septimus did not know which and did not care.His heart juddered and syncopated inside his chest, and if he could have screamed, he would. It was dawn before the pain ended and, in six voices, his older brothers welcomed Septimus to their ranks.Septimus looked down, one last time, on the twisted, still-warm form he had once inhabited, and at the expression in its eyes. Then he turned away.""There are no brothers left to take revenge on her,"" he said, in the voice of the morning curlews, ""and it is none of us will ever be Lord of Stormhold. Let us move on.""And after he had said that, there were not even ghosts in that place.The sun was high in the sky that day when Madame Semele's caravan came lumbering through the chalk cut of Diggory's Dyke.Madame Semele noticed the soot-blackened wooden hovel beside the road and, as she approached closer, the bent old woman in her faded scarlet dress, who waved at her from beside the path. The woman's hair was white as snow, her skin was wrinkled, and one eye was blind.""Good day, sister. What happened to your house?"" asked Madame Semele.""Young people today. One of them thought it would be good sport to fire the house of a poor old woman who has never harmed a soul. Well, he learned his lesson soon enough.""""Aye,"" said Madame Semele. ""They always learn. And are never grateful to us for the lesson.""""There's truth for you,"" said the woman in the faded scarlet dress. ""Now, tell me, dear. Who rides with you this day?""""That,"" said Madame Semele, haughtily, ""is none of your never-mind, and I shall thank you to keep yourself to yourself.""""Who rides with you? Tell me truly, or I shall set harpies to tear you limb from limb and hang your remains from a hook deep beneath the world.""""And who would you be, to threaten me so?""The old woman stared up at Madame Semele with one good eye and one milky eye. ""I know you, Ditchwater Sal. None of your damned lip. Who travels with you?Madame Semele felt the words being torn from her mouth, whether she would say them or no. ""There are the two mules who pull my caravan, myself, a maid-servant I keep in the form of a large bird, and a young man in the form of a dormouse.""""Anyone else? Anything else?""""No one and nothing. I swear it upon the Sisterhood.""The woman at the side of the road pursed her lips. ""Then get away with you, and get along with you,"" she said.Madame Semele clucked and shook the reins and the mules began to amble on.In her borrowed bed in the dark interior of the caravan the star slept on, unaware how close she had come to her doom, nor by how slim a margin she had escaped it.When they were out of sight of the stick-house and the deathly whiteness of Diggory's Dyke, the exotic bird napped up onto its perch, threw back its head and whooped and crowed and sang, until Madame Semele told it that she would wring its foolish neck if it would not be quiet. And even then, in the quiet darkness inside the caravan, the pretty bird chuckled and twittered and trilled, and, once, it even hooted like a little owl.The sun was already low in the western sky as they approached the town of Wall. The sun shone in their eyes, half blinding them and turning their world to liquid gold. The sky, the trees, the bushes, even the path itself was golden in the light of the setting sun.Madame Semele reined in her mules in the meadow, where her stall would be. She unhitched the two mules, and led them to the stream, where she hitched them to a tree. They drank deeply and eagerly.There were other market-folk and visitors setting up their stalls all over the meadow, putting up tents and hanging draperies from trees. There was an air of expectation that touched everyone and everything, like the golden light of the westering sun.Madame Semele went into the inside of the caravan and unhooked the cage from its chain. She carried it out into the meadow and put it down on a hillock of grass. She opened the cage door, and picked out the sleeping dormouse with bony fingers. ""Out you come,"" she said. The dormouse rubbed its liquid black eyes with its forepaws, and blinked at the fading daylight.The witch reached into her apron and produced a glass daffodil. With it she touched Tristran's head.Tristran blinked sleepily, and then he yawned. He ran a hand through his unruly brown hair and looked down at the witch with fierce anger in his eyes. ""Why, you evil old crone-"" he began.""Hush your silly mouth,"" said Madame Semele, sharply. ""I got you here, safely and soundly, and in the same condition I found you. I gave you board and I gave you lodging-and if neither of them were to your liking or expectation, well, what is it to me? Now, be off with you, before I change you into a wiggling worm and bite off your head, if it is not your tail. Go! Shoo! Shoo!""Tristran counted to ten, and then, ungraciously, walked away. He stopped a dozen yards away beside a copse, and waited for the star, who limped down the side of the caravan steps, and came over to him.""Are you all right?"" he asked, genuinely concerned, as she approached.""Yes, thank you,"" said the star. ""She did not ill-use me.Indeed, I do not believe that she ever knew that I was there at all. Is that not peculiar?""Madame Semele had the bird in front of her now. She touched its plumed head with her glass flower, and it flowed and shifted and became a young woman, in appearance not too much older than Tristran himself, with dark, curling hair and furred, catlike ears. She darted a glance at Tristran, and there was something about those violet eyes that Tristran found utterly familiar, although he could not recall where he had seen them before.""So, that is the bird's true form,"" said Yvaine. ""She was a good companion on the road."" And then the star realized that the silver chain that had kept the bird a captive was still there, now that the bird had become a woman, for it glinted upon her wrist and ankle, and Yvaine pointed this out to Tristran.""Yes,"" said Tristran. ""I can see. It is awful. But I'm not sure there's much that we can do about it.""They walked together through the meadow, toward the gap in the wall. ""We shall visit my parents first,"" said Tristran, ""For I have no doubt that they have missed me as I have missed them""-although, truth to tell, Tristran had scarcely given his parents a second thought on his journeyings-""and then we shall pay a visit to Victoria Forester, and-"" It was with this and that Tristran closed his mouth. For he could no longer reconcile his old idea of giving the star to Victoria Forester with his current notion that the star was not a thing to be passed from hand to hand, but a true person in all respects and no kind of a thing at all. And yet, Victoria Forester was the woman he loved.Well and all, he would burn that bridge when he came to it, he decided, and for now he would take Yvaine into the village, and deal with events as they came. He felt his spirits lift, and his time as a dormouse had already become nothing more in his head than the remnants of a dream, as if he had merely taken an afternoon nap in front of the kitchen fire and was now wide awake once more. He could almost taste in his mouth the memory of Mr. Bromios's best ale, although he realized, with a guilty start, he had forgotten the color of Victoria Forester's eyes.The sun was huge and red behind the rooftops of Wall when Tristran and Yvaine crossed the meadow and looked down on the gap in the wall. The star hesitated.""Do you really want this?"" she asked Tristran. ""For I have misgivings.""""Don't be nervous,"" he said. ""Although it's not surprising that you have nerves; my stomach feels as if I had swallowed a hundred butterflies. You shall feel so much better when you are sitting in my mother's parlor, drinking her tea-well, not drinking tea, but there will be tea for you to sip-why, I swear that for such a guest, and to welcome her boy back home, my mother would break out the best china,"" and his hand sought hers and gave it a reassuring squeeze.She looked at him, and she smiled, gently and ruefully. ""Whither thou goest..."" she whispered.Hand in hand the young man and the fallen star approached the gap in the wall.
ST_ch10	ST	Stardust	10	7687	42280	CHAPTER TENStardustIt has occasionally been remarked upon that it is as easy to overlook something large and obvious as it is to overlook something small and niggling, and that the large things one overlooks can often cause problems.Tristran Thorn approached the gap in the wall, from the Faerie side, for the second time since his conception eighteen years before, with the star limping beside him. His head was in a whirl from the scents and the sounds of his native village, and his heart rose within him. He nodded politely to the guards on the gap as he approached, recognizing them both. The young man shifting idly from foot to foot, sipping a pint of what Tristran supposed to be Mr. Bromios's best ale, was Wystan Pippin, who had once been Tristran's schoolfellow, although never his friend; while the older man, sucking irritably upon a pipe, which appeared to have gone out, was none other than Tristran's former employer at Monday and Brown's, Jerome Ambrose Brown, Esquire. The men had their backs to Tristran and Yvaine, and were resolutely facing the village as if they thought it sinful to observe the preparations occurring in the meadow behind them.""Good evening,"" said Tristran, politely, ""Wystan. Mister Brown.""The two men started. Wystan spilled his beer down the front of his jacket. Mr. Brown raised his staff and pointed the end of it at Tristran's chest, nervously. Wystan Pippin put down his ale, picked up his staff, and blocked the gap with it.""Stay where you are!"" said Mr. Brown, gesturing with the staff, as if Tristran were a wild beast that might spring at him at any moment.Tristran laughed. ""Do you not know me?"" he asked. ""It is me, Tristran Thorn.""But Mr. Brown, who was, Tristran knew, the senior of the guards, did not lower his staff. He looked Tristran up and down, from his worn brown boots to his mop of shaggy hair. Then he stared into Tristran's sun-browned face, and sniffed, unimpressed. ""Even if you are that good-for-nothing Thorn,"" he said, ""I see no reason to let either of you people through. We guard the wall, after all.""Tristran blinked. ""I, too, have guarded the wall,"" he pointed out. ""And there are no rules about not letting people through from this direction. Only from the village.""Mr. Brown nodded, slowly. Then he said, as one talks to an idiot, ""And if you are Tristran Thorn-which I'm only conceding for the sake of argument here, for you look nothing like him, and you talk little enough like him either-in all the years you lived here, how many people came through the wall from the meadow side?""""Why, none that ever I knew of,"" said Tristran.Mr. Brown smiled the same smile he had been used to use when he docked Tristran a morning's wages for five minutes' lateness. ""Exactly,"" he said. ""There was no rule against it because it doesn't happen. No one comes through from the other side. Not while I'm on duty, any road. Now, be off with you, before I take my stick to your head.""Tristran was dumbfounded. ""If you think I have gone through, well, everything I've gone through, only to be turned away at the last by a self-important, penny-pinching grocer and by someone who used to crib from me in History..."" he began, but Yvaine touched his arm and said, ""Tristran, let it go for now. You shall not fight with your own people.""Tristran said nothing. Then he turned, without a word, and together they walked back up the slope of the meadow. Around them a hodgepodge of creatures and people erected their stalls, hung their flags and wheeled their barrows. And it came to Tristran then, in a wave of something that resembled homesickness, but a homesickness comprised in equal parts of longing and despair, that these might as well be his own people, for he felt he had more in common with them than with the pallid folk of Wall in their worsted jackets and their hobnailed boots.They stopped and watched a small woman, almost as broad as she was high, do her best to put up her stall. Unasked, Tristran walked over and began to help her, carrying the heavy boxes from her cart to the stall, climbing a tall stepladder to hang an assortment of streamers from a tree branch, unpacking heavy glass carafes and jugs (each one stoppered with a huge, blackened cork and sealed with silvery wax, and filled with a slowly swirling colored smoke), and placing them on the shelves. As he and the market-woman worked, Yvaine sat on a nearby tree stump and she sang to them in her soft, clean voice the songs of the high stars, and the commoner songs she had heard and learnt from the folk they had encountered on their journeyings.By the time Tristran and the little woman were done, and the stall was set out for the morrow, they were working by lamplight. The woman insisted on feeding them; Yvaine barely managed to convince her that she was not hungry, but Tristran ate everything he was offered with enthusiasm and, unusually for him, he drank the greater part of a carafe of sweet canary wine, insisting that it tasted no stronger than freshly squeezed grape juice and that it had no effect upon him of any kind. Even so, when the stout little woman offered them the clearing behind her cart to sleep in, Tristran was sleeping drunkenly in moments.It was a clear, cold night. The star sat beside the sleeping man, who had once been her captor and had become her companion on the road, and she wondered where her hatred had gone. She was not sleepy.There was a rustle in the grass behind her. A dark-haired woman stood next to her, and together they stared down at Tristran.""There is something of the dormouse in him still,"" said the dark-haired woman. Her ears were pointed and catlike, and she looked little older than Tristran himself. ""Sometimes I wonder if she transforms people into animals, or whether she finds the beast inside us, and frees it. Perhaps there is something about me that is, by nature, a brightly colored bird. It is something to which I have given much thought, but about which I have come to no conclusions.""Tristran muttered something unintelligible, and stirred in his sleep. Then he began, gently, to snore.The woman walked around Tristran, and sat down beside him. ""He seems good-hearted,"" she said.""Yes,"" admitted the star. ""I suppose that he is.""""I should warn you,"" said the woman, ""that if you leave these lands for... over there..."" and she gestured toward the village of Wall with one slim arm, from the wrist of which a silver chain glittered, ""...then you will be, as I understand it, transformed into what you would be in that world: a cold, dead thing, sky-fallen.""The star shivered, but she said nothing. Instead, she reached across Tristran's sleeping form to touch the silver chain which circled the woman's wrist and ankle and led off into the bushes and beyond.""You become used to it, in time,"" said the woman.""Do you? Really?""Violet eyes stared into blue eyes, and then looked away. ""No.""The star let go of the chain. ""He once caught me with a chain much like yours. Then he freed me, and I ran from him. But he found me and bound me with an obligation, which binds my kind more securely than any chain ever could.""An April breeze ran across the meadow, stirring the bushes and the trees in one long chilly sigh. The cat-eared woman tossed her curly hair back from her face, and said,""You are under a prior obligation, are you not? You have something that does not belong to you, which you must deliver to its rightful owner.""The star's lips tightened. ""Who are you?"" she asked.""I told you. I was the bird in the caravan,"" said the woman. ""I know what you are, and I know why the witch-woman never knew that you were there. I know who seeks you and why she needs you. Also, I know the provenance of the topaz stone you wear upon a silver chain about your waist. Knowing this, and what manner of thing you are, I know the obligation you must be under."" She leaned down, and, with delicate fingers, she tenderly pushed the hair from Tristran's face. The sleeping youth neither stirred nor responded.""I do not think that I believe you, or trust you,"" said the star. A night bird cried in a tree above them. It sounded very lonely in the darkness.""I saw the topaz about your waist when I was a bird,"" said the woman, standing up once more. ""I watched, when you bathed in the river, and recognized it for what it was.""""How?"" asked the star. ""How did you recognize it?""But the dark-haired woman only shook her head and walked back the way that she had come, sparing but one last glance for the sleeping youth upon the grass. And then she was taken by the night.Tristran's hair had, obstinately, fallen across his face once more. The star leaned down and gently pushed it to one side, letting her fingers dwell upon his cheek as she did so. He slept on.Tristran was woken a little after sunrise by a large badger walking upon its hind legs and wearing a threadbare heliotrope silk dressing-gown, who snuffled into his ear until Tristran sleepily opened his eyes, and then said, self-importantly, ""Party name of Thorn? Tristran of that set?""""Mm?"" said Tristran. There was a foul taste in his mouth, which felt dry and furred. He could have slept for another several hours.""They've been asking about you,"" said the badger. ""Down by the gap. Seems there's a young lady wants to have a word with you.""Tristran sat up and grinned widely. He touched the sleeping star on her shoulder. She opened her sleepy blue eyes and said, ""What?""""Good news,"" he told her. ""Do you remember Victoria Forester? I might have mentioned her name once or twice on our travels.""""Yes,"" she said. ""You might have.""""Well,"" he said, ""I'm off to see her. She's down by the gap."" He paused. ""Look. Well. Probably best if you stay here. I wouldn't want to confuse her or anything.""The star rolled over and covered her head with her arm, and said nothing else. Tristran decided that she must have gone back to sleep. He pulled on his boots, washed his face and rinsed out his mouth in the meadow stream, and then ran pell-mell through the meadow, toward the village.The guards on the wall this morning were the Reverend Myles, the vicar of Wall, and Mr. Bromios, the innkeeper. Standing between them was a young lady with her back to the meadow.""Victoria!"" called Tristran in delight; but then the young lady turned, and he saw that it was not Victoria Forester (who, he remembered suddenly, and with delight in the knowing, had grey eyes. That was what they were: grey. How could he ever have allowed himself to forget?). But who this young lady could have been in her fine bonnet and shawl, Tristran could not say; although her eyes flooded with tears at the sight of him.""Tristran!"" she said. ""It is you! They said it was! Oh Tristran! How could you? Oh, how could you?"" and he realized who the young lady reproaching him must be.""Louisa?"" he said to his sister. And then, ""You have certainly grown while I was away, from a chit of a girl into a fine young lady.""She sniffed, and blew her nose into a lace-edged linen handkerchief, which she pulled from her sleeve. ""And you,"" she told him, dabbing at her cheeks with the handkerchief, ""have turned into a mop-haired raggle-taggle gypsy on your journeyings. But I suppose you look well, and that is a good thing. Come on, now,"" and she motioned, impatiently, for him to walk through the gap in the wall, and come to her.""But the wall-"" he said, eyeing the innkeeper and the vicar a little nervously.""Oh, as to that, when Wystan and Mister Brown finished their shift last night they repaired to the saloon bar at the Seventh Pie, where Wystan happened to mention their meeting with a ragamuffin who claimed to be you, and how they blocked his way. Your way. When news of this reached Father's ears, he marched right up to the Pie and gave the both of them such a tongue-lashing and a telling-of-what-for that I could scarcely believe it was him.""""Some of us were for letting you come back this morning,"" said the vicar, ""and some were for keeping you there until midday.""""But none of the ones who were for making you wait are on Wall duty this morning,"" said Mr. Bromios. ""Which took a certain amount of jiggery-pokery to organize-and on a day when I should have been seeing to the refreshment stand, I could point out. Still, it's good to see you back. Come on through."" And with that he stuck out his hand, and Tristran shook it with enthusiasm. Then Tristran shook the vicar's hand.""Tristran,"" said the vicar, ""I suppose that you must have seen many strange sights upon your travels.""Tristran reflected for a moment. ""I suppose I must have,"" he said.""You must come to the Vicarage, then, next week,"" said the vicar. ""We shall have tea, and you must tell me all about it. Once you're settled back in. Eh?"" And Tristran, who had always held the vicar in some awe, could do nothing but nod.Louisa sighed, a little theatrically, and began to walk, briskly, in the direction of the Seventh Magpie. Tristran ran along the cobbles to catch her up, and then he was walking beside her.""It does my heart good to see you again, my sister,"" he said.""As if we were not all worried sick about you,"" she said, crossly, ""what with all your gallivantings. And you did not even wake me to say good-bye. Father has been quite distracted with concern for you, and at Christmas, when you were not there, after we had eaten the goose and the pudding, Father took out the port and he toasted absent friends, and Mother sobbed like a babe, so of course I cried too, and then Father began to blow his nose into his best handkerchief and Grandmother and Grandfather Hempstock insisted upon pulling the Christmas crackers and reading the jolly mottoes and somehow that only made matters worse, and, to put it bluntly, Tristran, you quite spoiled our Christmas.""""Sorry,"" said Tristran. ""What are we doing now? Where are we going?""""We are going into the Seventh Pie"" said Louisa. ""I should have thought that was obvious.Mister Bromios said that you could use his sitting room. There's somebody there who needs to talk to you."" And she said nothing more as they went into the pub. There were a number of faces Tristran recognized, and the people nodded at him, or smiled, or did not smile, as he walked through the crowds and made his way up the narrow stairs behind the bar to the landing with Louisa by his side. The wooden boards creaked beneath their feet.Louisa glared at Tristran. And then her lip trembled, and, to Tristran's surprise, she threw her arms about him and hugged him so tightly that he could not breathe. Then, with not another word, she fled back down the wooden stairs.He knocked at the door to the sitting room, and went in. The room was decorated with a number of unusual objects, of small items of antique statuary and clay pots. Upon the wall hung a stick, wound about with ivy leaves, or rather, with a dark metal cunningly beaten to resemble ivy. Apart from the decorations the room could have been the sitting room of any busy bachelor with little time for sitting. It was furnished with a small chaise longue, a low table upon which was a well-thumbed leather-bound copy of the sermons of Laurence Sterne, a pianoforte, and several leather armchairs, and it was in one of these armchairs that Victoria Forester was sitting.Tristran walked over to her slowly and steadily, and then he went down upon one knee in front of her, as once he had gone down on his knees before her in the mud of a country lane.""Oh, please don't,"" said Victoria Forester, uncomfortably. ""Please get up. Why don't you sit down over there. In that chair? Yes. That's better."" The morning light shone through the high lace curtains and caught her chestnut hair from behind, framing her face in gold. ""Look at you,"" she said. ""You became a man. And your hand. What happened to your hand?""""I burnt it,"" he said. ""In a fire.""She said nothing in response, at first. She just looked at him. Then she sat back in the armchair, and looked ahead of her, at the stick on the wall, or one of Mr. Bromios's quaint old statues perhaps, and she said, ""There are a number of things I must tell you, Tristran, and none of them will be easy. I would appreciate it if you said nothing until I have had a chance to say my piece. So: firstly, and perhaps most importantly, I must apologize to you. It was my foolishness, my idiocy, that sent you off on your journeyings. I thought you were joking... no, not joking. I thought that you were too much the coward, too much of a boy, ever to follow up on any of your fine, silly words. It was only when you had gone, and the days passed, and you did not return, that I realized that you had been in earnest, and by then it was much too late.""I have had to live... each day... with the possibility that I had sent you to your death.""She stared ahead of herself as she spoke, and Tristranhad the feeling, which became a certainty, that she had conducted this conversation in her head a hundred times in his absence. It was why he could not be permitted to say anything; this was hard enough on Victoria Forester, and she would not be able to manage it if he caused her to depart from her script.""And I did not play you fair, my poor shop-boy... but you are no longer a shop-boy, are you? ...since I thought that your quest was just foolishness, in every way..."" She paused, and her hands gripped the wooden arms of the chair, grasping them so tightly her knuckles first reddened, then went white. ""Ask me why I would not kiss you that night, Tristran Thorn.""""It was your right not to kiss me,"" said Tristran. ""I did not come here to make you sad, Vicky. I did not find you your star to make you miserable.""Her head tipped to one side. ""So you did find the star we saw that night?""""Oh yes,"" said Tristran. ""The star is back in the meadow, though, right now. But I did what you asked me to do.""""Then do something else for me now. Ask me why I would not kiss you that night. I had kissed you before, when we were younger, after all.""""Very well, Vicky. Why would you not kiss me, that night?""""Because,"" she said, and there was relief in her voice as she said it, enormous relief, as if it were escaping from her, ""the day before we saw the shooting star, Robert had asked me to marry him. That evening, when I saw you, I had gone to the shop hoping to see him, and to talk to him, and to tell him that I accepted, and he should ask my father for my hand.""""Robert?"" asked Tristran, his head all in a whirl.""Robert Monday. You worked in his shop.""""Mister Monday?"" echoed Tristran. ""You and Mister Monday?""""Exactly."" She was looking at him now. ""And then you had to take me seriously and run off to bring me back a star, and not a day would go by when I did not feel as if I had done something foolish and bad. For I promised you my hand, if you returned with the star. And there were some days, Tristran, when I honestly do not know which I thought worse, that you would be killed in the Lands Beyond, all for the love of me, or that you would succeed in your madness, and return with the star, to claim me as your bride. Now, of course, some folks hereabouts told me not to take on so, and that it was inevitable that you would have gone off to the Lands Beyond, of course, it being your nature, and you being from there in the first place, but, somehow, in my heart, I knew I was at fault, and that, one day, you would return to claim me.""""And you love Mister Monday?"" said Tristran, seizing on the only thing in all this he was certain he had understood.She nodded, and raised her head, so her pretty chin pointed toward Tristran. ""But I gave you my word, Tristran. And I will keep my word, and I have told Robert this. I am responsible for all that you have gone through-even for your poor burned hand. And if you want me, then I am yours.""""To be honest,"" he said, ""I think that I am responsible for all that I have done, not you. And it is hard to regret a moment of it, although I missed soft beds from time to time, and I shall never be able to look at another dormouse in quite the same way ever again. But you did not promise me your hand if I came back with the star, Vicky."" ""I didn't?""""No. You promised me anything I desired."" Victoria Forester sat bolt upright then, and looked down at the floor. A red spot burned in each pale cheek, as if she had been slapped. ""Do I understand you to be-"" she began, but Tristran interrupted her. ""No,"" he said. ""I don't think you do, actually. You said you would give me whatever I desire."" ""Yes.""""Then..."" He paused. ""Then I desire that you should marry Mister Monday. I desire that you should be married as soon as possible-why, within this very week, if such a thing can be arranged. And I desire that you should be as happy together as ever a man and woman have ever been.""She exhaled in one low shuddering breath of release. Then she looked at him. ""Do you mean it?"" she asked.""Marry him with my blessing, and we'll be quits and done,"" said Tristran. ""And the star will probably think so, too.""There was a knock at the door. ""Is all well in there?"" called a man's voice.""Everything is very well,"" said Victoria. ""Please come in, Robert. You remember Tristran Thorn, do you not?""""Good morning, Mister Monday,"" said Tristran, and he shook Mr. Monday's hand, which was sweaty and damp. ""I understand that you are to be married soon. Permit me to tender my congratulations.""Mr. Monday grinned, though it made him look as if he had a toothache. Then he held out a hand for Victoria, and she rose from the chair.""If you wish to see the star, Miss Forester..."" said Tristran, but Victoria shook her head.""I am delighted that you came home safely, Mister Thorn. I trust that I shall see you at our wedding?""""I'm sure that nothing could give me greater pleasure than to be there,"" said Tristran, although he was sure of no such thing.On a normal day it would have been unheard-of for the Seventh Magpie to have been so crowded before breakfast, but this was market day, and the Wall-folk and the strangers were crowded into the bar, eating heaped plates of lambchops and bacon and mushrooms and fried eggs and black pudding.Dunstan Thorn was waiting for Tristran in the bar. He stood up when he saw him, walked over and clasped him on the shoulder, without speaking. ""So you made it back without hurt,"" he said, and there was pride in his voice.Tristran wondered if he had grown while he was away; he remembered his father as a bigger man. ""Hello Father,"" he said. ""I hurt my hand a bit.""""Your mother has breakfast waiting for you, back at the farm,"" said Dunstan.""Breakfast would be wonderful,"" admitted Tristran. ""And seeing Mother again, of course. Also we need to talk."" For his mind was still on something that Victoria Forester had said.""You look taller,"" said his father. ""And you are badly in need of a trip to the barber's."" He drained his tankard, and together they left the Seventh Magpie and walked out into the morning.The two Thorns climbed over a stile into one of Dunstan's fields, and, as they walked through the meadow in which he had played as a boy, Tristran raised the matter that had been vexing him, which was the question of his birth. His father answered him as honestly as he was able to during the long walk back to the farmhouse, telling his tale as if he were recounting a story that had happened a very long time ago, to someone else. A love story.And then they were at Tristran's old home, where his sister waited for him, and there was a steaming breakfast on the stove and on the table, prepared for him, lovingly, by the woman he had always believed to be his mother.Madame Semele adjusted the last of the crystal flowers on the stall, and eyed the market with disfavor. It was a little past noon, and the customers had just started to wander through. None of them had yet stopped at her stall.""Fewer of them and fewer of them, every nine-year,"" she said. ""Mark my words, soon enough this market will be just a memory. There's other markets, and other marketplaces, I am thinking. This market's time is almost over. Another forty, fifty, sixty years at the most, and it will be done for good.""""Perhaps,"" said her violet-eyed servant, ""but it does not matter to me. This is the last of these markets I shall ever attend.""Madame Semele glared at her. ""I thought I had long since beaten all of your insolence out of you.""""It is not insolence,"" said her slave. ""Look."" She held up the silver chain which bound her. It glinted in the sunlight, but still, it was thinner, more translucent than ever it had been before; in places it seemed as if it were made not of silver but of smoke.""What have you done?"" Spittle flecked the old woman's lips.""I have done nothing; nothing that I did not do eighteen years ago. I was bound to you to be your slave until the day that the moon lost her daughter, if it occurred in a week when two Mondays came together. And my time with you is almost done.""It was after three in the afternoon. The star sat upon the meadow grass beside Mr. Bromios's wine-and-ale-and-food stall, and stared across at the gap in the wall and the village beyond it. Upon occasion, the patrons of the stall would offer her wine or ale or great, greasy sausages, and always she would decline.""Are you waiting for someone, my dear?"" asked a pleasant-featured young woman, as the afternoon dragged on.""I do not know,"" said the star. ""Perhaps.""""A young man, if I do not mistake my guess, a lovely thing like you.""The star nodded. ""In a way,"" she said.""I'm Victoria,"" said the young woman. ""Victoria Forester.""""I am called Yvaine,"" said the star. She looked Victoria Forester up and down and up again. ""So,"" she said, ""you are Victoria Forester. Your fame precedes you.""""The wedding, you mean?"" said Victoria, and her eyes shone with pride and delight.""A wedding, is it?"" asked Yvaine. One hand crept to her waist, and felt the topaz, upon its silver chain. Then she stared at the gap in the wall, and bit her lip.""Oh you poor thing! What a beast he must be, to keep you waiting so!"" said Victoria Forester. ""Why do you not go through, and look for him?""""Because..."" said the star, and then she stopped. ""Aye,"" she said. ""Perhaps I shall."" The sky above them was striped with grey and white bands of cloud, through which patches of blue could be seen. ""I wish my mother were out,"" said the star. ""I would say good-bye to her, first."" And, awkwardly, she got to her feet.But Victoria was not willing to let her new friend go that easily, and she was prattling on about banns, and marriage licenses, and special licenses which could only be issued by archbishops, and how lucky she was that Robert knew the archbishop. The wedding, it seemed, was set for six days' time, at midday.Then Victoria called over a respectable gentleman, greying at the temples, who was smoking a black cheroot and who grinned as if he had the toothache. ""And this is Robert,"" she said. ""Robert, this is Yvaine. She's waiting for her young man. Yvaine, this is Robert Monday. And on Friday next, at midday, I shall be Victoria Monday. Perhaps you could make something of that, my dear, in your speech at the wedding breakfast-that on Friday there will be two Mondays together!""And Mr. Monday puffed on his cheroot, and told his bride-to-be that he would certainly consider it.""Then,"" asked Yvaine, picking her words with care, ""you are not marrying Tristran Thorn?""""No,"" said Victoria.""Oh,"" said the star. ""Good."" And she sat down again.She was still sitting there when Tristran came back through the gap in the wall, several hours later. He looked distracted, but brightened up when he saw her. ""Hello, you,"" he said, helping her to her feet. ""Have a good time waiting for me?""""Not particularly,"" she said.""I'm sorry,"" said Tristran. ""I suppose I should have taken you with me, into the village.""""No,"" said the star, ""You shouldn't have. I live as long as I am in Faerie. Were I to travel to your world, I would be nothing but a cold iron stone fallen from the heavens, pitted and pocked.""""But I almost took you through with me!"" said Tristan, aghast. ""I tried to, last night.""""Yes,"" she said. ""Which only goes to prove that you are indeed a ninny, a lackwit, and a... a clodpoll.""""Dunderhead,"" offered Tristran. ""You always used to like calling me a dunderhead. And an oaf.""""Well,"" she said, ""you are all those things, and more besides. Why did you keep me waiting like that? I thought something terrible had happened to you.""""I'm sorry,"" he told her. ""I won't leave you again.""""No,"" she said, seriously and with certainty, ""you will not.""His hand found hers, then. They walked, hand in hand, through the market. A wind began to come up, flapping and gusting at the canvas of the tents and the flags, and a cold rain spat down on them. They took refuge under the awning of a book stall, along with a number of other people and creatures. The stallholder hauled a boxful of books further under the canvas, to ensure that it did not get wet.""Mackerel sky, mackerel sky, not long wet nor not long dry,"" said a man in a black silk top hat to Tristran and Yvaine. He was purchasing a small book bound in red leather from the bookseller.Tristran smiled and nodded, and, as it became apparent that the rain was easing up, he and Yvaine walked on.""Which is all the thanks I shall ever get from them, I'll wager,"" said the tall man in the top hat to the bookseller, who had not the slightest idea what he was speaking about, and did not care.""I have said my good-byes to my family,"" said Tristran to the star, as they walked. ""To my father, and my mother-my father's wife, perhaps I should say-and to my sister, Louisa. I don't think I shall be going back again. Now we just need to solve the problem of how to put you back up again in the sky. Perhaps I shall come with you.""""You would not like it, up in the sky,"" the star assured him. ""So... I take it you will not be marrying Victoria Forester.""Tristran nodded. ""No,"" he said.""I met her,"" said the star. ""Did you know that she is with child?""""What?"" asked Tristran, shocked and surprised.""I doubt that she knows. She is one, perhaps two moons along.""""Good lord. How do you know?""It was the star's turn to shrug. ""You know,"" she said, ""I was happy to discover that you are not marrying Victoria Forester.""""So was I,"" he confessed.The rain began once more, but they made no move to get under cover. He squeezed her hand in his. ""You know,"" she said, ""a star and a mortal man...""""Only half mortal, actually,"" said Tristran, helpfully. ""Everything I ever thought about myself- who I was, what I am- was a lie. Or sort of. You have no idea how astonishingly liberating that feels.""""Whatever you are,"" she said, ""I just wanted to point out that we can probably never have children. That's all.""Tristran looked at the star, then, and he began to smile, and he said nothing at all. His hands were on her upper arms. He was standing in front of her, and looking down at her.""Just so you know, that's all,"" said the star, and she leaned forward.They kissed for the first time then in the cold spring rain, though neither one of them now knew that it was raining. Tristran's heart pounded in his chest as if it were not big enough to contain all the joy that it held. He opened his eyes as he kissed the star. Her sky-blue eyes stared back into his, and in her eyes he could see no parting from her.The silver chain was now nothing but smoke and vapor. For a heartbeat it hung on the air, then a sharp gust of wind and rain blew it out into nothing at all.""There,"" said the woman with the dark, curling hair, stretching like a cat, and smiling. ""The terms of my servitude are fulfilled, and now you and I are done with each other.""The old woman looked at her helplessly. ""But what shall I do? I am old. I cannot manage this stall by myself. You are an evil, foolish slattern, so to desert me like this.""""Your problems are of no concern to me,"" said her former slave, ""but I shall never again be called a slattern, or a slave, or anything else that is not my own name. I am Lady Una, firstborn and only daughter of the eighty-first Lord of Stormhold, and the spells and terms you bound me with are over and done. Now, you will apologize to me, and you will call me by my right name, or I will-with enormous pleasure- devote the rest of my life to hunting you down and destroying every thing that you care for and every thing that you are.""They looked at each other, then, and it was the old woman who looked away first.""Then I must apologize for having called you a slattern, Lady Una,"" she said, as if each word of it were bitter sawdust that she spat from her mouth.Lady Una nodded. ""Good. And I believe that you owe me payment for my services, now my time with you is done,"" she said. For these things have their rules. All things have rules.The rain was still falling in gusts, then not falling for just long enough to lure people out from underneath their makeshift shelters, then raining on them once more. Tristran and Yvaine sat, damp and happy, beside a campfire, in the company of a motley assortment of creatures and people.Tristran had asked if any of them knew the little hairy man he had met upon his travels, and had described him as well as he could. Several people acknowledged that they had met him in the past, although none had seen him at this market.He found his hands twining, almost of their own volition, into the star's wet hair. He wondered how it could have taken him so long to realize how much he cared for her, and he told her so, and she called him an idiot, and he declared that it was the finest thing that ever a man had been called.""So, where are we going once the market is done?"" Tristran asked the star.""I do not know,"" she said. ""But I have one obligation still to discharge.""""You do?""""Yes,"" she said. ""The topaz thing I showed you. I have to give it to the right person. The last time the right person came along, that innkeeper woman cut his throat, so I have it still. But I wish it were gone.""A woman's voice at his shoulder said, ""Ask her for what she carries, Tristran Thorn.""He turned, and stared into eyes the color of meadow-violets. ""You were the bird in the witch's caravan,"" he told the woman.""When you were the dormouse, my son,"" said the woman. ""I was the bird. But now I have my own form again, and my time of servitude is over. Ask Yvaine for what she carries. You have the right.""He turned back to the star. ""Yvaine?""She nodded, waiting.""Yvaine, will you give me what you are carrying?""She looked puzzled; then she reached inside her robe, fumbled discreetly, and produced a large topaz stone on a broken silver chain.""It was your grandfather's,"" said the woman to Tristran. ""You are the last male of the line of Stormhold. Put it about your neck.""Tristran did so; as he touched the ends of the silver chain together they knit and mended as if they had never been broken. ""It's very nice,"" said Tristran, dubiously.""It is the Power of Stormhold,"" said his mother. ""There's no one can argue with that. You are of the blood, and all of your uncles are dead and gone. You will make a fine Lord of Stormhold.""Tristran stared at her in honest puzzlement. ""But I have no wish to be a lord of anywhere,"" he told her, ""or of anything, except perhaps my lady's heart."" And he took the star's hand in his, and he pressed it to his breast, and smiled.The woman flicked her ears impatiently. ""In almost eighteen years, Tristran Thorn, I have not demanded one single thing of you. And now, the first simple little request that I make-the tiniest favor that I ask of you-you say me no. Now, I ask of you, Tristran, is that any way to treat your mother?""""No, Mother,"" said Tristran.""Well,"" she continued, slightly mollified, ""and I think it will do you young people good to have a home of your own, and for you to have an occupation. And if it does not suit you, you may leave, you know. There is no silver chain that will be holding you to the throne of Stormhold.""And Tristran found this quite reassuring. Yvaine was less impressed, for she knew that silver chains come in all shapes and sizes; but she knew also that it would not be wise to begin her life with Tristran by arguing with his mother.""Might I have the honor of knowing what you are called?"" asked Yvaine, wondering if she was laying it on a bit thickly. Tristran's mother preened, and Yvaine knew that she was not. ""I am the Lady Una of Stormhold,"" she said. Then she reached into a small bag, which hung from her side, and produced a rose made of glass, of a red so dark that it was almost black in the flickering firelight. ""It was my payment,"" she said. ""For more than sixty years of servitude. It galled her to give it to me, but rules are rules, and she would have lost her magic and more if she had not settled up. Now, I plan to barter it for a palanquin to take us back to the Stormhold, for we must arrive in style. Oh, I have missed the Stormhold so badly. We must have bearers, and outriders, and perhaps an elephant- they are so imposing, nothing says 'Get out of the way' quite like an elephant in the front..."" ""No,"" said Tristran. ""No?"" said his mother.""No,"" repeated Tristran. ""You may travel by palanquin, and elephant, and camel and all that, if you wish to, Mother. But Yvaine and I will make our own way there, and travel at our own speed.""The Lady Una took a deep breath, and Yvaine decided that this argument was one that she would rather be somewhere else for, so she stood up, and told them that she would be back soon, that she needed a walk, and that she would not go wandering too far. Tristran looked at her with pleading eyes, but Yvaine shook her head: this was his fight to win, and he would fight it better if she were not there.She limped through the darkening market, pausing beside a tent from which music and applause could be heard, and from which light spilled like warm, golden honey. She listened to the music, and she thought her own thoughts. It was there that a bent, white-haired old woman, glaucousblind in one eye, hobbled over to the star, and bade her to stop a while and talk.""About what?"" asked the star.The old woman, shrunk by age and time to little bigger than a child, held onto a stick as tall and bent as herself with palsied and swollen-knuckled hands. She stared up at the star with her good eye and her blue-milk eye, and she said, ""I came to fetch your heart back with me.""""Is that so?"" asked the star.""Aye,"" said the old woman. ""I nearly had it, at that, up in the mountain pass."" She cackled at the back of her throat at the memory. ""D'ye remember?"" She had a large pack that sat like a hump on her back. A spiral ivory horn protruded from the pack, and Yvaine knew where she had seen that horn before.""That was you?"" asked the star of the tiny woman. ""You, with the knives?""""Mm. That was me. But I squandered away all the youth I took for the journey. Every act of magic lost me a little of the youth I wore, and now I am older than I have ever been.""""If you touch me,"" said the star, ""lay but a finger on me, you will regret it forevermore.""""If ever you get to be my age,"" said the old woman, ""you will know all there is to know about regrets, and you will know that one more, here or there, will make no difference in the long run."" She snuffled the air. Her dress had once been red, but it seemed to have been much patched and taken up and faded over the years. It hung down from one shoulder, exposing a puckered scar that might have been many hundreds of years old. ""So what I want to know is why it is that I can no longer find you, in my mind. You are still there, just, but you are there like a ghost, a will o' the wisp. Not long ago you burned-your heart burned-in my mind like silver fire. But after that night in the inn it became patchy and dim, and now it is not there at all.""Yvaine realized that she felt nothing but pity for the creature who had wanted her dead, so she said, ""Could it be that the heart that you seek is no longer my own?""The old woman coughed. Her whole frame shook and spasmed with the retching effort of it.The star waited for her to be done, and then she said, ""I have given my heart to another.""""The boy? The one in the inn? With the unicorn?""""Yes.""""You should have let me take it back then, for my sisters and me. We could have been young again, well into the next age of the world. Your boy will break it, or waste it, or lose it. They all do.""""Nonetheless,"" said the star, ""he has my heart. I hope that your sisters will not be too hard on you, when you return to them without it.""It was then that Tristran walked across to Yvaine, and took her hand, and nodded to the old woman. ""All sorted out,"" he said. ""Nothing to worry about.""""And the palanquin?""""Oh, Mother will be traveling by palanquin. I had to promise that we'd get to the Stormhold sooner or later, but we can take our time on the way. I think we should buy a couple of horses, and see the sights.""""And your mother acceded to this?""""In the end,"" he said blithely. ""Anyway, sorry to interrupt.""""We are almost done,"" said Yvaine, and she turned back to the little old woman.""My sisters will be harsh, but cruel,"" said the old witch-queen. ""However, I appreciate the sentiment. You have a good heart, child. A pity it will not be mine.""The star leaned down, then, and kissed the old woman on her wizened cheek, feeling the rough hairs on it scrape her soft lips.Then the star and her true love walked away, toward the wall. ""Who was the old biddy?"" asked Tristran. ""She seemed a bit familiar. Was anything wrong?""""Nothing was wrong,"" she told him. ""She was just someone I knew from the road.""Behind them were the lights of the market, the lanterns and candles and witch-lights and fairy glitter, like a dream of the night sky brought down to earth. In front of them, across the meadow, on the other side of the gap in the wall, now guardless, was the town of Wall. Oil lamps and gas lamps and candles glowed in the windows of the houses of the village. To Tristran, then, they seemed as distant and unknowable as the world of the Arabian Nights.He looked upon the lights of Wall for what he knew (it came to him then with certainty) was the last time. He stared at them for some time and said nothing, the fallen star by his side. And then he turned away, and together they began to walk toward the East.
TGB_ch1	TGB	The graveyard book	1	6397	35349	CHAPTER ONE - How Nobody Came to the GraveyardTHERE WAS A HAND IN the darkness, and it held a knife.The knife had a handle of polished black bone, and a blade finer and sharper than any razor. If it sliced you, you might not even know you had been cut, not immediately.The knife had done almost everything it was brought to that house to do, and both the blade and the handle were wet.The street door was still open, just a little, where the knife and the man who held it had slipped in, and wisps of nighttime mist slithered and twined into the house through the open door.The man Jack paused on the landing. With his left hand he pulled a large white handkerchief from the pocket of his black coat, and with it he wiped off the knife and his gloved right hand which had been holding it; then he put the handkerchief away. The hunt was almost over. He had left the woman in her bed, the man on the bedroom floor, the older child in her brightly colored bedroom, surrounded by toys and half-finished models. That only left the little one, a baby barely a toddler, to take care of. One more and his task would be done.He flexed his fingers. The man Jack was, above all things, a professional, or so he told himself, and he would not allow himself to smile until the job was completed.His hair was dark and his eyes were dark and he wore black leather gloves of the thinnest lambskin.The toddler's room was at the very top of the house. The man Jack walked up the stairs, his feet silent on the carpeting. Then he pushed open the attic door, and he walked in. His shoes were black leather, and they were polished to such a shine that they looked like dark mirrors: you could see the moon reflected in them, tiny and half full.The real moon shone through the casement window. Its light was not bright, and it was diffused by the mist, but the man Jack would not need much light. The moonlight was enough. It would do.He could make out the shape of the child in the crib, head and limbs and torso.The crib had high, slatted sides to prevent the child from getting out. Jack leaned over, raised his right hand, the one holding the knife, and he aimed for the chest......and then he lowered his hand. The shape in the crib was a teddy bear. There was no child.The man Jack's eyes were accustomed to the dim moonlight, so he had no desire to turn on an electric light. And light was not that important, after all. He had other skills.The man Jack sniffed the air. He ignored the scents that had come into the room with him, dismissed the scents that he could safely ignore, honed in on the smell of the thing he had come to find. He could smell the child: a milky smell, like chocolate chip cookies, and the sour tang of a wet, disposable, nighttime diaper. He could smell the baby shampoo in its hair, and something small and rubbery-a toy, he thought, and then, no, something to suck-that the child had been carrying.The child had been here. It was here no longer. The man Jack followed his nose down the stairs through the middle of the tall, thin house. He inspected the bathroom, the kitchen, the airing cupboard, and, finally, the downstairs hall, in which there was nothing to be seen but the family's bicycles, a pile of empty shopping bags, a fallen diaper, and the stray tendrils of fog that had insinuated themselves into the hall from the open door to the street.The man Jack made a small noise then, a grunt that contained in it both frustration and also satisfaction. He slipped the knife into its sheath in the inside pocket of his long coat, and he stepped out into the street. There was moonlight, and there were streetlights, but the fog stifled everything, muted light and muffled sound and made the night shadowy and treacherous. He looked down the hill towards the light of the closed shops, then up the street, where the last high houses wound up the hill on their way to the darkness of the old graveyard.The man Jack sniffed the air. Then, without hurrying, he began to walk up the hill.Ever since the child had learned to walk he had been his mother's and father's despair and delight, for there never was such a boy for wandering, for climbing up things, for getting into and out of things. That night, he had been woken by the sound of something on the floor beneath him falling with a crash. Awake, he soon became bored, and had begun looking for a way out of his crib. It had high sides, like the walls of his playpen downstairs, but he was convinced that he could scale it. All he needed was a step...He pulled his large, golden teddy bear into the corner of the crib, then, holding the railing in his tiny hands, he put his foot onto the bear's lap, the other foot up on the bear's head, and he pulled himself up into a standing position, and then he half-climbed, half-toppled over the railing and out of the crib.He landed with a muffled thump on a small mound of furry, fuzzy toys, some of them presents from relations from his first birthday, not six months gone, some of them inherited from his older sister. He was surprised when he hit the floor, but he did not cry out: if you cried they came and put you back in your crib.He crawled out of the room.Stairs that went up were tricky things, and he had not yet entirely mastered them. Stairs that went down however, he had discovered, were fairly simple. He did them sitting down, bumping from step to step on his well-padded bottom.He sucked on his nummer, the rubber pacifier his mother had just begun to tell him that he was getting too old for.His diaper had worked itself loose on his journey on his bottom down the stairs, and when he reached the last step, when he reached the little hall and stood up, the diaper fell off. He stepped out of it. He was only wearing a child's nightshirt. The stairs that led back up to his room and his family were steep, but the door to the street was open and inviting....The child stepped out of the house a little hesitantly. The fog wreathed around him like a long-lost friend. And then, uncertainly at first, then with increasing speed and confidence, the boy tottered up the hill.The fog was thinner as you approached the top of the hill. The half-moon shone, not as bright as day, not by any means, but enough to see the graveyard, enough for that.Look.You could see the abandoned funeral chapel, iron doors padlocked, ivy on the sides of the spire, a small tree growing out of the guttering at roof level.You could see stones and tombs and vaults and memorial plaques. You could see the occasional dash or scuttle of a rabbit or a vole or a weasel as it slipped out of the undergrowth and across the path.You would have seen these things, in the moonlight, if you had been there that night.You might not have seen a pale, plump woman, who walked the path near the front gates, and if you had seen her, with a second, more careful glance you would have realized that she was only moonlight, mist, and shadow. The plump, pale woman was there, though. She walked the path that led through a clutch of half-fallen tombstones towards the front gates.The gates were locked. They were always locked at four in the afternoon in winter, at eight at night in summer. Spike-topped iron railings ran around part of the cemetery, a high brick wall around the rest of it. The bars of the gates were closely spaced: they would have stopped a grown man from getting through, even stopped a ten-year-old child...""Owens!"" called the pale woman, in a voice that might have been the rustle of the wind through the long grass. ""Owens! Come and look at this!""She crouched down and peered at something on the ground, as a patch of shadow moved into the moonlight, revealing itself to be a grizzled man in his mid-forties. He looked down at his wife, and then looked at what she was looking at, and he scratched his head.""Mistress Owens?"" he said, for he came from a more formal age than our own. ""Is that what I think it is?""And at that moment the thing he was inspecting seemed to catch sight of Mrs. Owens, for it opened its mouth, letting the rubber nipple it was sucking fall to the ground, and it reached out a small, chubby fist, as if it were trying for all the world to hold on to Mrs. Owens's pale finger.""Strike me silly,"" said Mr. Owens, ""if that isn't a baby.""""Of course it's a baby,"" said his wife. ""And the question is, what is to be done with it?""""I daresay that is a question, Mistress Owens,"" said her husband. ""And yet, it is not our question. For this here baby is unquestionably alive, and as such is nothing to do with us, and is no part of our world.""""Look at him smile!"" said Mrs. Owens. ""He has the sweetest of smiles,"" and with one insubstantial hand she stroked the child's sparse blond hair. The little boy giggled with delight.A chilly breeze blew across the graveyard, scattering the fog in the lower slopes of the place (for the graveyard covered the whole of the top of the hill, and its paths wound up the hill and down and back upon themselves). A rattling: someone at the main gate of the graveyard was pulling and shaking it, rattling the old gates and the heavy padlock and chain that held them.""There now,"" said Owens, ""it's the babe's family, come to bring him back to the loving bosom. Leave the little man be,"" he added, because Mrs. Owens was putting her insubstantial arms around the toddler, smoothing, stroking.Mrs. Owens said, ""He dun't look like nobody's family, that one."" The man in the dark coat had given up on rattling the main gates and was now examining the smaller side gate. It, too, was well-locked. There had been some vandalism in the graveyard the previous year, and the council had Taken Steps.""Come on, Mistress Owens. Leave it be. There's a dear,"" said Mr. Owens, when he saw a ghost, and his mouth dropped open, and he found himself unable to think of anything to say.You might think-and if you did, you would be right-that Mr. Owens should not have taken on so at seeing a ghost, given that Mr. and Mrs. Owens were themselves dead and had been for a few hundred years now, and given that the entirety of their social life, or very nearly, was spent with those who were also dead. But there was a difference between the folk of the graveyard and this: a raw, flickering, startling shape the grey color of television static, all panic and naked emotion which flooded the Owenses as if it was their own. Three figures, two large, one smaller, but only one of them was in focus, was more than an outline or a shimmer. And the figure said, My baby! He is trying to harm my baby!A clattering. The man outside was hauling a heavy metal garbage can across the alley to the high brick wall that ran around that part of the graveyard.""Protect my son!"" said the ghost, and Mrs. Owens thought it was a woman. Of course, the babe's mother.""What did he do to you?"" asked Mrs. Owens, but she was not certain that the ghost could hear her. Recently dead, poor love, she thought. It's always easier to die gently, to wake in due time in the place you were buried, to come to terms with your death and to get acquainted with the other inhabitants. This creature was nothing but alarm and fear for her child, and her panic, which felt to the Owenses like a low-pitched screaming, was now attracting attention, for other pale figures were coming from all over the graveyard.""Who are you?"" Caius Pompeius asked the figure. His headstone was now only a weathered lump of rock, but two thousand years earlier he had asked to be laid to rest on the mound beside the marble shrine, rather than to have his body sent back to Rome, and he was one of the most senior citizens of the graveyard. He took his responsibilities extremely seriously. ""Are you buried here?""""Of course she's not! Freshly dead by the look of her."" Mrs. Owens put an arm around the woman-shape and spoke to it privately, in a low voice, calm and sensible.There was a thump and a crash from the high wall beside the alley. The garbage can had fallen. A man clambered up onto the top of the wall, a dark outline against the mist-smudged streetlights. He paused for a moment, then climbed down the other side, holding on to the top of the wall, legs dangling, then let himself fall the last few feet, down into the graveyard.""But my dear,"" Mrs. Owens said to the shape, now all that was left of the three shapes that had appeared in the graveyard. ""He's living. We're not. Can you imagine...""The child was looking up at them, puzzled. It reached for one of them, then the other, finding nothing but air. The woman-shape was fading fast.""Yes,"" said Mrs. Owens, in response to something that no one else had heard. ""If we can, then we will."" Then she turned to the man beside her. ""And you, Owens? Will you be a father to this little lad?""""Will I what?"" said Owens, his brow crinkling.""We never had a child,"" said his wife. ""And his mother wants us to protect him. Will you say yes?""The man in the black coat had tripped in the tangle of ivy and half-broken headstones. Now he got to his feet and walked forward more carefully, startling an owl which rose on silent wings. He could see the baby and there was triumph in his eyes.Owens knew what his wife was thinking when she used that tone of voice. They had not, in life and in death, been married for over two hundred and fifty years for nothing. ""Are you certain?"" he asked. ""Are you sure?""""Sure as I ever have been of anything,"" said Mrs. Owens.""Then yes. If you'll be its mother, I'll be its father.""""Did you hear that?"" Mrs. Owens asked the flickering shape in the graveyard, now little more than an outline, like distant summer lightning in the shape of a woman. It said something to her that no one else could hear, and then it was gone.""She'll not come here again,"" said Mr. Owens. ""Next time she wakes it'll be in her own graveyard, or wherever it is she's going.""Mrs. Owens bent down to the baby and extended her arms. ""Come now,"" she said, warmly. ""Come to Mama.""To the man Jack, walking through the graveyard towards them on a path, his knife already in his hand, it seemed as if a swirl of mist had curled around the child, in the moonlight, and that the boy was no longer there: just damp mist and moonlight and swaying grass.He blinked and sniffed the air. Something had happened, but he had no idea what it was. He growled in the back of his throat, like a beast of prey, angry and frustrated.""Hullo?"" called the man Jack, wondering if perhaps the child had stepped behind something. His voice was dark and rough, and there was an odd edge to it, as if of surprise or puzzlement at hearing himself speak.The graveyard kept its secrets.""Hello?"" he called, again. He hoped to hear a baby cry or utter a half-word, or to hear it move. He did not expect what he actually heard, a voice, silky smooth, saying,""Can I help you?""The man Jack was tall. This man was taller. The man Jack wore dark clothes. This man's clothes were darker. People who noticed the man Jack when he was about his business-and he did not like to be noticed-were troubled, or made uncomfortable, or found themselves unaccountably scared. The man Jack looked up at the stranger, and it was the man Jack who was troubled.""I was looking for someone,"" said the man Jack, slipping his right hand back into his coat pocket, so the knife was hidden, but there if he needed it.""In a locked graveyard, at night?"" said the stranger.""It was just a baby,"" said the man Jack. ""I was just passing, when I heard a baby cry, and I looked through the gates and I saw him. Well, what would anyone do?""""I applaud your public-spiritedness,"" said the stranger. ""Yet if you managed to find this child, how were you planning to get out of here with it? You can't climb back over the wall holding a baby.""""I would have called until someone let me out,"" said the man Jack.A heavy jingling of keys. ""Well, that would have been me, then,"" said the stranger. ""I would have had to let you out."" He selected one large key from the key ring, said ""Follow me.""The man Jack walked behind the stranger. He took his knife from his pocket. ""Are you the caretaker, then?""""Am I? Certainly, in a manner of speaking,"" said the stranger. They were walking towards the gates and, the man Jack was certain, away from the baby. But the caretaker had the keys. A knife in the dark, that was all it would take, and then he could search for the child all through the night, if he needed to.He raised the knife.""If there was a baby,"" said the stranger, without looking back, ""it wouldn't have been here in the graveyard. Perhaps you were mistaken. It's unlikely that a child would have come in here, after all. Much more likely that you heard a nightbird, and saw a cat, perhaps, or a fox. They declared this place an official nature reserve, you know, thirty years ago, around the time of the last funeral. Now think carefully, and tell me you are certain that it was a child that you saw.""The man Jack thought.The stranger unlocked the side gate. ""A fox,"" he said. ""They make the most uncommon noises, not unlike a person crying. No, your visit to this graveyard was a mis-step, sir. Somewhere the child you seek awaits you, but he is not here."" And he let the thought sit there, in the man Jack's head for a moment, before he opened the gate with a flourish. ""Delighted to have made your acquaintance,"" he said. ""And I trust that you will find everything you need out there.""The man Jack stood outside the gates to the graveyard. The stranger stood inside the gate, and he locked it again, and put the key away.""Where are you going?"" asked the man Jack.""There are other gates than this,"" said the stranger. ""My car is on the other side of the hill. Don't mind me. You don't even have to remember this conversation.""""No,"" said the man Jack, agreeably. ""I don't."" He remembered wandering up the hill, that what he had thought to be a child had turned out to be a fox, that a helpful caretaker had escorted him back out to the street. He slipped his knife into its inner sheath. ""Well,"" he said. ""Good night.""""A good night to you,"" said the stranger whom Jack had taken for a caretaker.The man Jack set off down the hill, in pursuit of the infant.From the shadows, the stranger watched Jack until he was out of sight. Then he moved through the night, up and up, to the flat place below the brow of the hill, a place dominated by an obelisk and a flat stone set into the ground dedicated to the memory of Josiah Worthington, local brewer, politician and later baronet, who had, almost three hundred years before, bought the old cemetery and the land around it, and given it to the city in perpetuity. He had reserved for himself the best location on the hill-a natural amphitheater, with a view of the whole city and beyond-and had insured that the graveyard endured as a graveyard, for which the inhabitants of the graveyard were grateful, although never quite as grateful as Josiah Worthington, Bart., felt they should have been.There were, all told, some ten thousand souls in the graveyard, but most of them slept deep, or took no interest in the night-to-night affairs of the place, and there were less than three hundred of them up there, in the amphitheater, in the moonlight.The stranger reached them as silently as the fog itself, and he watched the proceedings unfold, from the shadows, and he said nothing.Josiah Worthington was speaking. He said, ""My dear madam. Your obduracy is quite, is...well, can't you see how ridiculous this is?""""No,"" said Mrs. Owens. ""I can't.""She was sitting, cross-legged, on the ground, and the living child was sleeping in her lap. She cradled its head with her pale hands.""What Mistress Owens is trying to say, sir, begging your honor's pardon,"" said Mr. Owens, standing beside her, ""is that she dun't see it that way. She sees it as doing her duty.""Mr. Owens had seen Josiah Worthington in the flesh back when they were both alive, had in fact made several pieces of fine furniture for the Worthington manor house, out near Inglesham, and was still in awe of him.""Her duty?"" Josiah Worthington, Bart., shook his head, as if to dislodge a strand of cobweb. ""Your duty, ma'am, is to the graveyard, and to the commonality of those who form this population of discarnate spirits, revenants and suchlike wights, and your duty thus is to return the creature as soon as possible to its natural home-which is not here.""""His mama gave the boy to me,"" said Mrs. Owens, as if that was all that needed to be said.""My dear woman...""""I am not your dear woman,"" said Mrs. Owens, getting to her feet. ""Truth to tell, I don't even see why I am even here, talking to you fiddle-pated old dunderheads, when this lad is going to wake up hungry soon enough-and where am I going to find food for him in this graveyard, I should like to know?""""Which,"" said Caius Pompeius, stiffly, ""is precisely the point. What will you feed him? How can you care for him?""Mrs. Owens's eyes burned. ""I can look after him,"" she said, ""as well as his own mama. She already gave him to me. Look: I'm holding him, aren't I? I'm touching him.""""Now, see reason, Betsy,"" said Mother Slaughter, a tiny old thing, in the huge bonnet and cape that she had worn in life and been buried wearing. ""Where would he live?""""Here,"" said Mrs. Owens. ""We could give him the Freedom of the Graveyard.""Mother Slaughter's mouth became a tiny O. ""But,"" she said. Then she said, ""But I never.""""Well, why not? It en't the first time we'd've given the Freedom of the Graveyard to an outsider.""""That is true,"" said Caius Pompeius. ""But he wasn't alive.""And with that, the stranger realized that he was being drawn, like it or not, into the conversation and, reluctantly, he stepped out of the shadows, detaching from them like a patch of darkness. ""No,"" he agreed. ""I am not. But I take Mrs. Owens's point.""Josiah Worthington said, ""You do, Silas?""""I do. For good or for evil-and I firmly believe that it is for good-Mrs. Owens and her husband have taken this child under their protection. It is going to take more than just a couple of good-hearted souls to raise this child. It will,"" said Silas, ""take a graveyard.""""And what of food, and the rest of it?""""I can leave the graveyard and return. I can bring him food,"" said Silas.""That's all very well you saying that,"" said Mother Slaughter. ""But you comes and you goes and nobody keeps track of you. If you went off for a week, the boy could die.""""You are a wise woman,"" said Silas. ""I see why they speak so highly of you."" He couldn't push the minds of the dead as he could the living, but he could use all the tools of flattery and persuasion he possessed, for the dead are not immune to either. Then he came to a decision. ""Very well. If Mr. and Mrs. Owens will be his parents, I shall be his guardian. I shall remain here, and if I need to leave I shall ensure that someone takes my place, bringing the child food and looking after him. We can use the crypt of the chapel,"" he added.""But,"" expostulated Josiah Worthington. ""But. A human child. A living child. I mean. I mean, I mean. This is a graveyard, not a nursery, blast it.""""Exactly,"" said Silas, nodding. ""A very good point, Sir Josiah. I couldn't have put it better myself. And for that reason, if for no other, it is vital that the child be raised with as little disruption as possible to the, if you'll forgive the expression, the life of the graveyard."" With that he strolled over to Mrs. Owens, and he looked down at the infant asleep in her arms. He raised an eyebrow. ""Does he have a name, Mrs. Owens?""""Not that his mother told me,"" she said.""Well, then,"" said Silas. ""His old name won't be of much use to him now, anyway. There are those out there who mean him harm. Suppose we pick a name for him, eh?""Caius Pompeius stepped over and eyed the child. ""He looks a little like my proconsul, Marcus. We could call him Marcus.""Josiah Worthington said, ""He looks more like my head gardener, Stebbins. Not that I'm suggesting Stebbins as a name. The man drank like a fish.""""He looks like my nephew Harry,"" said Mother Slaughter, and it seemed then as if the whole graveyard was about to join in, each inhabitant offering his or her own comparisons between the infant and someone long forgotten, when Mrs. Owens broke in.""He looks like nobody but himself,"" said Mrs. Owens, firmly. ""He looks like nobody.""""Then Nobody it is,"" said Silas. ""Nobody Owens.""It was then that, as if responding to the name, the child opened its eyes wide in wakefulness. It stared around it, taking in the faces of the dead, and the mist, and the moon. Then it looked at Silas. Its gaze did not flinch. It looked grave.""And what kind of a name is Nobody?"" asked Mother Slaughter, scandalized.""His name. And a good name,"" Silas told her. ""It will help to keep him safe.""""I don't want trouble,"" said Josiah Worthington. The infant looked up at him and then, hungry or tired or simply missing his home, his family, his world, he screwed up his tiny face and began to cry.""Leave us,"" said Caius Pompeius to Mrs. Owens. ""We will discuss this further without you.""Mrs. Owens waited outside the funeral chapel. It had been decreed over forty years before that the building, in appearance a small church with a spire, was a listed building of historical interest. The town council had decided that it would cost too much to renovate it, a little chapel in an overgrown graveyard that had already become unfashionable, so they had padlocked it, and waited for it to fall down. Ivy covered it, but it was solidly built, and it would not fall down this century.The child had fallen asleep in Mrs. Owens's arms. She rocked it gently, sang to it an old song, one her mother had sung to her when she was a baby herself, back in the days when men had first started to wear powdered wigs. The song went,Sleep my little babby-ohSleep until you wakenWhen you're grown you'll see the worldIf I'm not mistaken.Kiss a lover,Dance a measure,Find your nameand buried treasure...And Mrs. Owens sang all that before she discovered that she had forgotten how the song ended. She had a feeling that the final line was something in the way of ""and some hairy bacon,"" but that might have been another song altogether, so she stopped and instead she sang him the one about the Man in the Moon who came down too soon, and after that she sang, in her warm country voice, a more recent song about a lad who put in his thumb and pulled out a plum, and she had just started a long ballad about a young country gentleman whose girlfriend had, for no particular reason, poisoned him with a dish of spotted eels, when Silas came around the side of the chapel, carrying a cardboard box.""Here we go, Mistress Owens,"" he said. ""Lots of good things for a growing boy. We can keep it in the crypt, eh?""The padlock fell off in his hand and he pulled open the iron door. Mrs. Owens walked inside, looking dubiously at the shelves, and at the old wooden pews tipped up against a wall. There were mildewed boxes of old parish records in one corner, and an open door that revealed a Victorian flush toilet and a basin, with only a cold tap, in the other.The infant opened his eyes and stared.""We can put the food here,"" said Silas. ""It's cool, and the food will keep longer."" He reached into the box, pulled out a banana.""And what would that be when it was at home?"" asked Mrs. Owens, eyeing the yellow and brown object suspiciously.""It's a banana. A fruit, from the tropics. I believe you peel off the outer covering,"" said Silas, ""like so.""The child-Nobody-wriggled in Mrs. Owens's arms, and she let it down to the flagstones. It toddled rapidly to Silas, grasped his trouser-leg and held on.Silas passed it the banana.Mrs. Owens watched the boy eat. ""Ba-na-na,"" she said, dubiously. ""Never heard of them. Never. What's it taste like?""""I've absolutely no idea,"" said Silas, who consumed only one food, and it was not bananas. ""You could make up a bed in here for the boy, you know.""""I'll do no such thing, with Owens and me having a lovely little tomb over by the daffodil patch. Plenty of room in there for a little one. Anyway,"" she added, concerned that Silas might think she was rejecting his hospitality, ""I wouldn't want the lad disturbing you.""""He wouldn't.""The boy was done with his banana. What he had not eaten was now smeared over himself. He beamed, messy and apple-cheeked.""Narna,"" he said, happily.""What a clever little thing he is,"" said Mrs. Owens. ""And such a mess he's made! Why, attend, you little wriggler..."" and she picked the lumps of banana from his clothes and his hair. And then, ""What do you think they'll decide?""""I don't know.""""I can't give him up. Not after what I promised his mama.""""Although I have been a great many things in my time,"" said Silas, ""I have never been a mother. And I do not plan to begin now. But I can leave this place...""Mrs. Owens said simply, ""I cannot. My bones are here. And so are Owens's. I'm never leaving.""""It must be good,"" said Silas, ""to have somewhere that you belong. Somewhere that's home."" There was nothing wistful in the way he said this. His voice was drier than deserts, and he said it as if he were simply stating something unarguable. Mrs. Owens did not argue.""Do you think we will have long to wait?""""Not long,"" said Silas, but he was wrong about that.Up in the amphitheater on the side of the hill, the debate continued. That it was the Owenses who had got involved in this nonsense, rather than some flibbertigibbet johnny-come-latelies, counted for a lot, for the Owenses were respectable and respected. That Silas had volunteered to be the boy's guardian had weight-Silas was regarded with a certain wary awe by the graveyard folk, existing as he did on the borderland between their world and the world they had left. But still, but still...A graveyard is not normally a democracy, and yet death is the great democracy, and each of the dead had a voice, and an opinion as to whether the living child should be allowed to stay, and they were each determined to be heard, that night.It was late autumn when the daybreak was long in coming. Although the sky was still dark, cars could now be heard starting up further down the hill, and as the living folk began to drive to work through the misty night-black morning, the graveyard folk talked about the child that had come to them, and what was to be done. Three hundred voices. Three hundred opinions. Nehemiah Trot, the poet, from the tumbled northwestern side of the graveyard, had begun to declaim his thoughts on the matter, although what they were no person listening could have said, when something happened; something to silence each opinionated mouth, something unprecedented in the history of that graveyard.A huge white horse, of the kind that the people who know horses would call a ""grey,"" came ambling up the side of the hill. The pounding of its hooves could be heard before it was seen, along with the crashing it made as it pushed through the little bushes and thickets, through the brambles and the ivy and the gorse that had grown up on the side of the hill. The size of a Shire horse it was, a full nineteen hands or more. It was a horse that could have carried a knight in full armor into combat, but all it carried on its naked back was a woman, clothed from head to foot in grey. Her long skirt and her shawl might have been spun out of old cobwebs.Her face was serene, and peaceful.They knew her, the graveyard folk, for each of us encounters the Lady on the Grey at the end of our days, and there is no forgetting her.The horse paused beside the obelisk. In the east the sky was lightening gently, a pearlish, pre-dawn luminescence that made the people of the graveyard uncomfortable and made them think about returning to their comfortable homes. Even so, not a one of them moved. They were watching the Lady on the Grey, each of them half-excited, half-scared. The dead are not superstitious, not as a rule, but they watched her as a Roman Augur might have watched the sacred crows circle, seeking wisdom, seeking a clue.And she spoke to them.In a voice like the chiming of a hundred tiny silver bells she said only, ""The dead should have charity."" And she smiled.The horse, which had been contentedly ripping up and masticating a clump of thick grass, stopped then. The lady touched the horse's neck, and it turned. It took several huge, clattering steps, then it was off the side of the hill and cantering across the sky. Its thunderous hooves became an early rumble of distant thunder, and in moments it was lost to sight.That, at least, was what the folk of the graveyard who had been on the hillside that night claimed had happened.The debate was over and ended, and, without so much as a show of hands, had been decided. The child called Nobody Owens would be given the Freedom of the Graveyard.Mother Slaughter and Josiah Worthington, Bart., accompanied Mr. Owens to the crypt of the old chapel, and they told Mrs. Owens the news.She seemed unsurprised by the miracle. ""That's right,"" she said. ""Some of them dun't have a ha'porth of sense in their heads. But she does. Of course she does.""Before the sun rose on a thundering grey morning the child was fast asleep in the Owenses' fine little tomb (for Master Owens had died the prosperous head of the local cabinetmaker's guild, and the cabinetmakers had wanted to ensure that he was properly honored).Silas went out for one final journey before the sunrise. He found the tall house on the side of the hill, and he examined the three bodies he found there, and he studied the pattern of the knife-wounds. When he was satisfied he stepped out into the morning's dark, his head churning with unpleasant possibilities, and he returned to the graveyard, to the chapel spire where he slept and waited out the days.In the little town at the bottom of the hill the man Jack was getting increasingly angry. The night had been one that he had been looking forward to for so long, the culmination of months-of years-of work. And the business of the evening had started so promisingly-three people down before any of them had even had a chance to cry out. And then...Then it had all gone so maddeningly wrong. Why on earth had he gone up the hill when the child had so obviously gone down the hill? By the time he had reached the bottom of the hill, the trail had gone cold. Someone must have found the child, taken it in, hidden it. There was no other explanation.A crack of thunder rang out, loud and sudden as a gunshot, and the rain began in earnest. The man Jack was methodical, and he began to plan his next move-the calls he would need to pay on certain of the townsfolk, people who would be his eyes and ears in the town.He did not need to tell the Convocation he had failed.Anyway, he told himself, edging under a shopfront as the morning rain came down like tears, he had not failed. Not yet. Not for years to come. There was plenty of time. Time to tie up this last piece of unfinished business. Time to cut the final thread.It was not until the police sirens sounded and first a police car, then an ambulance, then an unmarked police car with a siren blaring, sped past him on their way up the hill that, reluctantly, the man Jack turned up the collar of his coat, put his head down, and walked off into the morning. His knife was in his pocket, safe and dry inside its sheath, protected from the misery of the elements.
TGB_ch2	TGB	The graveyard book	2	5478	30856	CHAPTER TWO - The New FriendBOD WAS A QUIET child with sober grey eyes and a mop of tousled, mouse-colored hair. He was, for the most part, obedient. He learned how to talk, and, once he had learned, he would pester the graveyard folk with questions. ""Why amn't I allowed out of the graveyard?"" he would ask, or ""How do I do what he just did?"" or ""Who lives in here?"" The adults would do their best to answer his questions, but their answers were often vague, or confusing, or contradictory, and then Bod would walk down to the old chapel and talk to Silas.He would be there waiting at sunset, just before Silas awakened.His guardian could always be counted upon to explain matters clearly and lucidly and as simply as Bod needed in order to understand.""You aren't allowed out of the graveyard-it's aren't, by the way, not amn't, not these days-because it's only in the graveyard that we can keep you safe. This is where you live and this is where those who love you can be found. Outside would not be safe for you. Not yet.""""You go outside. You go outside every night.""""I am infinitely older than you, lad. And I am safe wherever I am.""""I'm safe there too.""""I wish that that were true. But as long as you stay here, you are safe.""Or,""How could you do that? Some skills can be attained by education, and some by practice, and some by time. Those skills will come if you study. Soon enough you will master Fading and Sliding and Dreamwalking. But some skills cannot be mastered by the living, and for those you must wait a little longer. Still, I do not doubt that you will acquire even those, in time.""You were given the Freedom of the Graveyard, after all,"" Silas would tell him. ""So the Graveyard is taking care of you. While you are here, you can see in the darkness. You can walk some of the ways that the living should not travel. The eyes of the living will slip from you. I too was given the Freedom of the Graveyard, although in my case it comes with nothing but the right of abode.""""I want to be like you,"" said Bod, pushing out his lower lip.""No,"" said Silas, firmly. ""You do not.""Or,""Who lies there? You know, Bod, in many cases it is written on the stone. Can you read yet? Do you know your alphabet?""""My what?""Silas shook his head, but said nothing. Mr. and Mrs. Owens had never been much for reading when they were alive, and there were no alphabet books in the graveyard.The next night, Silas appeared at the front of the Owenses' cozy tomb carrying three large books-two of them brightly colored alphabet books (A is for Apple, B is for Ball) and a copy of The Cat in the Hat. He also had paper and a packet of wax crayons. Then he walked Bod around the graveyard, placing the boy's small fingers on the newest and clearest of the headstones and the plaques, and taught Bod how to find the letters of the alphabet when they appeared, beginning with the sharp steeple of the capital A.Silas gave Bod a quest-to find each of the twenty-six letters in the graveyard-and Bod finished it, proudly, with the discovery of Ezekiel Ulmsley's stone, built into the side of the wall in the old chapel. His guardian was pleased with him.Every day Bod would take his paper and crayons into the graveyard and he would copy names and words and numbers as best he could, and each night, before Silas would go off into the world, Bod would make Silas explain to him what he had written, and make him translate the snatches of Latin which had, for the most part, baffled the Owenses.A sunny day: bumblebees explored the wildflowers that grew in the corner of the graveyard, dangling from the gorse and the bluebells, droning their deep lazy buzz, while Bod lay in the spring sunlight watching a bronze-colored beetle wandering across the stone of Geo. Reeder, his wife, Dorcas, and their son Sebastian (Fidelis ad Mortem). Bod had copied down their inscription and now he was only thinking about the beetle when somebody said,""Boy? What're you doing?""Bod looked up. There was someone on the other side of the gorse bush, watching him.""Nuffing,"" said Bod. He stuck out his tongue.The face on the other side of the gorse bush crumpled into a gargoyle, tongue sticking out, eyes popping, then returned to girl.""That was good,"" said Bod, impressed.""I can make really good faces,"" said the girl. ""Look at this one."" She pushed her nose up with one finger, creased her mouth into a huge, satisfied smile, squinted her eyes, puffed out her cheeks. ""Do you know what that was?""""No.""""It was a pig, silly.""""Oh."" Bod thought. ""You mean, like P is for Pig?""""Of course like that. Hang on.""She came around the gorse bush and stood next to Bod, who got to his feet. She was a little older than he was, a little taller, and was dressed in bright colors, yellow and pink and orange. Bod, in his grey winding sheet, felt dowdy and drab.""How old are you?"" said the girl. ""What are you doing here? Do you live here? What's your name?""""I don't know,"" said Bod.""You don't know your name?"" said the girl. ""'Course you do. Everybody knows their own name. Fibber.""""I know my name,"" said Bod. ""And I know what I'm doing here. But I don't know the other thing you said.""""How old you are?""Bod nodded.""Well,"" said the girl, ""what was you when you was last birthday?""""I didn't,"" said Bod. ""I never was.""""Everybody gets birthdays. You mean you never had cake or candles or stuff?""Bod shook his head. The girl looked sympathetic. ""Poor thing. I'm five. I bet you're five too.""Bod nodded enthusiastically. He was not going to argue with his new friend. She made him happy.Her name was Scarlett Amber Perkins, she told him, and she lived in a flat with no garden. Her mother was sitting on a bench by the chapel at the bottom of the hill, reading a magazine, and she had told Scarlett to be back in half an hour, and to get some exercise, and not to get into trouble or talk to strangers.""I'm a stranger,"" pointed out Bod.""You're not,"" she said, definitely. ""You're a little boy."" And then she said, ""And you're my friend. So you can't be a stranger.""Bod smiled rarely, but he smiled then, hugely and with delight. ""I'm your friend,"" he said.""What's your name?""""Bod. It's short for Nobody.""She laughed then. ""Funny sort of a name,"" she said. ""What are you doing now?""""ABCs,"" said Bod. ""From the stones. I have to write them down.""""Can I do it with you?""For a moment Bod felt protective-the gravestones were his, weren't they?-and then he realized how foolish he was being, and he thought that there were things that might be more fun done in the sunlight with a friend. He said, ""Yes.""They copied down names from tombstones, Scarlett helping Bod pronounce unfamiliar names and words, Bod telling Scarlett what the Latin meant, if he already knew, and it seemed much too soon when they heard a voice further down the hill shouting, ""Scarlett!""The girl thrust the crayons and paper back at Bod. ""I got to go,"" she said.""I'll see you next time,"" said Bod. ""Won't I?""""Where do you live?"" she asked.""Here,"" he said. And he stood and watched her as she ran down the hill.On the way home Scarlett told her mother about the boy called Nobody who lived in the graveyard and had played with her, and that night Scarlett's mother mentioned it to Scarlett's father, who said that he believed that imaginary friends were a common phenomenon at that age, and nothing at all to be concerned about, and that they were fortunate to have a nature reserve so near.After that initial meeting, Scarlett never saw Bod first. On days when it was not raining one of her parents would bring her to the graveyard. The parent would sit on the bench and read while Scarlett would wander off the path, a splash of fluorescent green or orange or pink, and explore. Then, always sooner rather than later, she would see a small, grave face and grey eyes staring up at her from beneath a mop of mouse-colored hair, and then Bod and she would play-hide-and-seek, sometimes, or climbing things, or being quiet and watching the rabbits behind the old chapel.Bod would introduce Scarlett to some of his other friends. That she could not see them did not seem to matter. She had already been told firmly by her parents that Bod was imaginary and that there was nothing at all wrong with that-her mother had, for a few days, even insisted on laying an extra place at the dinner table for Bod-so it came as no surprise to her that Bod also had imaginary friends. He would pass on their comments to her.""Bartleby says that thou dost have a face like unto a squishèd plum,"" he would tell her.""So does he. And why does he talk so funny? Doesn't he mean squashed tomato?""""I don't think that they had tomatoes when he comes from,"" said Bod. ""And that's just how they talk then.""Scarlett was happy. She was a bright, lonely child, whose mother worked for a distant university teaching people she never met face-to-face, grading English papers sent to her over the computer, and sending messages of advice or encouragement back. Her father taught particle physics, but there were, Scarlett told Bod, too many people who wanted to teach particle physics and not enough people who wanted to learn it, so Scarlett's family had to keep moving to different university towns, and in each town her father would hope for a permanent teaching position that never came.""What's particle physics?"" asked Bod.Scarlett shrugged. ""Well,"" she said. ""There's atoms, which is things that is too small to see, that's what we're all made of. And there's things that's smaller than atoms, and that's particle physics.""Bod nodded and decided that Scarlett's father was probably interested in imaginary things.Bod and Scarlett wandered the graveyard together every weekday afternoon, tracing names with their fingers, writing them down. Bod would tell Scarlett whatever he knew of the inhabitants of the grave or mausoleum or tomb, and she would tell him stories that she had been read or learned, and sometimes she would tell him about the world outside, about cars and buses and television and aeroplanes (Bod had seen them flying high overhead, had thought them loud silver birds, but had never been curious about them until now). He in his turn would tell her about the days when the people in the graves had been alive-how Sebastian Reeder had been to London Town and had seen the Queen, who had been a fat woman in a fur cap who had glared at everyone and spoke no English. Sebastian Reeder could not remember which queen she had been, but he did not think she had been queen for very long.""When was this?"" Scarlett asked.""He died in 1583, it says on his tombstone, so before then.""""Who is the oldest person here. In the whole graveyard?"" asked Scarlett.Bod frowned. ""Probably Caius Pompeius. He came here a hundred years after the Romans first got here. He told me about it. He liked the roads.""""So he's the oldest?""""I think so.""""Can we make a little house in one of those stone houses?""""You can't get in. It's locked. They all are.""""Can you get in?""""Of course.""""Why can't I?""""The graveyard,"" he explained. ""I got the Freedom of the Graveyard. It lets me go places.""""I want to go in the stone house and make little houses.""""You can't.""""You're just mean.""""Not.""""Meany.""""Not.""Scarlett put her hands into the pocket of her anorak and walked down the hill without saying good-bye, convinced that Bod was holding out on her, and at the same time suspecting that she was being unfair, which made her angrier.That night, over dinner, she asked her mother and father if there was anyone in the country before the Romans came.""Where did you hear about the Romans?"" asked her father.""Everybody knows,"" said Scarlett, with withering scorn. ""Was there?""""There were Celts,"" said her mother. ""They were here first. They go back before the Romans. They were the people that the Romans conquered.""On the bench beside the old chapel, Bod was having a similar conversation.""The oldest?"" said Silas. ""Honestly, Bod, I don't know. The oldest in the graveyard that I've encountered is Caius Pompeius. But there were people here before the Romans came. Lots of them, going back a long time. How are your letters coming along?""""Good, I think. When do I learn joined-up letters?""Silas paused. ""I have no doubt,"" he said, after a moment's reflection, ""that there are, among the many talented individuals interred here, at least a smattering of teachers. I shall make inquiries.""Bod was thrilled. He imagined a future in which he could read everything, in which all stories could be opened and discovered.When Silas had left the graveyard to go about his own affairs, Bod walked to the willow tree beside the old chapel, and called Caius Pompeius.The old Roman came out of his grave with a yawn. ""Ah. Yes. The living boy,"" he said. ""How are you, living boy?""Bod said, ""I do very well, sir.""""Good. I am pleased to hear it."" The old Roman's hair was pale in the moonlight, and he wore the toga in which he had been buried, with, beneath it, a thick woolen vest and leggings because this was a cold country at the edge of the world, and the only place colder was Caledonia to the North, where the men were more animal than human and covered in orange fur, and were too savage even to be conquered by the Romans, so would soon be walled off in their perpetual winter.""Are you the oldest?"" asked Bod.""The oldest in the graveyard? I am.""""So you were the first to be buried here?""A hesitation. ""Almost the first,"" said Caius Pompeius. ""Before the Celts there were other people on this island. One of them was buried here.""""Oh."" Bod thought for a moment. ""Where's his grave?""Caius pointed up the hill.""He's up at the top,"" said Bod.Caius shook his head.""Then what?""The old Roman reached down and he ruffled Bod's hair. ""In the hill,"" he said. ""Inside it. I was first brought here by my friends, followed in their turn by the local officials and the mimes, who wore the wax faces of my wife, taken by a fever in Camulodonum, and my father, killed in a border skirmish in Gaul. Three hundred years after my death a farmer, seeking a new place to graze his sheep, discovered the boulder that covered the entrance, and rolled it away, and went down, thinking there might be treasure. He came out a little later, his dark hair now as white as mine...""""What did he see?""Caius said nothing, then, ""He would not speak of it. Or ever return. They put the boulder back, and in time, they forgot. And then, two hundred years ago, when they were building the Frobisher vault, they found it once more. The young man who found the place dreamed of riches, so he told no one, and he hid the doorway behind Ephraim Pettyfer's casket, and went down one night, unobserved, or so he thought.""""Was his hair white when he came up?""""He did not come up.""""Um. Oh. So, who is buried down there?""Caius shook his head. ""I do not know, young Owens. But I felt him, back when this place was empty. I could feel something waiting even then, deep in the hill.""""What was he waiting for?""""All I could feel,"" said Caius Pompeius, ""was the waiting.""Scarlett was carrying a large picture book, and she sat next to her mother on the green bench near the gates, and she read her book while her mother inspected an educational supplement. She enjoyed the spring sunshine and she did her best to ignore the small boy who waved at her first from behind an ivy-covered monument, then, when she had resolved to no longer look at the monument, the boy popped up-literally, like a jack-in-a-box-from behind a tombstone (Joji G. Shoji, d. 1921, I was a stranger and you took me in). He gestured towards her, frantically. She ignored him.Eventually she put her book down on the bench.""Mummy? I'm going for a walk, now.""""Stay on the path, dear.""She stayed on the path until she was round the corner, and she could see Bod waving at her from further up the hill. She made a face at him.""I've found things out,"" said Scarlett.""Me too,"" said Bod.""There were people before the Romans,"" she said. ""Way back. They lived, I mean, when they died they put them underground in these hills, with treasure and stuff. And they were called barrows.""""Oh. Right,"" said Bod. ""That explains it. Do you want to come and see one?""""Now?"" Scarlett looked doubtful. ""You don't really know where one is, do you? And you know I can't always follow you where you go."" She had seen him slip through walls, like a shadow.In reply, he held up a large, rusted, iron key. ""This was in the chapel,"" he said. ""It should open most of the gates up there. They used the same key for all of them. It was less work.""She scrambled up the hillside beside him.""You're telling the truth?""He nodded, a pleased smile dancing at the corners of his lips. ""Come on,"" he said.It was a perfect spring day, and the air was alive with birdsong and bee hum. The daffodils bustled in the breeze and here and there on the side of the hill a few early tulips nodded. A blue powdering of forget-me-nots and fine, fat yellow primroses punctuated the green of the slope as the two children walked up the hill toward the Frobishers' little mausoleum.It was old and simple in design, a small, forgotten stone house with a metal gate for a door. Bod unlocked the gate with his key, and they went in.""It's a hole,"" said Bod. ""Or a door. Behind one of the coffins.""They found it behind a coffin on the bottom shelf-a simple crawl space. ""Down there,"" said Bod. ""We go down there.""Scarlett found herself suddenly enjoying the adventure rather less. She said, ""We can't see down there. It's dark.""""I don't need light,"" said Bod. ""Not while I'm in the graveyard.""""I do,"" said Scarlett. ""It's dark.""Bod thought about the reassuring things that he could say, like ""there's nothing bad down there,"" but the tales of hair turning white and people never returning meant that he could not have said them with a clear conscience, so he said, ""I'll go down. You wait for me up here.""Scarlett frowned. ""You shouldn't leave me,"" she said.""I'll go down,"" said Bod, ""and I'll see who's there, and I'll come back and tell you all about it.""He turned to the opening, bent down, and clambered through on his hands and knees. He was in a space big enough to stand up in, and he could see steps cut into the stone. ""I'm going down the steps now,"" he said.""Do they go down a long way?""""I think so.""""If you held my hand and told me where I was walking,"" she said, ""then I could come with you. If you make sure I'm okay.""""Of course,"" said Bod, and before he had finished speaking the girl was coming through the hole on her hands and her knees.""You can stand up,"" Bod told her. He took her hand. ""The steps are just here. If you put a foot forward you can find it. There. Now I'll go first.""""Can you really see?"" she asked.""It's dark,"" said Bod. ""But I can see.""He began to lead Scarlett down the steps, deep into the hill, and to describe what he saw to her as they went. ""It's steps down,"" he said. ""Made of stone. And there's stone all above us. Someone's made a painting on the wall.""""What kind of painting?""""A big hairy C is for Cow, I think. With horns. Then something that's more like a pattern, like a big knot. It's sort of carved in the stone too, not just painted, see?"" and he took her fingers and placed them onto the carved knot-work.""I can feel it!"" she said.""Now the steps are getting bigger. We are coming out into some kind of big room, now, but the steps are still going. Don't move. Okay, now I am between you and the room. Keep your left hand on the wall.""They kept going down. ""One more step and we are on the rock floor,"" said Bod. ""It's a bit uneven.""The room was small. There was a slab of stone on the ground, and a low ledge in one corner, with some small objects on it. There were bones on the ground, very old bones indeed, although below where the steps entered the room Bod could see a crumpled corpse, dressed in the remains of a long brown coat-the young man who had dreamed of riches, Bod decided. He must have slipped and fallen in the dark.The noise began all about them, a rustling slither, like a snake twining through dry leaves. Scarlett's grip on Bod's hand was harder.""What's that? Do you see anything?""""No.""Scarlett made a noise that was half gasp and half wail, and Bod saw something, and he knew without asking that she could see it too.There was a light at the end of the room, and in the light a man came walking, walking through the rock, and Bod heard Scarlett choking back a scream.The man looked well-preserved, but still like something that had been dead for a long while. His skin was painted (Bod thought) or tattooed (Scarlett thought) with purple designs and patterns. Around his neck hung a necklace of sharp, long teeth.""I am the master of this place!"" said the figure, in words so ancient and gutteral that they were scarcely words at all. ""I guard this place from all who would harm it!""His eyes were huge in his head. Bod realized it was because he had circles drawn around them in purple, making his face look like an owl's.""Who are you?"" asked Bod. He squeezed Scarlett's hand as he said it.The Indigo Man did not seem to have heard the question. He looked at them fiercely.""Leave this place!"" he said in words that Bod heard in his head, words that were also a gutteral growl.""Is he going to hurt us?"" asked Scarlett.""I don't think so,"" said Bod. Then, to the Indigo Man, he said, as he had been taught, ""I have the Freedom of the Graveyard and I may walk where I choose.""There was no reaction to this by the Indigo Man, which puzzled Bod even more because even the most irritable inhabitants of the graveyard had been calmed by this statement. Bod said, ""Scarlett, can you see him?""""Of course I can see him. He's a big scary tattooey man and he wants to kill us. Bod, make him go away!""Bod looked at the remains of the gentleman in the brown coat. There was a lamp beside him, broken on the rocky floor. ""He ran away,"" said Bod aloud. ""He ran because he was scared. And he slipped or he tripped on the stairs and he fell off.""""Who did?""""The man on the floor.""Scarlett sounded irritated now, as well as puzzled and scared. ""What man on the floor? It's too dark. The only man I can see is the tattooey man.""And then, as if to make quite sure that they knew that he was there, the Indigo Man threw back his head and let out a series of yodeling screams, a full-throated ululation that made Scarlett grip Bod's hand so tightly that her fingernails pressed into his flesh.Bod was no longer scared, though.""I'm sorry I said they were imaginary,"" said Scarlett. ""I believe now. They're real.""The Indigo Man raised something over his head. It looked like a sharp stone blade. ""All who invade this place will die!"" he shouted, in his gutteral speech. Bod thought about the man whose hair had turned white after he had discovered the chamber, how he would never return to the graveyard or speak of what he had seen.""No,"" said Bod. ""I think you're right. I think this one is.""""Is what?""""Imaginary.""""Don't be stupid,"" said Scarlett. ""I can see it.""""Yes,"" said Bod. ""And you can't see dead people."" He looked around the chamber. ""You can stop now,"" he said. ""We know it's not real.""""I will feast on your liver!"" screamed the Indigo Man.""No, you won't,"" said Scarlett, with a huge sigh. ""Bod's right."" Then she said, ""I think maybe it's a scarecrow.""""What's a scarecrow?"" asked Bod.""It's a thing farmers put in fields to scare crows.""""Why would they do that?"" Bod quite liked crows. He thought they were funny, and he liked the way they helped to keep the graveyard tidy.""I don't know exactly. I'll ask Mummy. But I saw one from a train and I asked what it was. Crows think it's a real person. It's just a made-up thing, that looks like a person, but it's not. It's just to scare the crows away.""Bod looked around the chamber. He said, ""Whoever you are, it isn't working. It doesn't scare us. We know it isn't real. Just stop.""The Indigo Man stopped. It walked over to the rock slab and it lay down on it. Then it was gone.For Scarlett the chamber was once more swallowed by the darkness. But in the darkness, she could hear the twining sound again, getting louder and louder, as if something were circling the round room.Something said, WE ARE THE SLEER.The hairs on the back of Bod's neck began to prickle. The voice in his head was something very old and very dry, like the scraping of a dead twig against the window of the chapel, and it seemed to Bod that there was more than one voice there, that they were talking in unison.""Did you hear that?"" he asked Scarlett.""I didn't hear anything, just a slithery noise. It made me feel strange. All prickly in my tummy. Like something horrible is going to happen.""""Nothing horrible is going to happen,"" said Bod. Then, to the chamber, he said, ""What are you?""WE ARE THE SLEER. WE GUARD AND WE PROTECT.""What do you protect?""THE RESTING PLACE OF THE MASTER. THIS IS THE HOLIEST OF ALL HOLY PLACES, AND IT IS GUARDED BY THE SLEER. ""You can't touch us,"" said Bod. ""All you can do is scare.""The twining voices sounded petulant. FEAR IS A WEAPON OF THE SLEER.Bod looked down at the ledge. ""Are those the treasures of your master? An old brooch, a cup, and a little stone knife? They don't look like much.""THE SLEER GUARDS THE TREASURES. THE BROOCH, THE GOBLET, THE KNIFE. WE GUARD THEM FOR THE MASTER, WHEN HE RETURNS. IT COMES BACK. IT ALWAYS COMES BACK. ""How many of you are there?""But the Sleer said nothing. The inside of Bod's head felt as if it were filled with cobwebs, and he shook it, trying to clear it. Then he squeezed Scarlett's hand. ""We should go,"" he said.He led her past the dead man in the brown coat-and honestly, thought Bod, if he hadn't got scared and fallen the man would have been disappointed in his hunt for treasure. The treasures of ten thousand years ago were not the treasures of today. Bod led Scarlett carefully up the steps, through the hill, into the jutting black masonry of the Frobisher mausoleum.Late spring sunlight shone through the breaks in the masonry and through the barred door, shocking in its brightness, and Scarlett blinked and covered her eyes at the suddenness of the glare. Birds sang in the bushes, a bumblebee droned past, everything was surprising in its normality.Bod pushed open the mausoleum door, and then locked it again behind them.Scarlett's bright clothes were covered in grime and cobwebs, and her dark face and hands were pale with dust.Further down the hill somebody-quite a few some-bodies-was shouting. Shouting loudly. Shouting frantically.Someone called, ""Scarlett? Scarlett Perkins?"" and Scarlett said ""Yes? Hello?"" and before she and Bod had a chance to discuss what they had seen, or to talk about the Indigo Man, there was a woman in a fluorescent yellow jacket with POLICE on the back demanding to know if she was okay, and where she had been, and if someone had tried to kidnap her, and then the woman was talking on a radio, letting them know that the child had been found.Bod slipped along beside them as they walked down the hill. The door to the chapel was open, and inside both of Scarlett's parents were waiting, her mother in tears, her father worriedly talking to people on a mobile phone, along with another policewoman. No one saw Bod as he waited in the corner.The people kept asking Scarlett what had happened to her, and she answered, as honestly as she could, told them about a boy called Nobody who took her deep inside a hill where a purple tattoo man appeared in the dark, but he was really a scarecrow. They gave her a chocolate bar and they wiped her face and asked if the tattooed man had ridden a motorbike, and Scarlett's mother and father, now that they were relieved and not afraid for her any longer were angry with themselves and with her, and they told each other that it was the other one's fault for letting their little girl play in a cemetery, even if it was a nature reserve, and that the world was a very dangerous place these days, and if you didn't keep your eyes on your children every second you could not imagine what awful things they would be plunged into. Especially a child like Scarlett.Scarlett's mother began sobbing, which made Scarlett cry, and one of the policewomen got into an argument with Scarlett's father, who tried to tell her that he, as a taxpayer, paid her wages, and she told him that she was a taxpayer too and probably paid his wages, while Bod sat in the shadows in the corner of the chapel, unseen by anyone, not even Scarlett, and watched and listened until he could take no more.It was twilight in the graveyard by now, and Silas came and found Bod, up near the amphitheater, looking out over the town. He stood beside the boy and he said nothing, which was his way.""It wasn't her fault,"" said Bod. ""It was mine. And now she's in trouble.""""Where did you take her?"" asked Silas.""Into the middle of the hill, to see the oldest grave. Only there isn't anybody in there. Just a snaky thing called a Sleer who scares people.""""Fascinating.""They walked back down the hill together, watched as the old chapel was locked up once more and the police and Scarlett and her parents went off into the night.""Miss Borrows will teach you joined-up letters,"" said Silas. ""Have you read The Cat in the Hat yet?""""Yes,"" said Bod. ""Ages ago. Can you bring me more books?""""I expect so,"" said Silas.""Do you think I'll ever see her again?""""The girl? I very much doubt it.""But Silas was wrong. Three weeks later, on a grey afternoon, Scarlett came to the graveyard, accompanied by both her parents.They insisted that she remain in sight at all times, although they trailed a little behind her. Scarlett's mother occasionally exclaimed about how morbid this all was and how fine and good it was that they would soon be leaving it behind forever.When Scarlett's parents began to talk to each other, Bod said, ""Hello.""""Hi,"" said Scarlett, very quietly.""I didn't think I'd see you again.""""I told them I wouldn't go with them unless they brought me back here one last time.""""Go where?""""Scotland. There's a university there. For Dad to teach particle physics.""They walked on the path together, a small girl in a bright orange anorak and a small boy in a grey winding sheet.""Is Scotland a long way away?""""Yes,"" she said.""Oh.""""I hoped you'd be here. To say good-bye.""""I'm always here.""""But you aren't dead, are you, Nobody Owens?""""'Course not.""""Well, you can't stay here all your life. Can you? One day you'll grow up and then you will have to go and live in the world outside.""He shook his head. ""It's not safe for me out there.""""Who says?""""Silas. My family. Everybody.""She was silent.Her father called, ""Scarlett! Come on, love. Time to go. You've had your last trip to the graveyard. Now let's go home.""Scarlett said to Bod, ""You're brave. You are the bravest person I know, and you are my friend. I don't care if you are imaginary."" Then she fled down the path back the way they had come, to her parents and the world.
TGB_ch3	TGB	The graveyard book	3	8324	46701	CHAPTER THREE - The Hounds of GodONE GRAVE IN EVERY graveyard belongs to the ghouls. Wander any graveyard long enough and you will find it-waterstained and bulging, with cracked or broken stone, scraggly grass or rank weeds about it, and a feeling, when you reach it, of abandonment. It may be colder than the other gravestones, too, and the name on the stone is all too often impossible to read. If there is a statue on the grave it will be headless or so scabbed with fungus and lichens as to look like a fungus itself. If one grave in a graveyard looks like a target for petty vandals, that is the ghoul-gate. If the grave makes you want to be somewhere else, that is the ghoul-gate.There was one in Bod's graveyard.There is one in every graveyard.Silas was leaving.Bod had been upset by this when he had first learned about it. He was no longer upset. He was furious.""But why?"" said Bod.""I told you. I need to obtain some information. In order to do that, I have to travel. To travel, I must leave here. We have already been over all this.""""What's so important that you have to go away?"" Bod's six-year-old mind tried to imagine something that could make Silas want to leave him, and failed. ""It's not fair.""His guardian was unperturbed. ""It is neither fair nor unfair, Nobody Owens. It simply is.""Bod was not impressed. ""You're meant to look after me. You said.""""As your guardian I have responsibility for you, yes. Fortunately, I am not the only individual in the world willing to take on this responsibility.""""Where are you going anyway?""""Out. Away. There are things I need to uncover that I cannot uncover here.""Bod snorted and walked off, kicking at imaginary stones. On the northwestern side of the graveyard things had become very overgrown and tangled, far beyond the ability of the groundskeeper or the Friends of the Graveyard to tame, and he ambled over there, and woke a family of Victorian children who had all died before their tenth birthdays, and they played at hide-and-go-seek in the moonlight in the ivy-twined jungle. Bod tried to pretend that Silas was not leaving, that nothing was going to change, but when the game was done and he ran back to the old chapel, he saw two things that changed his mind.The first thing he saw was a bag. It was, Bod knew the moment he laid eyes on it, Silas's bag. It was at least a hundred and fifty years old, a thing of beauty, black leather with brass fittings and a black handle, the kind of bag a Victorian doctor or undertaker might have carried, containing every implement that might have been needed. Bod had never seen Silas's bag before, he had not even known that Silas had a bag, but it was the sort of bag that could only have belonged to Silas. Bod tried to peek inside it, but it was closed with a large brass padlock. It was too heavy for him to lift.That was the first thing.The second thing was sitting on the bench by the chapel.""Bod,"" said Silas. ""This is Miss Lupescu.""Miss Lupescu was not pretty. Her face was pinched and her expression was disapproving. Her hair was grey, although her face seemed too young for grey hair. Her front teeth were slightly crooked. She wore a bulky mackintosh and a man's tie around her neck.""How do you do, Miss Lupescu?"" said Bod.Miss Lupescu said nothing. She sniffed. Then she looked at Silas and said, ""So. This is the boy."" She got up from her seat and walked all around Bod, nostrils flared, as if she were sniffing him. When she had made a complete circuit, she said, ""You will report to me on waking, and before you go to sleep. I have rented a room in a house over there."" She pointed to a roof just visible from where they stood. ""However, I shall spend my time in this graveyard. I am here as a historian, researching the history of old graves. You understand, boy? Da?""""Bod,"" said Bod. ""It's Bod. Not boy.""""Short for Nobody,"" she said. ""A foolish name. Also, Bod is a pet name. A nickname. I do not approve. I will call you 'boy.' You will call me 'Miss Lupescu.'""Bod looked up at Silas, pleadingly, but there was no sympathy on Silas's face. He picked up his bag and said, ""You will be in good hands with Miss Lupescu, Bod. I am sure that the two of you will get on.""""We won't!"" said Bod. ""She's horrible!""""That,"" said Silas, ""was a very rude thing to say. I think you should apologize, don't you?""Bod didn't, but Silas was looking at him and Silas was carrying his black bag, and about to leave for no one knew how long, so he said, ""I'm sorry, Miss Lupescu.""At first she said nothing in reply. She merely sniffed. Then she said, ""I have come a long way to look after you, boy. I hope you are worth it.""Bod could not imagine hugging Silas, so he held out his hand and Silas bent over and gently shook it, engulfing Bod's small, grubby hand with his huge, pale one. Then, lifting his black leather bag as if it were weightless, he walked down the path and out of the graveyard.Bod told his parents about it.""Silas has gone,"" he said.""He'll be back,"" said Mr. Owens, cheerfully. ""Don't you worry your head about that, Bod. Like a bad penny, as they say.""Mrs. Owens said, ""Back when you were born he promised us that if he had to leave, he would find someone else to bring you food and keep an eye on you, and he has. He's so reliable.""Silas had brought Bod food, true, and left it in the crypt each night for him to eat, but this was, as far as Bod was concerned, the least of the things that Silas did for him. He gave advice, cool, sensible, and unfailingly correct; he knew more than the graveyard folk did, for his nightly excursions into the world outside meant that he was able to describe a world that was current, not hundreds of years out of date; he was unflappable and dependable, had been there every night of Bod's life, so the idea of the little chapel without its only inhabitant was one that Bod found difficult to conceive of; most of all, he made Bod feel safe.Miss Lupescu also saw her job as more than bringing Bod food. She did that too, though.""What is that?"" asked Bod, horrified.""Good food,"" said Miss Lupescu. They were in the crypt. She had put two plastic containers on the tabletop, and opened the lids. She pointed to the first: ""Is beetroot-barley-stew-soup."" She pointed to the second. ""Is salad. Now, you eat both. I make them for you.""Bod stared up at her to see if this was a joke. Food from Silas mostly came in packets, purchased from the kind of places that sold food late at night and asked no questions. No one had ever brought him food in a plastic container with a lid before. ""It smells horrible,"" he said.""If you do not eat the stew-soup soon,"" she said, ""it will be more horrible. It will be cold. Now eat.""Bod was hungry. He took a plastic spoon, dipped it into the purple-red stew, and he ate. The food was slimy and unfamiliar, but he kept it down.""Now the salad!"" said Miss Lupescu, and she unpopped the top of the second container. It consisted of large lumps of raw onion, beetroot, and tomato, all in a thick vinegary dressing. Bod put a lump of beetroot into his mouth and started to chew. He could feel the saliva gathering, and realized that if he swallowed it, he would throw it back up. He said, ""I can't eat this.""""Is good for you.""""I'll be sick.""They stared at each other, the small boy with tousled, mousy hair, the pinched pale woman with not a silver hair out of place. Miss Lupescu said, ""You eat one more piece.""""I can't.""""You eat one more piece now, or you stay here until you have eaten it all.""Bod picked out a piece of vinegary tomato, chewed it, and choked it down. Miss Lupescu put the tops back on the containers and replaced them in the plastic shopping bag. She said, ""Now, lessons.""It was high summer. It would not get fully dark until almost midnight. There were no lessons in high summer-the time that Bod spent awake he spent in an endless warm twilight in which he would play or explore or climb.""Lessons?"" he said.""Your guardian felt it would be good for me to teach you things.""""I have teachers. Letitia Borrows teaches me writing and words, and Mr. Pennyworth teaches me his Compleat Educational System for Younger Gentlemen with Additional Material for Those Post Mortem. I do geography and everything. I don't need more lessons.""""You know everything, then, boy? Six years old, and already you know everything.""""I didn't say that.""Miss Lupescu folded her arms. ""Tell me about ghouls,"" she said.Bod tried to remember what Silas had told him about ghouls over the years. ""Keep away from them,"" he said.""And that is all you know? Da? Why do you keep away from them? Where do they come from? Where do they go? Why do you not stand near a ghoul-gate? Eh, boy?""Bod shrugged and shook his head.""Name the different kinds of people,"" said Miss Lupescu. ""Now.""Bod thought for a moment. ""The living,"" he said. ""Er. The dead."" He stopped. Then, ""...Cats?"" he offered, uncertainly.""You are ignorant, boy,"" said Miss Lupescu. ""This is bad. And you are content to be ignorant, which is worse. Repeat after me, there are the living and the dead, there are day-folk and night-folk, there are ghouls and mist-walkers, there are the high hunters and the Hounds of God. Also, there are solitary types.""""What are you?"" asked Bod.""I,"" she said sternly, ""am Miss Lupescu.""""And what's Silas?""She hesitated. Then she said, ""He is a solitary type.""Bod endured the lesson. When Silas taught him things it was interesting. Much of the time Bod didn't realize he had been taught anything at all. Miss Lupescu taught in lists, and Bod could not see the point to it. He sat in the crypt, aching to be out in the summer's twilight, under the ghost moon.When the lesson was done, in the foulest of moods, he fled. He looked for playmates, but found no one and saw nothing but a large grey dog, which prowled the gravestones, always keeping its distance from him, slipping between gravestones and through shadows.The week got worse.Miss Lupescu continued to bring Bod things she had cooked for him: dumplings swimming in lard; thick reddish-purple soup with a lump of sour cream in it; small, cold boiled potatoes; cold garlic-heavy sausages; hardboiled eggs in a grey unappetizing liquid. He ate as little as he could get away with. The lessons continued: for two days she taught him nothing but ways to call for help in every language in the world, and she would rap his knuckles with her pen if he slipped up, or forgot. By the third day she was firing them at him,""French?""""Au secours.""""Morse Code?""""S-O-S. Three short dots, three long ones, three short ones again.""""Night-Gaunt?""""This is stupid. I don't remember what a night-gaunt is.""""They have hairless wings, and they fly low and fast. They do not visit this world, but they fly the red skies above the road to Ghûlheim.""""I'm never going to need to know this.""Her mouth pinched in tighter. All she said was, ""Night-Gaunt?""Bod made the noise in the back of his throat that she had taught him-a guttural cry, like an eagle's call. She sniffed. ""Adequate,"" she said.Bod could not wait until the day that Silas returned.He said, ""There's a big grey dog in the graveyard sometimes. It came when you did. Is it your dog?""Miss Lupescu straightened her tie. ""No,"" she said.""Are we done?""""For today. You will read the list I give you tonight and remember it for tomorrow.""Miss Lupescu's lists were printed in pale purple ink on white paper, and they smelled odd. Bod took the new list up onto the side of the hill and tried to read the words, but his attention kept sliding off it. Eventually he folded it up and placed it beneath a stone.No one would play with him that night. No one wanted to play or to talk, to run and climb beneath the huge summer moon.He went down to the Owenses' tomb to complain to his parents, but Mrs. Owens would not hear a word said against Miss Lupescu, on, as far as Bod was concerned, the unfair grounds that Silas had chosen her, while Mr. Owens simply shrugged and started telling Bod about his days as a young apprentice cabinetmaker, and how much he would have loved to have learned about all the useful things that Bod was learning, which was, as far as Bod was concerned, even worse.""Aren't you meant to be studying, anyway?"" asked Mrs. Owens, and Bod squeezed his fists together and said nothing.He stomped off into the graveyard, feeling unloved and underappreciated.Bod brooded on the injustice of it all, and wandered through the graveyard kicking at stones. He spotted the dark grey dog, and called to it to see if it would come over and play with him, but it kept its distance, and Bod, frustrated, threw a clump of mud towards it, which broke on a nearby gravestone, and scattered earth everywhere. The big dog gazed at Bod reproachfully, then stepped away into the shadows, and was gone.The boy walked back down the southwest side of the hill, avoiding the old chapel: he did not want to see the place that Silas wasn't. Bod stopped beside a grave that looked the way he felt: it was beneath an oak that had once been struck by lightning, and now was just a black trunk, like a sharp talon coming out of the hill; the grave itself was waterstained and cracked, and above it was a memorial stone on which a headless angel hung, its robes looking like a huge and ugly tree-fungus.Bod sat down on a clump of grass, and felt sorry for himself, and hated everybody. He even hated Silas, for going away and leaving him. Then he closed his eyes, and curled into a ball on the grass, and drifted into a dreamless sleep.Down the street and up the hill came the Duke of Westminster, the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells, slipping and bounding from shadow to shadow, lean and leathery, all sinews and cartilage, wearing raggedy clothes all a-tatter, and they bounded and loped and skulked, leapfrogging over dustbins, keeping to the dark side of hedges.They were small, like full-size people who had shrunk in the sun; they spoke to each other in undertones, saying things like, ""If Your Grace has any more blooming idea of where we is than us do, I'd be grateful if he'd say so. Otherwise, he should keep his big offal-hole shut,"" and ""All I'm saying, Your Worship, is that I knows there's a graveyard near to here, I can smell it,"" and ""If you could smell it then I should be able to smell it, 'cos I've got a better nose than you have, Your Grace.""All this as they dodged and wove their way through suburban gardens. They avoided one garden (""Psst!"" hissed the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh. ""Dogs!"") and ran along the top of the garden wall, scampering over it like rats the size of children. Down into the high street, and up the road to the top of the hill. And then they were at the graveyard wall, and they went up it like squirrels up a tree, and they sniffed the air.""'Ware dog,"" said the Duke of Westminster.""Where? I dunno. Somewhere around here. Doesn't smell like a proper dog anyway,"" said the Bishop of Bath and Wells.""Somebody couldn't smell this graveyard neither,"" said the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh. ""Remember? It's just a dog.""The three of them leapt down from the wall to the ground, and they ran, using their arms as much as their legs to propel themselves through the graveyard, to the ghoul-gate by the lightning tree.And beside the gate, in the moonlight, they paused.""What's this when it's at home, then?"" asked the Bishop of Bath and Wells.""Lumme,"" said the Duke of Westminster.Bod woke then.The three faces staring into his could have been those of mummified humans, fleshless and dried, but their features were mobile and interested-mouths that grinned to reveal sharp, stained teeth; bright beady eyes; clawed fingers that moved and tapped.""Who are you?"" Bod asked.""We,"" said one of the creatures-they were, Bod realized, only a little bigger than he was-""is most important folk, we is. This here is the Duke of Westminster.""The biggest of the creatures gave a bow, saying, ""Charmed, I'm sure.""""...and this is the Bishop of Bath and Wells-""The creature, which grinned sharp teeth and let a pointed tongue of improbable length waggle between them, did not look like Bod's idea of a bishop: its skin was piebald and it had a large spot across one eye, making it look almost piratical. ""...and I 'ave the honor to be ther 'onorable Harchibald Fitzhugh. Hat your service.""The three creatures bowed as one. The Bishop of Bath and Wells said, ""Now me lad, what's your story, eh? And don't tell any porkies, remember as how you're talkin' to a bishop.""""You tell him, Your Worship,"" said the other two.So Bod told them. He told them how no one liked him or wanted to play with him, how no one appreciated him or cared, and how even his guardian had abandoned him.""Blow me down,"" said the Duke of Westminster, scratching his nose (a little dried-up thing that was mostly nostrils). ""What you need is to go somewhere the people would appreciate you.""""There isn't anywhere,"" said Bod. ""And I'm not allowed out of the graveyard.""""You needs an 'ole world of friends and playfellows,"" said the Bishop of Bath and Wells, wiggling his long tongue. ""A city of delights, of fun and magic, where you would be appreciated, not ignored.""Bod said, ""The lady who's looking after me. She makes horrible food. Hard-boiled egg soup and things.""""Food!"" said the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh. ""Where we're going the food's the best in the whole world. Makes me tum rumble and me mouf water just thinking about it.""""Can I come with you?"" asked Bod.""Come with us?"" said the Duke of Westminster. He sounded shocked.""Don't be like that, Yer Grace,"" said the Bishop of Bath and Wells. ""'Ave a blinking 'eart. Look at the little mite. 'Asn't 'ad a decent meal in 'e don't know 'ow long.""""I vote to take him,"" said the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh. ""There's good grub back at our place."" He patted his stomach to show just how good the food was.""So. You game for adventure?"" asked the Duke of Westminster, won over by the novel idea. ""Or do you want to waste the rest of your life here?"" and with bony fingers he indicated the graveyard and the night.Bod thought of Miss Lupescu and her awful food and her lists and her pinched mouth.""I'm game,"" he said.His three new friends might have been his size, but they were far stronger than any child, and Bod found himself picked up by the Bishop of Bath and Wells and held high above the creature's head, while the Duke of Westminster grabbed a handful of mangy-looking grass, shouted what sounded like ""Skagh! Thegh! Khavagah!"" and pulled. The stone slab that covered the grave swung open like a trapdoor, revealing a darkness beneath.""Quick now,"" said the duke, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells tossed Bod into the dark opening, then leapt in after him, followed by the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh and then, with one agile bound, by the Duke of Westminster, who, as soon as he was inside, called out, ""Wegh Khârados!"" to close the ghoul-gate, and the stone crashed down above them.Bod fell, tumbling through the darkness like a lump of marble, too startled to be scared, wondering how deep the hole beneath that grave could possibly be, when two strong hands caught him beneath the armpits and he found himself swinging forward through the pitch-blackness.Bod had not experienced total darkness for many years. In the graveyard, he saw as the dead see, and no tomb or grave or crypt was truly dark to him. Now he was in utter darkness, feeling himself being pitched forward in a sequence of jerks and rushes, the wind rushing past him. It was frightening, but it was also exhilarating.And then there was light, and everything changed.The sky was red, but not the warm red of a sunset. This was an angry, glowering red, the color of an infected wound. The sun was small and seemed like it was old and distant. The air was cold and they were descending a wall. Tombstones and statues jutted out of the side of the wall, as if a huge graveyard had been upended, and, like three wizened chimpanzees in tattered black suits that did up in the back, the Duke of Westminster, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh were swinging from statue to stone, dangling Bod between them as they went, tossing him from one to another, never missing him, always catching him with ease, without even looking.Bod tried to look up, to see the grave through which they had entered this strange world, but he could see nothing but headstones.He wondered if each of the graves they were swinging past was a door for the kind of people who were carrying him....""Where are we going?"" he asked, but his voice was whipped away by the wind.They went faster and faster. Up ahead of them Bod saw a statue swing up, and another two creatures came catapulting out into this crimson-skied world, just like the ones that carried Bod. One wore a raggedy silken gown that looked like it had once been white, the other wore a stained grey suit too large for it, the sleeves of which were shredded into shadowy tatters. They spotted Bod and his three new friends and made for them, dropping twenty feet with ease.The Duke of Westminster gave a guttural squawk and pretended to be scared, and Bod and the three of them swung down the wall of graves with the two new creatures in pursuit. None of them seemed to get tired or out of breath, under that red sky, with the burnt-out sun gazing down at them like a dead eye, but eventually they fetched up on the side of a huge statue of a creature whose whole face seemed to have become a fungoid growth. Bod found himself being introduced to the 33rd President of the United States and the Emperor of China.""This is Master Bod,"" said the Bishop of Bath and Wells. ""He's going to become one of us.""""He's in search of a good meal,"" said the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh.""Well, you're guaranteed fine dining when you becomes one of us, young lad,"" said the Emperor of China.""Yup,"" said the 33rd President of the United States.Bod said, ""I become one of you? You mean, I'll turn into you?""""Smart as a whip, sharp as a tack, you'd have to get up pretty late at night to put anything past this lad,"" said the Bishop of Bath and Wells. ""Indeed. One of us. As strong, as fast, as unconquerable.""""Teeth so strong they can crush any bones, and tongue sharp and long enough to lick the marrow from the deepest marrowbone or flay the flesh from a fat man's face,"" said the Emperor of China.""Able to slip from shadow to shadow, never seen, never suspected. Free as air, fast as thought, cold as frost, hard as nails, dangerous as, as us,"" said the Duke of Westminster.Bod looked at the creatures. ""But what if I don't want to be one of you?"" he said.""Don't want to? Of course you wants to! What could be finer? I don't think there's a soul in the universe doesn't want to be just like us.""""We've got the best city-""""Ghûlheim,"" said the 33rd President of the United States.""The best life, the best food-""""Can you imagine,"" interrupted the Bishop of Bath and Wells, ""how fine a drink the black ichor that collects in a leaden coffin can be? Or how it feels to be more important than kings and queens, than presidents or prime ministers or heroes, to be sure of it, in the same way that people are more important than brussels sprouts?""Bod said, ""What are you people?""""Ghouls,"" said the Bishop of Bath and Wells. ""Bless me, somebody wasn't paying attention, was he? We're ghouls.""""Look!""Below them, a whole troupe of the little creatures were bouncing and running and leaping, heading for the path below them, and before he could say another word, he was snatched up by a pair of bony hands and was flying through the air in a series of jumps and lurches, as the creatures headed down to meet the others of their kind.The wall of graves was ending, and now there was a road, and nothing but a road, a much-trodden path across a barren plain, a desert of rocks and bones, that wound towards a city high on a huge red rock hill, many miles away.Bod looked up at the city, and was horrified: an emotion engulfed him that mingled repulsion and fear, disgust and loathing, all tinged with shock.Ghouls do not build. They are parasites and scavengers, eaters of carrion. The city they call Ghûlheim is something they found, long ago, but did not make. No one knows (if anyone human ever knew) what kind of creatures it was that made those buildings, who honeycombed the rock with tunnels and towers, but it is certain that no one but the ghoul-folk could have wanted to stay there, or even to approach that place.Even from the path below Ghûlheim, even from miles away, Bod could see that all of the angles were wrong-that the walls sloped crazily, that it was every nightmare he had ever endured made into a place, like a huge mouth of jutting teeth. It was a city that had been built just to be abandoned, in which all the fears and madnesses and revulsions of the creatures who built it were made into stone. The ghoul-folk had found it and delighted in it and called it home.Ghouls move fast. They swarmed along the path through the desert more swiftly than a vulture flies and Bod was carried along by them, held high overhead by a pair of strong ghoul arms, tossed from one to another, feeling sick, feeling dread and dismay, feeling stupid.Above them in the sour red skies, things were circling on huge black wings.""Careful,"" said the Duke of Westminster. ""Tuck him away. Don't want the night-gaunts stealing him. Bloody stealers.""""Yar! We hates stealers!"" shouted the Emperor of China.Night-gaunts, in the red skies above Ghûlheim... Bod took a deep breath, and shouted, just as Miss Lupescu had taught him. He made a call like an eagle's cry, in the back of his throat.One of the winged beasts dropped towards them, circled lower, and Bod made the call again, until it was stifled by hard hands clamping over his mouth. ""Good idea, calling 'em down,"" said the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh, ""but trust me, they aren't edible until they've been rotting for at least a couple of weeks, and they just causes trouble. No love lost between our side and theirs, eh?""The night-gaunt rose again in the dry desert air, to rejoin its fellows, and Bod felt all hope vanish.The ghouls sped on towards the city on the rocks, and Bod, now flung unceremoniously over the stinking shoulders of the Duke of Westminster, was carried with them.The dead sun set, and two moons rose, one huge and pitted and white, which seemed, as it rose, to be taking up half the horizon, although it shrank as it ascended, and a smaller moon, the bluish-green color of the veins of mold in a cheese, and the arrival of this moon was an occasion of celebration for the ghoul-folk. They stopped marching and made a camp beside the road.One of the new members of the band-Bod thought it might have been the one he had been introduced to as ""the famous writer Victor Hugo""-produced a sack which turned out to be filled with firewood, several pieces still with the hinges or brass handles attached, along with a metal cigarette lighter, and soon made a fire, around which all the ghoul-folk sat and rested. They stared up at the greenish-blue moon, and scuffled for the best places by the fire, insulting each other, sometimes clawing or biting.""We'll sleep soon, then set off for Ghûlheim at moonset,"" said the Duke of Westminster. ""It's just another nine or ten hours' run along the way. We should reach it by next moonrise. Then we'll have a party, eh? Celebrate you being made into one of us!""""It doesn't hurt,"" said the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh, ""not so as you'd notice. And after, think how happy you'll be.""They all started telling stories, then, of how fine and wonderful a thing it was to be a ghoul, of all the things they had crunched up and swallowed down with their powerful teeth. Impervious they were to disease or illness, said one of them. Why, it didn't matter what their dinner had died of, they could just chomp it down. They told of the places they had been, which mostly seemed to be catacombs and plague-pits. (""Plague-pits is good eatin',"" said the Emperor of China, and everyone agreed.) They told Bod how they had got their names and how he, in his turn, once he had become a nameless ghoul, would be named as they had been.""But I don't want to become one of you,"" said Bod.""One way or another,"" said the Bishop of Bath and Wells, cheerily, ""you'll become one of us. The other way is messier, involves being digested, and you're not really around very long to enjoy it.""""But that's not a good thing to talk about,"" said the Emperor of China. ""Best to be a ghoul. We're afraid of nuffink!""And all the ghouls around the coffin-wood fire howled at this statement, and growled and sang and exclaimed at how wise they were, and how mighty, and how fine it was to be scared of nothing.There was a noise then, from the desert, from far away, a distant howl, and the ghouls gibbered and they huddled closer to the flames.""What was that?"" asked Bod.The ghouls shook their heads. ""Just something out there in the desert,"" whispered one of them. ""Quiet! It'll hear us!""And all the ghouls were quiet for a bit, until they forgot about the thing in the desert, and began to sing ghoul-song, filled with foul words and worse sentiments, the most popular of which were simply lists of which rotting body parts were to be eaten, and in what order.""I want to go home,"" said Bod, when the last of the bits in the song had been consumed. ""I don't want to be here.""""Don't take on so,"" said the Duke of Westminster. ""Why, you little coot, I promise you that as soon as you're one of us, you'll not ever remember as you even had a home.""""I don't remember anything about the days before I was a ghoul,"" said the famous writer Victor Hugo.""Nor I,"" said the Emperor of China, proudly.""Nope,"" said the 33rd President of the United States.""You'll be one of a select band, of the cleverest, strongest, bravest creatures ever,"" bragged the Bishop of Bath and Wells.Bod was unimpressed by the ghouls' bravery or their wisdom. They were strong, though, and inhumanly fast, and he was in the center of a troupe of them. Making a break for it would have been impossible. They would be able to catch up with him before he could cover a dozen yards.Far off in the night something howled once more, and the ghouls moved closer to the fire. Bod could hear them sniffling and cursing. He closed his eyes, miserable and homesick: he did not want to become one of the ghouls. He wondered how he would ever be able to sleep when he was this worried and hopeless and then, almost to his surprise, for two or three hours, he slept.A noise woke him-upset, loud, close. It was someone saying, ""Well, where is they? Eh?"" He opened his eyes to see the Bishop of Bath and Wells shouting at the Emperor of China. It seemed that a couple of the members of their group had disappeared in the night, just vanished, and no one had an explanation. The rest of the ghouls were on edge. They packed up their camp quickly, and the 33rd President of the United States picked Bod up and bundled him over his shoulder.The ghouls scrabbled back down the rocky cliffs to the road, beneath a sky the color of bad blood, and they headed towards Ghûlheim. They seemed significantly less exuberant this morning. Now they seemed-at least to Bod, as he was bounced along-to be running away from something.Around midday, with the dead-eyed sun high overhead, the ghouls stopped, and huddled. Ahead of them, high in the sky, circling on the hot air currents, were the night-gaunts, dozens of them, riding the thermals.The ghouls divided into two factions: there were those who felt that the vanishing of their friends was meaningless, and those who believed that something, probably the night-gaunts, was out to get them. They came to no agreement, except for a general agreement to arm themselves with rocks to throw at the night-gaunts should they descend, and they filled the pockets of their suits and robes with pebbles from the desert floor.Something howled, off in the desert to their left, and the ghouls eyed each other. It was louder than the night before, and closer, a deep, wolfish howl.""Did you hear that?"" asked the Lord Mayor of London.""Nope,"" said the 33rd President of the United States.""Me neither,"" said the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh.The howl came again.""We got to get home,"" said the Duke of Westminster, hefting a large stone.The nightmare city of Ghûlheim sat on a high rocky outcrop ahead of them, and the creatures loped down the road towards it.""Night-gaunts coming!"" shouted the Bishop of Bath and Wells. ""Throw stones at the bleeders!""Bod's view of things was upside down at this point, bouncing up and down on the back of the 33rd President of the United States, gritty sand from the path blown up into his face. But he heard cries, like eagle cries, and once again Bod called for help in Night-Gaunt. No one tried to stop him this time, but he was not sure that anyone could have heard him over the cries of the night-gaunts, or the oaths and curses of the ghoul-folk as they pitched and flung their stones into the air.Bod heard the howling again: now it came from their right.""There's dozens of the blooming blinkers,"" said the Duke of Westminster, gloomily.The 33rd President of the United States handed Bod over to the famous writer Victor Hugo, who threw the boy into his sack and put it over his shoulder. Bod was just glad the sack smelled of nothing worse than dusty wood.""They're retreating!"" shouted a ghoul."" Look at 'em go!""""Don't you worry, boy,"" said a voice that sounded to Bod like the Bishop of Bath and Wells, near the sack. ""There won't be any of this nonsense when we get you to Ghûlheim. It's impenetrable, is Ghûlheim.""Bod could not tell if any of the ghouls had been killed or injured fighting the night-gaunts. He suspected, from the imprecations of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, that several more of the ghouls might have run off.""Quickly!"" shouted someone who was probably the Duke of Westminster, and the ghouls set off at a run. Bod, in the sack, was uncomfortable, being painfully slammed against the famous writer Victor Hugo's back and occasionally banged on the ground. To make his time in the sack even more uncomfortable there were still several lumps of wood, not to mention sharp screws and nails, in there with him, the final remnants of the coffin-based firewood. A screw was just under his hand, digging into him.Despite being jogged and jounced, jolted and jarred with every one of his captor's steps, Bod managed to grasp the screw in his right hand. He felt the tip of it, sharp to the touch. He hoped, deep inside. Then he pushed the screw into the fabric of the sack behind him, working the sharp end in, then pulling it back, and making another hole a little way below the first.From behind, he could hear something howl once more and it occurred to him that anything that could terrify the ghoul-folk must itself be even more terrifying than he could imagine, and for a moment he stopped stabbing with the screw-what if he fell from the sack into the jaws of some evil beast? But at least if he died, thought Bod, he would have died as himself, with all his memories, knowing who his parents were, who Silas was, even who Miss Lupescu was.That was good.He attacked the sacking with his brass screw again, jabbing and pushing until he'd made another hole in the fabric.""Come on, lads,"" shouted the Bishop of Bath and Wells. ""Up the steps and then we're home, all safe in Ghûlheim!""""Hurrah, Your Worship!"" called someone else, probably the Honorable Archibald Fitzhugh.Now the motion of his captors had changed. It was no longer a forward motion: now it was a sequence of movements, up and along, up and along.Bod pushed at the sacking with his hand to try and make an eye-hole. He looked out. Above, the drear red sky, below......he could see the desert floor, but it was now hundreds of feet below him. There were steps stretching out behind them, but steps made for giants, and the ochre rock wall to his right. Ghûlheim, which Bod could not see from where he was, had to be above them. To his left was a sheer drop. He was going to have to fall straight down, he decided, onto the steps, and he would just hope that the ghouls wouldn't notice that he was making his break for it in their desperation to be home and safe. He saw night-gaunts high in the red sky, hanging back, circling.He was pleased to see there were no other ghouls behind him: the famous writer Victor Hugo was bringing up the rear, and no one was behind him to alert the ghouls to the hole that was growing in the sack. Or to see Bod if he fell out.But there was something else....Bod was bounced onto his side, away from the hole. But he had seen something huge and grey, on the steps beneath, pursuing them. He could hear an angry growling noise.Mr. Owens had an expression for two things he found equally unpleasant: ""I'm between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,"" he would say. Bod had wondered what this meant, having seen, in his life in the graveyard, neither the Devil nor the Deep Blue Sea.I'm between the ghouls and the monster, he thought.And as he thought it, sharp canine teeth caught at the sacking, pulled at it until the fabric tore along the rips Bod had made, and the boy tumbled down on the rock stairs, where a huge grey animal, like a dog but far larger, growled and drooled, and stood over him, an animal with flaming eyes and white fangs and huge paws. It panted and it stared at Bod.Ahead of him the ghouls had stopped. ""Bloody Nora!"" said the Duke of Westminster. ""That hellhound's got the blinking boy!""""Let it have him,"" said the Emperor of China. ""Run!""""Yikes!"" said the 33rd President of the United States.The ghouls ran up the steps. Bod was now certain that the steps had been carved by giants, for each step was higher than he was. As they fled, the ghouls paused only to turn and make rude gestures at the beast and possibly also at Bod.The beast stayed where it was.It's going to eat me, Bod thought bitterly. Smart, Bod. And he thought of his home in the graveyard, and now he could no longer remember why he had ever left. Monster dog or no monster dog, he had to get back home once more. There were people waiting for him.He pushed past the beast, jumped down to the next step four feet below, fell his height, landed on his ankle, which twisted underneath him, painfully, and he dropped, heavily, onto the rock.He could hear the beast running, jumping down towards him, and he tried to wriggle away, to pull himself up onto his feet, but his ankle was useless, now, numb and in pain, and before he could stop himself, he fell again. He fell off the step, away from the rock wall, out into space, off the cliff-side, where he dropped-a nightmarish tumble down distances that Bod could not even imagine....And as he fell, he was certain he heard a voice coming from the general direction of the grey beast. And it said, in Miss Lupescu's voice, ""Oh, Bod!""It was like every dream of falling he had ever had, a scared and frantic drop through space, as he headed towards the ground below. Bod felt as though his mind was only big enough for one huge thought, so, That big dog was actually Miss Lupescu, and, I'm going to hit the rock floor and splat, competed in his head for occupation.Something wrapped itself about him, falling at the same speed he was falling, and then there was the loud flapping of leathery wings and everything slowed. The ground no longer seemed to be heading towards him at the same speed.The wings flapped harder. They lifted slightly and now the only thought in Bod's head was I'm flying! And he was. He turned his head. Above him was a dark brown head, perfectly bald, with deep eyes that looked as if they were polished slabs of black glass.Bod made the screeching noise that means ""Help,"" in Night-Gaunt, and the night-gaunt smiled and made a deep hooting noise in return. It seemed pleased.A swoop and a slow, and they touched down on the desert floor with a thump. Bod tried to stand up, and his ankle betrayed him once again, sent him stumbling down into the sand. The wind was high, and the sharp desert sand blew hard, stinging Bod's skin.The night-gaunt crouched beside him, its leathery wings folded on its back. Bod had grown up in a graveyard and was used to images of winged people, but the angels on the headstones looked nothing like this.And now, bounding toward them across the desert floor in the shadow of Ghûlheim, a huge grey beast, like an enormous dog.The dog spoke, in Miss Lupescu's voice.It said, ""This is the third time the night-gaunts have saved your life, Bod. The first was when you called for help, and they heard. They got the message to me, telling me where you were. The second was around the fire last night, when you were asleep: they were circling in the darkness, and heard a couple of the ghouls saying that you were ill-luck for them and that they should beat your brains in with a rock and put you somewhere they could find you again, when you were properly rotted down, and then they would eat you. The night-gaunts dealt with the matter silently. And now this.""""Miss Lupescu?""The great dog-like head lowered towards him, and for one mad, fear-filled moment, he thought she was going to take a bite out of him, but her tongue licked the side of his face, affectionately. ""You hurt your ankle?""""Yes. I can't stand on it.""""Let's get you onto my back,"" said the huge grey beast that was Miss Lupescu.She said something in the night-gaunt's screeching tongue and it came over, held Bod up while he put his arms around Miss Lupescu's neck.""Hold my fur,"" she said. ""Hold tight. Now, before we go, say..."" and she made a high screeching noise.""What does it mean?""""Thank you. Or good-bye. Both.""Bod screeched as best as he could, and the night-gaunt made an amused chuckle. Then it made a similar noise, and it spread its great leathery wings, and it ran into the desert wind, flapping hard, and the wind caught it and carried it aloft, like a kite that had begun to fly.""Now,"" said the beast that was Miss Lupescu, ""hold on tightly."" And she began to run.""Are we going to the wall of graves?""""To the ghoul-gates? No. Those are for ghouls. I am a Hound of God. I travel my own road, into Hell and out of it."" And it seemed to Bod as if she ran even faster then.The huge moon rose and the smaller mold-colored moon and they were joined by a ruby-red moon, and the grey wolf ran at a steady lope beneath them across the desert of bones. She stopped by a broken clay building like an enormous beehive, built beside a small rill of water that came bubbling out of the desert rock, splashed down into a tiny pool and was gone again. The grey wolf put her head down and drank, and Bod scooped water up in his hands, drinking the water in a dozen tiny gulps.""This is the boundary,"" said the grey wolf that was Miss Lupescu, and Bod looked up. The three moons had gone. Now he could see the Milky Way, see it as he had never seen it before, a glimmering shroud across the arch of the sky. The sky was filled with stars.""They're beautiful,"" said Bod.""When we get you home,"" said Miss Lupescu, ""I teach you the names of the stars and their constellations.""""I'd like that,"" admitted Bod.Bod clambered onto her huge, grey back once more and he buried his face in her fur and held on tightly, and it seemed only moments later that he was being carried-awkwardly, as a grown woman carries a six-year-old boy-across the graveyard, to the Owenses' tomb.""He's hurt his ankle,"" Miss Lupescu was saying.""Poor little soul,"" said Mistress Owens, taking the boy from her, and cradling him in her capable, if insubstantial arms. ""I can't say I didn't worry, for I did. But he's back now, and that's all that matters.""And then he was perfectly comfortable, beneath the earth, in a good place, with his head on his own pillow, and a gentle, exhausted darkness took him.Bod's left ankle was swollen and purple. Doctor Trefusis (1870-1936, May He Wake to Glory) inspected it and pronounced it merely sprained. Miss Lupescu returned from a journey to the chemist's with a tight ankle bandage, and Josiah Worthington, Bart., who had been buried with his ebony walking cane, insisted on lending it to Bod, who had too much fun leaning on the stick and pretending to be one hundred years old.Bod limped up the hill and retrieved a folded piece of paper from beneath a stone.The Hounds of Godhe read. It was printed in a purple ink, and was the first item on a list.Those that men call Werewolves or Lycanthropes call themselves the Hounds of God, as they claim their transformation is a gift from their creator, and they repay the gift with their tenacity, for they will pursue an evildoer to the very gates of Hell.Bod nodded.Not just evildoers, he thought.He read the rest of the list, committing it to memory as best he could, then went down to the chapel, where Miss Lupescu was waiting for him with a small meat pie and a huge bag of chips she had bought from the fish-and-chips shop at the bottom of the hill, and another pile of purple-inked duplicated lists.The two of them shared the chips, and once or twice, Miss Lupescu even smiled.Silas came back at the the end of the month. He carried his black bag in his left hand and he held his right arm stiffly. But he was Silas, and Bod was happy to see him, and even happier when Silas gave him a present, a little model of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.It was almost midnight, and it was still not fully dark. The three of them sat at the top of the hill, with the lights of the city glimmering beneath them.""I trust that all went well in my absence,"" said Silas.""I learned a lot,"" said Bod, still holding his Bridge. He pointed up into the night sky. ""That's Orion the Hunter, up there, with his belt of three stars. That's Taurus the Bull.""""Very good,"" said Silas.""And you?"" asked Bod. ""Did you learn anything, while you were away?""""Oh yes,"" said Silas, but he declined to elaborate.""I also,"" said Miss Lupescu, primly. ""I also learned things.""""Good,"" said Silas. An owl hooted in the branches of an oak tree. ""You know, I heard rumors, while I was away,"" said Silas, ""that some weeks ago you both went somewhat further afield than I would have been able to follow. Normally, I would advise caution, but, unlike some, the ghoul-folk have short memories.""Bod said, ""It's okay. Miss Lupescu looked after me. I was never in any danger.""Miss Lupescu looked at Bod, and her eyes shone, then she looked at Silas.""There are so many things to know,"" she said. ""Perhaps I come back next year, in high summer also, to teach the boy again.""Silas looked at Miss Lupescu, and he raised an eyebrow a fraction. Then he looked at Bod.""I'd like that,"" said Bod.
TGB_ch4	TGB	The graveyard book	4	9535	53573	CHAPTER FOUR - The Witch's HeadstoneTHERE WAS A WITCH buried at the edge of the graveyard, it was common knowledge. Bod had been told to keep away from that corner of the world by Mrs. Owens as far back as he could remember.""Why?"" he asked.""T'aint healthy for a living body,"" said Mrs. Owens. ""There's damp down that end of things. It's practically a marsh. You'll catch your death.""Mr. Owens himself was more evasive and less imaginative. ""It's not a good place,"" was all he said.The graveyard proper ended at the bottom of the west side of the hill, beneath the old apple tree, with a fence of rust-brown iron railings, each topped with a small, rusting spearhead, but there was a wasteland beyond that, a mass of nettles and weeds, of brambles and autumnal rubbish, and Bod, who was, on the whole, obedient, did not push between the railings, but he went down there and looked through. He knew he wasn't being told the whole story, and it irritated him.Bod went back up the hill, to the little chapel near the entrance to the graveyard, and he waited until it got dark. As twilight edged from grey to purple there was a noise in the spire, like a fluttering of heavy velvet, and Silas left his resting place in the belfry and clambered headfirst down the spire.""What's in the far corner of the graveyard?"" asked Bod. ""Past Harrison Westwood, Baker of this Parish, and his wives, Marion and Joan?""""Why do you ask?"" said his guardian, brushing the dust from his black suit with ivory fingers.Bod shrugged. ""Just wondered.""""It's unconsecrated ground,"" said Silas. ""Do you know what that means?""""Not really,"" said Bod.Silas walked across the path without disturbing a fallen leaf, and sat down on the bench beside Bod. ""There are those,"" he said, in his silken voice, ""who believe that all land is sacred. That it is sacred before we come to it, and sacred after. But here, in your land, they blessed the churches and the ground they set aside to bury people in, to make it holy. But they left land unconsecrated beside the sacred ground, Potter's Fields to bury the criminals and the suicides or those who were not of the faith.""""So the people buried in the ground on the other side of the fence are bad people?""Silas raised one perfect eyebrow. ""Mm? Oh, not at all. Let's see, it's been a while since I've been down that way. But I don't remember anyone particularly evil. Remember, in days gone by you could be hanged for stealing a shilling. And there are always people who find their lives have become so unsupportable they believe the best thing they could do would be to hasten their transition to another plane of existence.""""They kill themselves, you mean?"" said Bod. He was about eight years old, wide-eyed and inquisitive, and he was not stupid.""Indeed.""""Does it work? Are they happier dead?""""Sometimes. Mostly, no. It's like the people who believe they'll be happy if they go and live somewhere else, but who learn it doesn't work that way. Wherever you go, you take yourself with you. If you see what I mean.""""Sort of,"" said Bod.Silas reached down and ruffled the boy's hair.Bod said, ""What about the witch?""""Yes. Exactly,"" said Silas. ""Suicides, criminals, and witches. Those who died unshriven."" He stood up, a midnight shadow in the twilight. ""All this talking,"" he said, ""and I have not even had my breakfast. While you will be late for lessons."" In the twilight of the graveyard there was a silent implosion, a flutter of velvet darkness, and Silas was gone.The moon had begun to rise by the time Bod reached Mr. Pennyworth's mausoleum, and Thomes Pennyworth (here he lyes in the certainty of the moft glorious refurrection) was already waiting, and was not in the best of moods.""You are late,"" he said.""Sorry, Mr. Pennyworth.""Pennyworth tutted. The previous week Mr. Pennyworth had been teaching Bod about Elements and Humors, and Bod had kept forgetting which was which. He was expecting a test, but instead Mr. Pennyworth said, ""I think it is time to spend a few days on practical matters. Time is passing, after all.""""Is it?"" asked Bod.""I am afraid so, young Master Owens. Now, how is your Fading?""Bod had hoped he would not be asked that question.""It's all right,"" he said. ""I mean. You know.""""No, Master Owens. I do not know. Why do you not demonstrate for me?""Bod's heart sank. He took a deep breath, and did his best, squinching up his eyes and trying to fade away.Mr. Pennyworth was not impressed.""Pah. That's not the kind of thing. Not the kind of thing at all. Slipping and Fading, boy, the way of the dead. Slip through shadows. Fade from awareness. Try again.""Bod tried harder.""You're as plain as the nose on your face,"" said Mr. Pennyworth. ""And your nose is remarkably obvious. As is the rest of your face, young man. As are you. For the sake of all that is holy, empty your mind. Now. You are an empty alleyway. You are a vacant doorway. You are nothing. Eyes will not see you. Minds will not hold you. Where you are is nothing and nobody.""Bod tried again. He closed his eyes and imagined himself fading into the stained stonework of the mausoleum wall, becoming a shadow on the night and nothing more. He sneezed.""Dreadful,"" said Mr. Pennyworth, with a sigh. ""Quite dreadful. I believe I shall have a word with your guardian about this."" He shook his head. ""So. The humors. List them.""""Um. Sanguine. Choleric. Phlegmatic. And the other one. Um, Melancholic, I think.""And so it went, until it was time for Grammar and Composition with Miss Letitia Borrows, Spinster of this Parish (Who Did No Harm to No Man all the Dais of Her Life. Reader, Can You Say Lykewise?). Bod liked Miss Borrows, and the coziness of her little crypt, and that she could all-too-easily be led off the subject.""They say there's a witch in uncons-unconsecrated ground,"" he said.""Yes, dear. But you don't want to go over there.""""Why not?""Miss Borrows smiled the guileless smile of the dead. ""They aren't our sort of people,"" she said.""But it is the graveyard, isn't it? I mean, I'm allowed to go there if I want to?""""That,"" said Miss Borrows, ""would not be advisable.""Bod was obedient, but curious, and so, when lessons were done for the night, he walked past Harrison Westwood, Baker, and family's memorial, a broken-armed angel, but did not climb down the hill to the Potter's Field. Instead he walked up the side of the hill to where a picnic some thirty years before had left its mark in the shape of a large apple tree.There were some lessons that Bod had mastered. He had eaten a bellyful of unripe apples, sour and white-pipped, from the tree some years before, and had regretted it for days, his guts cramping and painful while Mrs. Owens lectured him on what not to eat. Now he always waited until the apples were ripe before eating them, and never ate more than two or three a night. He had finished the last of the apples the week before, but he liked the apple tree as a place to think.He edged up the trunk, to his favorite place in the crook of two branches, and looked down at the Potter's Field below him, a brambly patch of weeds and unmown grass in the moonlight. He wondered whether the witch would be old and iron-toothed and travel in a house on chicken legs, or whether she would be thin and sharp-nosed and carry a broomstick.Bod's stomach growled and he realized that he was getting hungry. He wished he had not devoured all the apples on the tree. That he had left just one...He glanced up, and thought he saw something. He looked once, looked twice to be certain: an apple, red and ripe.Bod prided himself on his tree-climbing skills. He swung himself up, branch by branch, and imagined he was Silas, swarming smoothly up a sheer brick wall. The apple, the red of it almost black in the moonlight, hung just out of reach. Bod moved slowly forward along the branch, until he was just below the apple. Then he stretched up, and the tips of his fingers touched the perfect apple.He was never to taste it.A snap, loud as a hunter's gun, as the branch gave way beneath him.A flash of pain woke him, sharp as ice, the color of slow thunder, down in the weeds that summer's night.The ground beneath him seemed relatively soft, and oddly warm. He pushed a hand down and felt something like warm fur beneath him. He had landed on the grass-pile, where the graveyard's groundskeeper threw the cuttings from the mower, and it had broken his fall. Still, there was a pain in his chest, and his leg hurt as if he had landed on it first and twisted it.Bod moaned.""Hush-a-you-hush-a-boy,"" said a voice from behind him. ""Where did you come from? Dropping like a thunderstone. What way is that to carry on?""""I was in the apple tree,"" said Bod.""Ah. Let me see your leg. Broken like the tree's limb, I'll be bound."" Cool fingers prodded his left leg. ""Not broken. Twisted, yes, sprained perhaps. You have the Devil's own luck, boy, falling into the compost. 'Tain't the end of the world.""""Oh, good,"" said Bod. ""Hurts, though.""He turned his head, looked up and behind him. She was older than him, but not a grown-up, and she looked neither friendly nor unfriendly. Wary, mostly. She had a face that was intelligent and not even a little bit beautiful.""I'm Bod,"" he said.""The live boy?"" she asked.Bod nodded.""I thought you must be,"" she said. ""We've heard of you, even over here, in the Potter's Field. What do they call you?""""Owens,"" he said. ""Nobody Owens. Bod, for short.""""How-de-do, young Master Bod.""Bod looked her up and down. She wore a plain white shift. Her hair was mousy and long, and there was something of the goblin in her face-a sideways hint of a smile that seemed to linger, no matter what the rest of her face was doing.""Were you a suicide?"" he asked. ""Did you steal a shilling?""""Never stole nuffink,"" she said, ""Not even a handkerchief. Anyway,"" she said, pertly, ""the suicides is all over there, on the other side of that hawthorn, and the gallows-birds are in the blackberry-patch, both of them. One was a coiner, t'other a highwayman, or so he says, although if you ask me I doubt he was more than a common footpad and nightwalker.""""Ah,"" said Bod. Then, suspicion forming, tentatively, he said, ""They say a witch is buried here.""She nodded. ""Drownded and burnded and buried here without as much as a stone to mark the spot.""""You were drowned and burned?""She settled down on the hill of grass-cuttings beside him, and held his throbbing leg with her chilly hands. ""They come to my little cottage at dawn, before I'm proper awake, and drags me out onto the Green. 'You're a witch!' they shouts, fat and fresh-scrubbed all pink in the morning, like so many pigwiggins scrubbed clean for market day. One by one they gets up beneath the sky and tells of milk gone sour and horses gone lame, and finally Mistress Jemima gets up, the fattest, pinkest, best-scrubbed of them all, and tells how as Solomon Porritt now cuts her dead and instead hangs around the washhouse like a wasp about a honeypot, and it's all my magic, says she, that made him so and the poor young man must be bespelled. So they strap me to the cucking stool and forces it under the water of the duckpond, saying if I'm a witch I'll neither drown nor care, but if I am not a witch I'll feel it. And Mistress Jemima's father gives them each a silver groat to hold the stool down under the foul green water for a long time, to see if I'd choke on it.""""And did you?""""Oh yes. Got a lungful of water. It done for me.""""Oh,"" said Bod. ""Then you weren't a witch after all.""The girl fixed him with her beady ghost-eyes and smiled a lopsided smile. She still looked like a goblin, but now she looked like a pretty goblin, and Bod didn't think she would have needed magic to attract Solomon Porritt, not with a smile like that. ""What nonsense. Of course I was a witch. They learned that when they untied me from the cucking stool and stretched me on the Green, nine-parts dead and all covered with duckweed and stinking pond-muck. I rolled my eyes back in my head, and I cursed each and every one of them there on the village Green that morning, that none of them would ever rest easily in a grave. I was surprised at how easily it came, the cursing. Like dancing it was, when your feet pick up the steps of a new measure your ears have never heard and your head don't know, and they dance it till dawn."" She stood, and twirled, and kicked, and her bare feet flashed in the moonlight. ""That was how I cursed them, with my last gurgling pond-watery breath. And then I expired. They burned my body on the Green until I was nothing but blackened charcoal, and they popped me in a hole in the Potter's Field without so much as a headstone to mark my name,"" and it was only then that she paused, and seemed, for a moment, wistful.""Are any of them buried in the graveyard, then?"" asked Bod.""Not a one,"" said the girl, with a twinkle. ""The Saturday after they drownded and toasted me, a carpet was delivered to Master Porringer, all the way from London Town, and it was a fine carpet. But it turned out there was more in that carpet than strong wool and good weaving, for it carried the plague in its pattern, and by Monday five of them were coughing blood, and their skins were gone as black as mine when they hauled me from the fire. A week later and it had taken most of the village, and they threw the bodies all promiscuous in a plague pit they dug outside of the town, that they filled in after.""""Was everyone in the village killed?""She shrugged. ""Everyone who watched me get drownded and burned. How's your leg now?""""Better,"" he said. ""Thanks.""Bod stood up, slowly, and limped down from the grass-pile. He leaned against the iron railings. ""So were you always a witch?"" he asked. ""I mean, before you cursed them all?""""As if it would take witchcraft,"" she said with a sniff, ""to get Solomon Porritt mooning round my cottage.""Which, Bod thought, but did not say, was not actually an answer to the question, not at all.""What's your name?"" he asked.""Got no headstone,"" she said, turning down the corners of her mouth. ""Might be anybody. Mightn't I?""""But you must have a name.""""Liza Hempstock, if you please,"" she said tartly. Then she said, ""It's not that much to ask, is it? Something to mark my grave. I'm just down there, see? With nothing but nettles to show where I rest."" And she looked so sad, just for a moment, that Bod wanted to hug her. And then it came to him, as he squeezed between the railings of the fence. He would find Liza Hempstock a headstone, with her name upon it. He would make her smile.He turned to wave good-bye as he began to clamber up the hill, but she was already gone.There were broken lumps of other people's stones and statues in the graveyard, but, Bod knew, that would have been entirely the wrong sort of thing to bring to the grey-eyed witch in the Potter's Field. It was going to take more than that. He decided not to tell anyone what he was planning, on the not entirely unreasonable basis that they would have told him not to do it.Over the next few days his mind filled with plans, each more complicated and extravagant than the last. Mr. Pennyworth despaired.""I do believe,"" he announced, scratching his dusty mustache, ""that you are getting, if anything, worse. You are not Fading. You are obvious, boy. You are difficult to miss. If you came to me in company with a purple lion, a green elephant, and a scarlet unicorn astride which was the King of England in his Royal Robes, I do believe that it is you and you alone that people would stare at, dismissing the others as minor irrelevancies.""Bod simply stared at him, and said nothing. He was wondering whether there were special shops in the places where the living people gathered that sold only headstones, and if so how he could go about finding one, and Fading was the least of his problems.He took advantage of Miss Borrows's willingness to be diverted from the subjects of Grammar and Composition to the subject of anything else at all to ask her about money-how exactly it worked, how one used it to get things one wanted. Bod had a number of coins he had found over the years (he had learned that the best place to find money was to go, afterwards, to wherever courting couples had used the grass of the graveyard as a place to cuddle and snuggle and kiss and roll about. He would often find metal coins on the ground, in the place where they had been) and he thought perhaps he could finally get some use from them.""How much would a headstone be?"" he asked Miss Borrows.""In my time,"" she told him, ""they were fifteen guineas. I do not know what they would be today. More, I imagine. Much, much more.""Bod had two pounds and fifty-three pence. It would, he was quite certain, not be enough.It had been four years, almost half a lifetime, since Bod had visited the Indigo Man's tomb, but he still remembered the way. He climbed to the top of the hill, until he was above the whole town, above even the top of the apple tree, above even the steeple of the little chapel, up where the Frobisher mausoleum stood like a rotten tooth. He slipped down into it, behind the coffin, and down and down and still further down, down to the tiny stone steps cut into the center of the hill, and those he descended until he reached the stone chamber. It was dark in that tomb, dark as a tin mine, but Bod saw as the dead see and the room gave up its secrets to him.The Sleer was coiled around the wall of the barrow. He could feel it. It was as he remembered it, an invisible thing, all smoky tendrils and hate and greed. This time, however, he was not afraid of it.FEAR US, whispered the Sleer. FOR WE GUARD THINGS PRECIOUS AND NEVER-LOST.""I don't fear you,"" said Bod. ""Remember? And I need to take something away from here.""NOTHING EVER LEAVES, came the reply from the coiled thing in the darkness. THE KNIFE, THE BROOCH, THE GOBLET. THE SLEER GUARDS THEM IN THE DARKNESS. WE WAIT.""Pardon me for asking,"" said Bod, ""but was this your grave?""MASTER SETS US HERE ON THE PLAIN TO GUARD, BURIES OUR SKULLS BENEATH THIS STONE, LEAVES US HERE KNOWING WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE GUARD THE TREASURES UNTIL MASTER COMES BACK.""I expect that he's forgotten all about you,"" pointed out Bod. ""I'm sure he's been dead himself for ages.""WE ARE THE SLEER. WE GUARD.Bod wondered just how long ago you had to go back before the deepest tomb inside the hill was on a plain, and he knew it must have been an extremely long time ago. He could feel the Sleer winding its waves of fear around him, like the tendrils of some carnivorous plant. He was beginning to feel cold, and slow, as if he had been bitten in the heart by some arctic viper and it was starting to pump its icy venom through his body.He took a step forward, so he was standing against the stone slab, and he reached down and closed his fingers around the coldness of the brooch.HISH! whispered the Sleer. WE GUARD THAT FOR THE MASTER.""He won't mind,"" said Bod. He took a step backward, walking toward the stone steps, avoiding the desiccated remains of people and animals on the floor.The Sleer writhed angrily, twining around the tiny chamber like ghost-smoke. Then it slowed. IT COMES BACK, said the Sleer, in its tangled triple voice. ALWAYS COMES BACK.Bod went up the stone steps inside the hill as fast as he could. At one point he imagined that there was something coming after him, but when he broke out of the top, into the Frobisher mausoleum, and he could breathe the cool dawn air, nothing moved or followed.Bod sat in the open air on the top of the hill and held the brooch. He thought it was all black, at first, but then the sun rose, and he could see that the stone in the center of the black metal was a swirling red. It was the size of a robin's egg, and Bod stared into the stone wondering if there were things moving in its heart, his eyes and soul deep in the crimson world. If Bod had been smaller he would have wanted to put it into his mouth.The stone was held in place by a black metal clasp, by something that looked like claws, with something else crawling around it. The something else looked almost snake-like, but it had too many heads. Bod wondered if that was what the Sleer looked like, in the daylight.He wandered down the hill, taking all the shortcuts he knew, through the ivy tangle that covered the Bartleby family vault (and inside, the sound of the Bartlebys grumbling and readying for sleep) and on and over and through the railings and into the Potter's Field.He called ""Liza! Liza!"" and looked around.""Good morrow, young lummox,"" said Liza's voice. Bod could not see her, but there was an extra shadow beneath the hawthorn tree, and, as he approached it, the shadow resolved itself into something pearlescent and translucent in the early-morning light. Something girl-like. Something grey-eyed. ""I should be decently sleeping,"" she said. ""What kind of carrying on is this?""""Your headstone,"" he said. ""I wanted to know what you want on it.""""My name,"" she said. ""It must have my name on it, with a big E, for Elizabeth, like the old queen that died when I was born, and a big Haitch, for Hempstock. More than that I care not, for I did never master my letters.""""What about dates?"" asked Bod.""Willyum the Conker ten sixty-six,"" she sang, in the whisper of the dawn-wind in the hawthorn tree. ""A big E if you please. And a big Haitch.""""Did you have a job?"" asked Bod. ""I mean, when you weren't being a witch?""""I done laundry,"" said the dead girl, and then the morning sunlight flooded the wasteland, and Bod was alone.It was nine in the morning, when all the world is sleeping. Bod was determined to stay awake. He was, after all, on a mission. He was eight years old, and the world beyond the graveyard held no terrors for him.Clothes. He would need clothes. His usual dress, of a grey winding sheet, was, he knew, quite wrong. It was good in the graveyard, the same color as stone and as shadows. But if he was going to dare the world beyond the graveyard walls, he would need to blend in there.There were some clothes in the crypt beneath the ruined church, but Bod did not want to go down to the crypt, not even in daylight. While Bod was prepared to justify himself to Master and Mistress Owens, he was not about to explain himself to Silas; the very thought of those dark eyes angry, or worse still, disappointed, filled him with shame.There was a gardener's hut at the far end of the graveyard, a small green building that smelled like motor oil, and in which the old mower sat and rusted, unused, along with an assortment of ancient garden tools. The hut had been abandoned when the last gardener had retired, before Bod was born, and the task of keeping the graveyard had been shared between the council (who sent in a man to cut the grass and clean the paths, once a month from April to September) and the local volunteers in the Friends of the Graveyard.A huge padlock on the door protected the contents of the hut, but Bod had long ago discovered the loose wooden board in the back. Sometimes he would go to the gardener's hut and sit, and think, when he wanted to be by himself.As long as he had been going to the hut there had been a brown workingman's jacket hanging on the back of the door, forgotten or abandoned years before, along with a green-stained pair of gardening jeans. The jeans were much too big for him, but he rolled up the cuffs until his feet showed, then he made a belt out of brown garden-twine, and tied it around his waist. There were boots in one corner, and he tried putting them on, but they were so big and encrusted with mud and concrete that he could barely shuffle in them, and if he took a step, the boots remained on the floor of the shed. He pushed the jacket out through the space in the loose board, squeezed himself out, then put it on. If he rolled up the sleeves, he decided, it worked quite well. It had big pockets, and he thrust his hands into them, and felt quite the dandy.Bod walked down to the main gate of the graveyard, and looked out through the bars. A bus rattled past, in the street; there were cars there and noise and shops. Behind him, a cool green shade, overgrown with trees and ivy: home.His heart pounding, Bod walked out into the world.Abanazer Bolger had seen some odd types in his time; if you owned a shop like Abanazer's, you'd see them too. The shop, in the warren of streets in the Old Town-a little bit antiques shop, a little bit junk shop, a little bit pawnbroker's (and not even Abanazer himself was entirely certain which bit was which) brought odd types and strange people, some of them wanting to buy, some of them needing to sell. Abanazer Bolger traded over the counter, buying and selling, and he did a better trade behind the counter and in the back room, accepting objects that may not have been acquired entirely honestly, and then quietly shifting them on. His business was an iceberg. Only the dusty little shop was visible on the surface. The rest of it was underneath, and that was just how Abanazer Bolger wanted it.Abanazer Bolger had thick spectacles and a permanent expression of mild distaste, as if he had just realized that the milk in his tea had been on the turn, and he could not get the sour taste of it out of his mouth. The expression served him well when people tried to sell him things. ""Honestly,"" he would tell them, sour-faced, ""it's not really worth anything at all. I'll give you what I can, though, as it has sentimental value."" You were lucky to get anything like what you thought you wanted from Abanazer Bolger.A business like Abanazer Bolger's brought in strange people, but the boy who came in that morning was one of the strangest Abanazer could remember in a lifetime of cheating strange people out of their valuables. He looked to be about seven years old, and dressed in his grandfather's clothes. He smelled like a shed. His hair was long and shaggy, and he seemed extremely grave. His hands were deep in the pockets of a dusty brown jacket, but even with the hands out of sight, Abanazer could see that something was clutched extremely tightly-protectively-in the boy's right hand.""Excuse me,"" said the boy.""Aye-aye, Sonny-Jim,"" said Abanazer Bolger warily. Kids, he thought. Either they've nicked something, or they're trying to sell their toys. Either way, he usually said no. Buy stolen property from a kid, and next thing you knew you'd have an enraged adult accusing you of having given little Johnnie or Matilda a tenner for their wedding ring. More trouble than they was worth, kids.""I need something for a friend of mine,"" said the boy. ""And I thought maybe you could buy something I've got.""""I don't buy stuff from kids,"" said Abanazer Bolger flatly.Bod took his hand out of his pocket and put the brooch down on the grimy countertop. Bolger glanced down at it, then he looked at it. He removed his spectacles. He took an eyepiece from the countertop and he screwed it into his eye. He turned on a little light on the counter and examined the brooch through the eyeglass. ""Snakestone?"" he said, to himself, not to the boy. Then he took the eyepiece out, replaced his glasses, and fixed the boy with a sour and suspicious look.""Where did you get this?"" Abanazer Bolger asked.Bod said, ""Do you want to buy it?""""You stole it. You've nicked this from a museum or somewhere, didn't you?""""No,"" said Bod flatly. ""Are you going to buy it, or shall I go and find somebody who will?""Abanazer Bolger's sour mood changed then. Suddenly he was all affability. He smiled broadly. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""It's just you don't see many pieces like this. Not in a shop like this. Not outside of a museum. But I would certainly like it. Tell you what. Why don't we sit down over tea and biscuits-I've got a packet of chocolate chip cookies in the back room-and decide how much something like this is worth? Eh?""Bod was relieved that the man was finally being friendly. ""I need enough to buy a stone,"" he said. ""A headstone for a friend of mine. Well, she's not really my friend. Just someone I know. I think she helped make my leg better, you see.""Abanazer Bolger, paying little attention to the boy's prattle, led him behind the counter, and opened the door to the storeroom, a windowless little space, every inch of which was crammed high with teetering cardboard boxes, each filled with junk. There was a safe in there, in the corner, a big old one. There was a box filled with violins, an accumulation of stuffed dead animals, chairs without seats, books and prints.There was a small desk beside the door, and Abanazer Bolger pulled up the only chair, and sat down, letting Bod stand. Abanazer rummaged in a drawer, in which Bod could see a half-empty bottle of whisky, and pulled out an almost-finished packet of chocolate chip cookies, and he offered one to the boy; he turned on the desk light, looked at the brooch again, the swirls of red and orange in the stone, and he examined the black metal band that encircled it, suppressing a little shiver at the expression on the heads of the snake-things. ""This is old,"" he said. ""It's""-priceless, he thought-""probably not really worth much, but you never know."" Bod's face fell. Abanazer Bolger tried to look reassuring. ""I just need to know that it's not stolen, though, before I can give you a penny. Did you take it from your mum's dresser? Nick it from a museum? You can tell me. I'll not get you into trouble. I just need to know.""Bod shook his head. He munched on his cookie.""Then where did you get it?""Bod said nothing.Abanazer Bolger did not want to put down the brooch, but he pushed it across the desk to the boy. ""If you can't tell me,"" he said, ""you'd better take it back. There has to be trust on both sides, after all. Nice doing business with you. Sorry it couldn't go any further.""Bod looked worried. Then he said, ""I found it in an old grave. But I can't say where."" He stopped, because naked greed and excitement had replaced the friendliness on Abanazer Bolger's face.""And there's more like this there?""Bod said, ""If you don't want to buy it, I'll find someone else. Thank you for the biscuit.""Bolger said, ""You're in a hurry, eh? Mum and dad waiting for you, I expect?""The boy shook his head, then wished he had nodded.""Nobody waiting. Good."" Abanazer Bolger closed his hands around the brooch. ""Now, you tell me exactly where you found this. Eh?""""I don't remember,"" said Bod.""Too late for that,"" said Abanazer Bolger. ""Suppose you have a little think for a bit about where it came from. Then, when you've thought, we'll have a little chat, and you'll tell me.""He got up and walked out of the room, closing the door behind him. He locked it with a large metal key.He opened his hand and looked at the brooch and smiled, hungrily.There was a ding from the bell above the shop door, to let him know someone had entered, and he looked up, guiltily, but there was no one there. The door was slightly ajar though, and Bolger pushed it shut, and then for good measure he turned around the sign in the window, so it said CLOSED. He pushed the bolt shut. Didn't want any busy-bodies turning up today.The autumn day had turned from sunny to grey, and a light patter of rain ran down the grubby shop window.Abanazer Bolger picked up the telephone from the counter and pushed at the buttons with fingers that barely shook.""Paydirt, Tom,"" he said. ""Get over here, soon as you can.""Bod realized that he was trapped when he heard the lock turn in the door. He pulled on the door, but it held fast. He felt stupid for having been lured inside, foolish for not trusting his first impulses, to get as far away from the sour-faced man as possible. He had broken all the rules of the graveyard, and everything had gone wrong. What would Silas say? Or the Owenses? He could feel himself beginning to panic, and he suppressed it, pushing the worry back down inside him. It would all be good. He knew that. Of course, he needed to get out....He examined the room he was trapped in. It was little more than a storeroom with a desk in it. The only entrance was the door.He opened the desk drawer, finding nothing but small pots of paint (used for brightening up antiques) and a paintbrush. He wondered if he would be able to throw paint in the man's face, and blind him for long enough to escape. He opened the top of a pot of paint and dipped in his finger.""What're you doin'?"" asked a voice close to his ear.""Nothing,"" said Bod, screwing the top on the paintpot, and dropping it into one of the jacket's enormous pockets.Liza Hempstock looked at him, unimpressed. ""Why are you in here?"" she asked. ""And who's old bag-of-lard out there?""""It's his shop. I was trying to sell him something.""""Why?""""None of your beeswax.""She sniffed. ""Well,"" she said, ""you should get on back to the graveyard.""""I can't. He's locked me in.""""'Course you can. Just slip through the wall-""He shook his head. ""I can't. I can only do it at home because they gave me the Freedom of the Graveyard when I was a baby."" He looked up at her, under the electric light. It was hard to see her properly, but Bod had spent his life talking to dead people. ""Anyway, what are you doing here? What are you doing out from the graveyard? It's daytime. And you're not like Silas. You're meant to stay in the graveyard.""She said, ""There's rules for those in graveyards, but not for those as was buried in unhallowed ground. Nobody tells me what to do, or where to go."" She glared at the door. ""I don't like that man,"" she said. ""I'm going to see what he's doing.""A flicker, and Bod was alone in the room once more. He heard a rumble of distant thunder.In the cluttered darkness of Bolger's Antiquities, Abanazer Bolger looked up suspiciously, certain that someone was watching him, then realized he was being foolish. ""The boy's locked in the room,"" he told himself. ""The front door's locked."" He was polishing the metal clasp surrounding the snakestone, as gently and as carefully as an archaeologist on a dig, taking off the black and revealing the glittering silver beneath it.He was beginning to regret calling Tom Hustings over, although Hustings was big and good for scaring people. He was also beginning to regret that he was going to have to sell the brooch, when he was done. It was special. The more it glittered, under the tiny light on his counter, the more he wanted it to be his, and only his.There was more where this came from, though. The boy would tell him. The boy would lead him to it.The boy...An idea struck him. He put down the brooch, reluctantly, and opened a drawer behind the counter, taking out a metal biscuit tin filled with envelopes and cards and slips of paper.He reached in, and took out a card, only slightly larger than a business card. It was black-edged. There was no name or address printed on it, though. Only one word, handwritten in the center in an ink that had faded to brown: Jack.On the back of the card, in pencil, Abanazer Bolger had written instructions to himself, in his tiny, precise handwriting, as a reminder, although he would not have been likely to forget the use of the card, how to use it to summon the man Jack. No, not summon. Invite. You did not summon people like him.A knocking on the outer door of the shop.Bolger tossed the card down onto the counter, and walked over to the door, peering out into the wet afternoon.""Hurry up,"" called Tom Hustings, ""it's miserable out here. Dismal. I'm getting soaked.""Bolger unlocked the door and Tom Hustings pushed his way in, his raincoat and hair dripping. ""What's so important that you can't talk about it over the phone, then?""""Our fortune,"" said Abanazer Bolger, with his sour face. ""That's what.""Hustings took off his raincoat and hung it on the back of the shopdoor. ""What is it? Something good fell off the back of a lorry?""""Treasure,"" said Abanazer Bolger. ""Two kinds."" He took his friend over to the counter, showed him the brooch, under the little light.""It's old, isn't it?""""From pagan times,"" said Abanazer. ""Before. From Druid times. Before the Romans came. It's called a snakestone. Seen 'em in museums. I've never seen metalwork like that, or one so fine. Must have belonged to a king. The lad who found it says it come from a grave-think of a barrow filled with stuff like this.""""Might be worth doing it legit,"" said Hustings, thoughtfully. ""Declare it as treasure trove. They have to pay us market value for it, and we could make them name it after us. The Hustings-Bolger Bequest.""""Bolger-Hustings,"" said Abanazer, automatically. Then he said, ""There's a few people I know of, people with real money, would pay more than market value, if they could hold it as you are""-for Tom Hustings was fingering the brooch, gently, like a man stroking a kitten-""and there'd be no questions asked."" He reached out his hand and, reluctantly, Tom Hustings passed him the brooch.""You said two kinds of treasure,"" said Hustings. ""What's t'other?""Abanazer Bolger picked up the black-edged card, held it out for his friend's inspection. ""Do you know what this is?""His friend shook his head.Abanazer put the card down on the counter. ""There's a party is looking for another party.""""So?""""The way I heard it,"" said Abanazer Bolger, ""the other party is a boy.""""There's boys everywhere,"" said Tom Hustings. ""Running all around. Getting into trouble. I can't abide them. So, there's a party looking for a particular boy?""""This lad looks to be the right sort of age. He's dressed-well, you'll see how he's dressed. And he found this. It could be him.""""And if it is him?""Abanazer Bolger picked up the card again, by the edge, and waved it back and forth, slowly, as if running the edge along an imaginary flame. ""Here comes a candle to light you to bed..."" he began.""...and here comes a chopper to chop off your head,"" concluded Tom Hustings, thoughtfully. ""But look you. If we call the man Jack, we lose the boy. And if we lose the boy, we lose the treasure.""And the two men went back and forth on it, weighing the merits and disadvantages of reporting the boy or of collecting the treasure, which had grown in their minds to a huge underground cavern filled with precious things, and as they debated Abanazer pulled a bottle of sloe gin from beneath the counter and poured them both a generous tot, ""to assist the cerebrations.""Liza was soon bored with their discussion, which went back and forth and around like a whirligig, getting nowhere, and so she went back into the storeroom, to find Bod standing in the middle of the room with his eyes tightly closed and his fists clenched and his face all screwed up as if he had a toothache, almost purple from holding his breath.""What you a-doin' of now?"" she asked, unimpressed.He opened his eyes and relaxed. ""Trying to Fade,"" he said.Liza sniffed. ""Try again,"" she said.He did, holding his breath even longer this time.""Stop that,"" she told him. ""Or you'll pop.""Bod took a deep breath and then sighed. ""It doesn't work,"" he said. ""Maybe I could hit him with a rock, and just run for it."" There wasn't a rock, so he picked up a colored glass paperweight, hefted it in his hand, wondering if he could throw it hard enough to stop Abanazer Bolger in his tracks.""There's two of them out there now,"" said Liza. ""And if the one don't get you, t'other one will. They say they want to get you to show them where you got the brooch, and then dig up the grave and take the treasure."" She did not tell him about the other discussions they were having, nor about the black-edged card. She shook her head. ""Why did you do something as stupid as this anyway? You know the rules about leaving the graveyard. Just asking for trouble, it was.""Bod felt very insignificant, and very foolish. ""I wanted to get you a headstone,"" he admitted, in a small voice. ""And I thought it would cost more money. So I was going to sell him the brooch, to buy you one.""She didn't say anything.""Are you angry?""She shook her head. ""It's the first nice thing anyone's done for me in five hundred years,"" she said, with a hint of a goblin smile. ""Why would I be angry?"" Then she said, ""What do you do, when you try to Fade?""""What Mr. Pennyworth told me. 'I am an empty doorway, I am a vacant alley, I am nothing. Eyes will not see me, glances slip over me.' But it never works.""""It's because you're alive,"" said Liza, with a sniff. ""There's stuff as works for us, the dead, who have to fight to be noticed at the best of times, that won't never work for you people.""She hugged herself tightly, moving her body back and forth, as if she was debating something. Then she said, ""It's because of me you got into this.... Come here, Nobody Owens.""He took a step towards her, in that tiny room, and she put her cold hand on his forehead. It felt like a wet silk scarf against his skin.""Now,"" she said. ""Perhaps I can do a good turn for you.""And with that, she began to mutter to herself, mumbling words that Bod could not make out. Then she said, clear and loud,""Be hole, be dust, be dream, be windBe night, be dark, be wish, be mind,Now slip, now slide, now move unseen,Above, beneath, betwixt, between.""Something huge touched him, brushed him from head to feet, and he shivered. His hair prickled, and his skin was all gooseflesh. Something had changed. ""What did you do?"" he asked.""Just gived you a helping hand,"" she said. ""I may be dead, but I'm a dead witch, remember. And we don't forget.""""But-""""Hush up,"" she said. ""They're coming back.""The key rattled in the storeroom lock. ""Now then, chummy,"" said a voice Bod had not heard clearly before, ""I'm sure we're all going to be great friends,"" and with that Tom Hustings pushed open the door. Then he stood in the doorway looking around, looking puzzled. He was a big, big man, with foxy-red hair and a bottle-red nose. ""Here. Abanazer? I thought you said he was in here?""""I did,"" said Bolger, from behind him.""Well, I can't see hide nor hair of him.""Bolger's face appeared behind the ruddy man's and he peered into the room. ""Hiding,"" he said, staring straight at where Bod was standing. ""No use hiding,"" he announced, loudly. ""I can see you there. Come on out.""The two men walked into the little room, and Bod stood stock still between them and thought of Mr. Pennyworth's lessons. He did not react, he did not move. He let the men's glances slide from him without seeing him.""You're going to wish you'd come out when I called,"" said Bolger, and he shut the door. ""Right,"" he said to Tom Hustings. ""You block the door, so he can't get past."" And with that he walked around the room, peering behind things, and bending, awkwardly, to look beneath the desk. He walked straight past Bod and opened the cupboard. ""Now I see you!"" he shouted. ""Come out!""Liza giggled.""What was that?"" asked Tom Hustings, spinning round.""I didn't hear nothing,"" said Abanazer Bolger.Liza giggled again. Then she put her lips together and blew, making a noise that began as a whistling, and then sounded like a distant wind. The electric lights in the little room flickered and buzzed, then they went out.""Bloody fuses,"" said Abanazer Bolger. ""Come on. This is a waste of time.""The key clicked in the lock, and Liza and Bod were left alone in the room.""He's got away,"" said Abanazer Bolger. Bod could hear him now, through the door. ""Room like that. There wasn't anywhere he could have been hiding. We'd've seen him if he was.""""The man Jack won't like that.""""Who's going to tell him?""A pause.""Here. Tom Hustings. Where's the brooch gone?""""Mm? That? Here. I was keeping it safe.""""Keeping it safe? In your pocket? Funny place to be keeping it safe, if you ask me. More like you were planning to make off with it-like you was planing to keep my brooch for your own.""""Your brooch, Abanazer? Your brooch? Our brooch, you mean.""""Ours, indeed. I don't remember you being here, when I got it from that boy.""""That boy that you couldn't even keep safe for the man Jack, you mean? Can you imagine what he'll do, when he finds you had the boy he was looking for, and you let him go?""""Probably not the same boy. Lots of boys in the world, what're the odds it was the one he was looking for? Out the back door as soon as my back was turned, I'll bet."" And then Abanazer Bolger said, in a high, wheedling voice, ""Don't you worry about the man Jack, Tom Hustings. I'm sure that it was a different boy. My old mind playing tricks. And we're almost out of sloe gin-how would you fancy a good Scotch? I've whisky in the back room. You just wait here a moment.""The storeroom door was unlocked, and Abanazer entered, holding a walking stick and a flashlight, looking even more sour of face than before.""If you're still in here,"" he said, in a sour mutter, ""don't even think of making a run for it. I've called the police on you, that's what I've done."" A rummage in a drawer produced the half-filled bottle of whisky, and then a tiny black bottle. Abanazer poured several drops from the little bottle into the larger, then he pocketed the tiny bottle. ""My brooch, and mine alone,"" he muttered, and followed it with a barked, ""Just coming, Tom!""He glared around the dark room, staring past Bod, then he left the storeroom, carrying the whisky in front of him. He locked the door behind him.""Here you go,"" came Abanazer Bolger's voice through the door. ""Give us your glass then, Tom. Nice drop of Scotch, put hairs on your chest. Say when.""Silence. ""Cheap muck. Aren't you drinking?""""That sloe gin's gone to my innards. Give it a minute for my stomach to settle..."" Then, ""Here-Tom! What have you done with my brooch?""""Your brooch is it now? Whoa-what did you...you put something in my drink, you little grub!""""What if I did? I could read on your face what you was planning, Tom Hustings. Thief.""And then there was shouting, and several crashes, and loud bangs, as if heavy items of furniture were being overturned......then silence.Liza said, ""Quickly now. Let's get you out of here.""""But the door's locked."" He looked at her. ""Is there something you can do?""""Me? I don't have any magics will get you out of a locked room, boy.""Bod crouched, and peered out through the keyhole. It was blocked; the key sat in the keyhole. Bod thought, then he smiled, momentarily, and it lit his face like the flash of a lightbulb. He pulled a crumpled sheet of newspaper from a packing case, flattened it out as best he could, then pushed it underneath the door, leaving only a corner on his side of the doorway.""What are you playing at?"" asked Liza, impatiently.""I need something like a pencil. Only thinner..."" he said. ""Here we go."" And he took a thin paintbrush from the top of the desk, and pushed the brushless end into the lock, jiggled it and pushed some more.There was a muffled clunk as the key was pushed out, as it dropped from the lock onto the newspaper. Bod pulled the paper back under the door, now with the key sitting on it.Liza laughed, delighted. ""That's wit, young man,"" she said. ""That's wisdom.""Bod put the key in the lock, turned it, and pushed open the storeroom door.There were two men on the floor, in the middle of the crowded antiques shop. Furniture had indeed fallen; the place was a chaos of wrecked clocks and chairs, and in the midst of it the bulk of Tom Hustings lay, fallen on the smaller figure of Abanazer Bolger. Neither of them was moving.""Are they dead?"" asked Bod.""No such luck,"" said Liza.On the floor beside the men was a brooch of glittering silver; a crimson-orange-banded stone, held in place with claws and with snake-heads, and the expression on the snake-heads was one of triumph and avarice and satisfaction.Bod dropped the brooch into his pocket, where it sat beside the heavy glass paperweight, the paintbrush, and the little pot of paint.""Take this too,"" said Liza.Bod looked at the black-edged card with the word Jack handwritten on one side. It disturbed him. There was something familiar about it, something that stirred old memories, something dangerous. ""I don't want it.""""You can't leave it here with them,"" said Liza. ""They were going to use it to hurt you.""""I don't want it,"" said Bod. ""It's bad. Burn it.""""No!"" Liza gasped. ""Don't do that. You mustn't do that.""""Then I'll give it to Silas,"" said Bod. And he put the little card into an envelope so he had to touch it as little as possible, and put the envelope into the inside pocket of his old gardening jacket, beside his heart.Two hundred miles away, the man Jack woke from his sleep, and sniffed the air. He walked downstairs.""What is it?"" asked his grandmother, stirring the contents of a big iron pot on the stove. ""What's got into you now?""""I don't know,"" he said. ""Something's happening. Something...interesting."" And then he licked his lips. ""Smells tasty,"" he said. ""Very tasty.""Lightning illuminated the cobbled street.Bod hurried through the rain through the Old Town, always heading up the hill toward the graveyard. The grey day had become an early night while he was inside the storeroom, and it came as no surprise to him when a familiar shadow swirled beneath the street lamps. Bod hesitated, and a flutter of night-black velvet resolved itself into a man-shape.Silas stood in front of him, arms folded. He strode forward, impatiently.""Well?"" he said.Bod said, ""I'm sorry, Silas.""""I'm disappointed in you, Bod,"" Silas said, and he shook his head. ""I've been looking for you since I woke. You have the smell of trouble all around you. And you know you're not allowed to go out here, into the living world.""""I know. I'm sorry."" There was rain on the boy's face, running down like tears.""First of all, we need to get you back to safety."" Silas reached down, and enfolded the living child inside his cloak, and Bod felt the ground fall away beneath him.""Silas,"" he said.Silas did not answer.""I was a bit scared,"" he said. ""But I knew you'd come and get me if it got too bad. And Liza was there. She helped a lot.""""Liza?"" Silas's voice was sharp.""The witch. From the Potter's Field.""""And you say she helped you?""""Yes. She especially helped me with my Fading. I think I can do it now.""Silas grunted. ""You can tell me all about it when we're home."" And Bod was quiet until they landed beside the chapel. They went inside, into the empty hall, as the rain redoubled, splashing up from the puddles that covered the ground.Bod produced the envelope containing the black-edged card. ""Um,"" he said. ""I thought you should have this. Well, Liza did, really.""Silas looked at it. Then he opened it, removed the card, stared at it, turned it over, and read Abanazer Bolger's penciled note to himself, in tiny handwriting, explaining the precise manner of use of the card.""Tell me everything,"" he said.Bod told him everything he could remember about the day. And at the end, Silas shook his head, slowly, thoughtfully.""Am I in trouble?"" asked Bod.""Nobody Owens,"" said Silas. ""You are indeed in trouble. However, I believe I shall leave it to your parents to administer whatever discipline and reproach they believe to be needed. In the meantime, I need to dispose of this.""The black-edged card vanished inside the velvet cloak, and then, in the manner of his kind, Silas was gone.Bod pulled the jacket up over his head, and clambered up the slippery paths to the top of the hill, to the Frobisher mausoleum. He pulled aside Ephraim Pettyfer's coffin, and he went down, and down, and still further down.He replaced the brooch beside the goblet and the knife.""Here you go,"" he said. ""All polished up. Looking pretty."" IT COMES BACK, said the Sleer, with satisfaction in its smoke-tendril voice. IT ALWAYS COMES BACK.It had been a long night.Bod was walking, sleepily and a little gingerly, past the small tomb of the wonderfully named Miss Liberty Roach (What she spent is lost, what she gave remains with her always. Reader be Charitable), past the final resting place of Harrison Westwood, Baker of this Parish, and his wives, Marion and Joan, to the Potter's Field. Mr. and Mrs. Owens had died several hundred years before it had been decided that beating children was wrong and Mr. Owens had, regretfully, that night, done what he saw as his duty, and Bod's bottom stung like anything. Still, the look of worry on Mrs. Owens's face had hurt Bod worse than any beating could have done.He reached the iron railings that bounded the Potter's Field, and slipped between them.""Hullo?"" he called. There was no answer. Not even an extra shadow in the hawthorn tree. ""I hope I didn't get you into trouble, too,"" he said.Nothing.He had replaced the jeans in the gardener's hut-he was more comfortable in just his grey winding sheet-but he had kept the jacket. He liked having the pockets.When he had gone to the shed to return the jeans, he had taken a small hand-scythe from the wall where it hung, and with it he attacked the nettle-patch in the Potter's Field, sending the nettles flying, slashing and gutting them till there was nothing but stinging stubble on the ground.From his pocket he took the large glass paperweight, its insides a multitude of bright colors, along with the paint pot, and the paintbrush.He dipped the brush into the paint and carefully painted, in brown paint, on the surface of the paperweight, the letters...E.Hand beneath them he wrote...we don't forgetBedtime, soon, and it would not be wise for him to be late to bed for some time to come.He put the paperweight down on the ground that had once been a nettle-patch, placed it in the place that he estimated her head would have been, and pausing only to look at his handiwork for a moment, he went through the railings and made his way, rather less gingerly, back up the hill.""Not bad,"" said a pert voice from the Potter's Field, behind him. ""Not bad at all.""But when he turned to look, there was no one there.
TGB_ch5	TGB	The graveyard book	5	4607	26048	CHAPTER FIVE - Danse MacabreSOMETHING WAS GOING ON, Bod was certain of it. It was there in the crisp winter air, in the stars, in the wind, in the darkness. It was there in the rhythms of the long nights and the fleeting days.Mistress Owens pushed him out of the Owenses' little tomb. ""Get along with you,"" she said. ""I've got business to attend to.""Bod looked at his mother. ""But it's cold out there,"" he said.""I should hope so,"" she said, ""it being winter. That's as it should be. Now,"" she said, more to herself than to Bod, ""shoes. And look at this dress-it needs hemming. And cobwebs-there are cobwebs all over, for heaven's sakes. You get along,"" this to Bod once more. ""I've plenty to be getting on with, and I don't need you underfoot.""And then she sang to herself, a little couplet Bod had never heard before.""Rich man, poor man, come away.Come to dance the Macabray.""""What's that?"" asked Bod, but it was the wrong thing to have said, for Mistress Owens looked dark as a thunder-cloud, and Bod hurried out of the tomb before she could express her displeasure more forcefully.It was cold in the graveyard, cold and dark, and the stars were already out. Bod passed Mother Slaughter in the ivy-covered Egyptian Walk, squinting at the greenery.""Your eyes are younger than mine, young man,"" she said. ""Can you see blossom?""""Blossom? In winter?""""Don't you look at me with that face on, young man,"" she said. ""Things blossom in their time. They bud and bloom, blossom and fade. Everything in its time."" She huddled deeper into her cloak and bonnet and she said,""Time to work and time to play,Time to dance the Macabray. Eh, boy?""""I don't know,"" said Bod. ""What's the Macabray?""But Mother Slaughter had pushed into the ivy and was gone from sight.""How odd,"" said Bod, aloud. He sought warmth and company in the bustling Bartleby mausoleum, but the Bartleby family-seven generations of them-had no time for him that night. They were cleaning and tidying, all of them, from the oldest (d. 1831) to the youngest (d. 1690).Fortinbras Bartleby, ten years old when he had died (of consumption, he had told Bod, who had mistakenly believed for several years that Fortinbras had been eaten by lions or bears, and was extremely disappointed to learn it was merely a disease), now apologized to Bod.""We cannot stop to play, Master Bod. For soon enough, tomorrow night comes. And how often can a man say that?""""Every night,"" said Bod. ""Tomorrow night always comes.""""Not this one,"" said Fortinbras. ""Not once in a blue moon, or a month of Sundays.""""It's not Guy Fawkes Night,"" said Bod, ""or Hallowe'en. It's not Christmas or New Year's Day.""Fortinbras smiled, a huge smile that filled his pie-shaped, freckly face with joy.""None of them,"" he said. ""This one's special.""""What's it called?"" asked Bod. ""What happens tomorrow?""""It's the best day,"" said Fortinbras, and Bod was certain he would have continued but his grandmother, Louisa Bartleby (who was only twenty) called him over to her, and said something sharply in his ear.""Nothing,"" said Fortinbras. Then to Bod, ""Sorry. I have to work now."" And he took a rag and began to buff the side of his dusty coffin with it. ""La, la, la, oomp,"" he sang. ""La la la, oomp."" And with each ""oomp,"" he would do a wild, whole-body flourish with his rag.""Aren't you going to sing that song?""""What song?""""The one everybody's singing?""""No time for that,"" said Fortinbras. ""It's tomorrow, tomorrow, after all.""""No time,"" said Louisa, who had died in childbirth, giving birth to twins. ""Be about your business.""And in her sweet, clear voice, she sang,""One and all will hear and stayCome and dance the Macabray.""Bod walked down to the crumbling little church. He slipped between the stones, and into the crypt, where he sat and waited for Silas to return. He was cold, true, but the cold did not bother Bod, not really: the graveyard embraced him, and the dead do not mind the cold.His guardian returned in the small hours of the morning; he had a large plastic bag with him.""What's in there?""""Clothes. For you. Try them on."" Silas produced a grey sweater the color of Bod's winding sheet, a pair of jeans, underwear, and shoes-pale green sneakers.""What are they for?""""You mean, apart from wearing? Well, firstly, I think you're old enough-what are you, ten years old now?-and normal, living people clothes are wise. You'll have to wear them one day, so why not pick up the habit right now? And they could also be camouflage.""""What's camouflage?""""When something looks enough like something else that people watching don't know what it is they're looking at.""""Oh. I see. I think."" Bod put the clothes on. The shoelaces gave him a little trouble and Silas had to teach him how to tie them. It seemed remarkably complicated to Bod, and he had to tie and re-tie his laces several times before he had done it to Silas's satisfaction. Only then did Bod dare to ask his question.""Silas. What's a Macabray?""Silas's eyebrows raised and his head tipped to one side. ""Where did you hear about that?""""Everyone in the graveyard is talking about it. I think it's something that happens tomorrow night. What's a Macabray?""""It's a dance, ""said Silas.""All must dance the Macabray,"" said Bod, remembering. ""Have you danced it? What kind of dance is it?""His guardian looked at him with eyes like black pools and said, ""I do not know. I know many things, Bod, for I have been walking this earth at night for a very long time, but I do not know what it is like to dance the Macabray. You must be alive or you must be dead to dance it-and I am neither.""Bod shivered. He wanted to embrace his guardian, to hold him and tell him that he would never desert him, but the action was unthinkable. He could no more hug Silas than he could hold a moonbeam, not because his guardian was insubstantial, but because it would be wrong. There were people you could hug, and then there was Silas.His guardian inspected Bod thoughtfully, a boy in his new clothes. ""You'll do,"" he said. ""Now you look like you've lived outside the graveyard all your life.""Bod smiled proudly. Then the smile stopped and he looked grave once again. He said, ""But you'll always be here, Silas, won't you? And I won't ever have to leave, if I don't want to?""""Everything in its season,"" said Silas, and he said no more that night.Bod woke early the next day, when the sun was a silver coin high in the grey winter sky. It was too easy to sleep through the hours of daylight, to spend all his winter in one long night and never see the sun, and so each night before he slept he would promise himself that he would wake in daylight, and leave the Owenses' cozy tomb.There was a strange scent in the air, sharp and floral. Bod followed it up the hill to the Egyptian Walk, where the winter ivy hung in green tumbles, an evergreen tangle that hid the mock-Egyptian walls and statues and hieroglyphs.The perfume was heaviest there, and for a moment Bod wondered if snow might have fallen, for there were white clusters on the greenery. Bod examined a cluster more closely. It was made of small five-petaled flowers, and he had just put his head in to sniff the perfume when he heard footsteps coming up the path.Bod Faded into the ivy, and watched. Three men and a woman, all alive, came up the path and into the Egyptian Walk. The woman had an ornate chain around her neck.""Is this it?"" she asked.""Yes, Mrs. Caraway,"" said one of the men-chubby and white-haired and short of breath. Like each of the men, he carried a large, empty wicker basket.She seemed both vague and puzzled. ""Well, if you say so,"" she said. ""But I cannot say that I understand it."" She looked up at the flowers. ""What do I do now?""The smallest of the men reached into his wicker basket and brought out a tarnished pair of silver scissors. ""The scissors, Lady Mayoress, ""he said.She took the scissors from him and began to cut the clumps of blossom, and she and the three men started to fill the baskets with the flowers.""This is,"" said Mrs. Caraway, the Lady Mayoress, after a little while, ""perfectly ridiculous.""""It is,"" said the fat man, ""a tradition.""""Perfectly ridiculous,"" said Mrs. Caraway, but she continued to cut the white blossoms and drop them into the wicker baskets. When they had filled the first basket, she asked, ""Isn't that enough?""""We need to fill all four baskets,"" said the smaller man, ""and then distribute a flower to everyone in the Old Town.""""And what kind of tradition is that?"" said Mrs. Caraway. ""I asked the Lord Mayor before me, and he said he'd never heard of it."" Then she said, ""Do you get a feeling someone's watching us?""""What?"" said the third man, who had not spoken until now. He had a beard and a turban and two wicker baskets. ""Ghosts, you mean? I do not believe in ghosts.""""Not ghosts,"" said Mrs. Caraway. ""Just a feeling like someone's looking.""Bod fought the urge to push further back into the ivy.""It's not surprising that the previous Lord Mayor did not know about this tradition,"" said the chubby man, whose basket was almost full. ""It's the first time the winter blossoms have bloomed in eighty years.""The man with the beard and the turban, who did not believe in ghosts, was looking around him nervously.""Everyone in the Old Town gets a flower,"" said the small man. ""Man, woman, and child."" Then he said, slowly, as if he were trying to remember something he had learned a very long time ago, ""One to leave and one to stay and all to dance the Macabray.""Mrs. Caraway sniffed. ""Stuff and nonsense,"" she said, and kept on snipping the blossoms.Dusk fell early in the afternoon, and it was night by half past four. Bod wandered the paths of the graveyard, looking for someone to talk to, but there was no one about. He walked down to the Potter's Field to see if Liza Hempstock was about, but found no one there. He went back to the Owenses' tomb, but found it also deserted: neither his father nor Mistress Owens was anywhere to be seen.Panic started then, a low-level panic. It was the first time in his ten years that Bod could remember feeling abandoned in the place he had always thought of as his home: he ran down the hill to the old chapel, where he waited for Silas.Silas did not come.""Perhaps I missed him,"" thought Bod, but he did not believe this. He walked up the hill to the very top, and looked out. The stars hung in the chilly sky, while the patterned lights of the city spread below him, streetlights and car headlights and things in motion. He walked slowly down from the hill until he reached the graveyard's main gates, and he stopped there.He could hear music.Bod had listened to all kinds of music: the sweet chimes of the ice-cream van, the songs that played on workmen's radios, the tunes that Claretty Jake played the dead on his dusty fiddle, but he had never heard anything like this before: a series of deep swells, like the music at the beginning of something, a prelude perhaps, or an overture.He slipped through the locked gates, walked down the hill, and into the Old Town.He passed the Lady Mayoress, standing on a corner, and as he watched, she reached out and pinned a little white flower to the lapel of a passing businessman.""I don't make personal charitable donations,"" said the man. ""I leave that to the office.""""It's not for charity,"" said Mrs. Caraway. ""It's a local tradition.""""Ah,"" he said, and he pushed his chest out, displaying the little white flower to the world, and walked off, proud as Punch.A young woman pushing a baby buggy was the next to go past.""Wossit for?"" she asked suspiciously, as the Mayoress approached.""One for you, one for the little one,"" said the Mayoress.She pinned the flower to the young woman's winter coat. She stuck the flower for the baby to its coat with tape.""But wossit for?"" asked the young woman.""It's an Old Town thing,"" said the Lady Mayoress, vaguely. ""Some sort of tradition.""Bod walked on. Everywhere he went he saw people wearing the white flowers. On the other street corners, he passed the men who had been with the Lady Mayoress, each man with a basket, handing out the white flowers. Not everyone took a flower, but most people did.The music was still playing: somewhere, at the edge of perception, solemn and strange. Bod cocked his head to one side, trying to locate where it was coming from, without success. It was in the air and all around. It was playing in the flapping of flags and awnings, in the rumble of distant traffic, the click of heels on the dry paving stones...And there was an oddness, thought Bod, as he watched the people heading home. They were walking in time to the music.The man with the beard and the turban was almost out of flowers. Bod walked over to him.""Excuse me,"" said Bod.The man started. ""I did not see you,"" he said, accusingly.""Sorry,"" said Bod. ""Can I have a flower as well?""The man with the turban looked at Bod with suspicion. ""Do you live around here?"" he asked.""Oh yes,"" said Bod.The man passed Bod a white flower. Bod took it, then said, ""Ow,"" as something stabbed into the base of his thumb.""You pin it to your coat,"" said the man. ""Watch out for the pin.""A bead of crimson was coming up on Bod's thumb. He sucked at it while the man pinned the flower to Bod's sweater. ""I've never seen you around here,"" he told Bod.""I live here, all right,"" said Bod. ""What are the flowers for?""""It was a tradition in the Old Town,"" said the man, ""before the city grew up around it. When the winter flowers bloom in the graveyard on the hill they are cut and given out to everybody, man or woman, young or old, rich or poor.""The music was louder now. Bod wondered if he could hear it better because he was wearing the flower--he could make out a beat, like distant drums, and a skirling, hesitant melody that made him want to pick up his heels and march in time to the sound.Bod had never walked anywhere as a sightseer before. He had forgotten the prohibitions on leaving the graveyard, forgotten that tonight in the graveyard on the hill the dead were no longer in their places; all that he thought of was the Old Town, and he trotted through it down to the municipal gardens in front of the Old Town Hall (which was now a museum and tourist information center, the town hall itself having moved into much more imposing, if newer and duller, offices halfway across the city).There were already people around, wandering the municipal gardens-now in midwinter, little more than a large grassy field with, here and there, some steps, a shrub, a statue.Bod listened to the music, entranced. There were people trickling into the square, in ones and twos, in families or alone. He had never seen so many living people at one time. There must have been hundreds of them, all of them breathing, each of them as alive as he was, each with a white flower.Is this what living people do? thought Bod, but he knew that it was not: that this, whatever it was, was special.The young woman he had seen earlier pushing a baby buggy stood beside him, holding her baby, swaying her head to the music.""How long does the music go on for?"" Bod asked her, but she said nothing, just swayed and smiled. Bod did not think she smiled much normally. And only when he was certain that she had not heard him, that he had Faded, or was simply not someone she cared enough about to listen to, she said, ""Blimmen 'eck. It's like Christmases."" She said it like a woman in a dream, as if she was seeing herself from the outside. In the same not-really-there tone of voice, she said, ""Puts me in mind of me Gran's sister, Aunt Clara. The night before Christmas we'd go to her, after me Gran passed away, and she'd play music on her old piano, and she'd sing, sometimes, and we'd eat chocolates and nuts and I can't remember any of the songs she sung. But that music, it's like all of them songs playing at once.""The baby seemed asleep with its head on her shoulder, but even the baby was swaying its hands gently in time to the music.And then the music stopped and there was silence in the square, a muffled silence, like the silence of falling snow, all noise swallowed by the night and the bodies in the square, no one stamping or shuffling, scarcely even breathing.A clock began to strike somewhere close at hand: the chimes of midnight, and they came.They walked down the hill in a slow procession, all stepping gravely, all in time, filling the road, five abreast. Bod knew them or knew most of them. In the first row, he recognized Mother Slaughter and Josiah Worthington, and the old earl who had been wounded in the Crusades and came home to die, and Doctor Trefusis, all of them looking solemn and important.There were gasps from the people in the square. Someone began to cry, saying, ""Lord have mercy, it's a judgment on us, that's what it is!"" Most of the people simply stared, as unsurprised as they would have been if this had happened in a dream.The dead walked on, row on row, until they reached the square.Josiah Worthington walked up the steps until he reached Mrs. Caraway, the Lady Mayoress. He extended his arm and said, loud enough that the whole square could hear him, ""Gracious lady, this I pray: Join me in the Macabray.""Mrs. Caraway hesitated. She glanced up at the man beside her for guidance: he wore a robe and pajamas and slippers, and he had a white flower pinned to the lapel of his robe. He smiled and nodded to Mrs. Caraway. ""Of course,"" Mr. Caraway said.She reached out a hand. As her fingers touched Josiah Worthington's, the music began once more. If the music Bod had heard until then was a prelude, it was a prelude no longer. This was the music they had all come to hear, a melody that plucked at their feet and fingers.They took hands, the living with the dead, and they began to dance. Bod saw Mother Slaughter dancing with the man in the turban, while the businessman was dancing with Louisa Bartleby. Mistress Owens smiled at Bod as she took the hand of the old newspaper seller, and Mr. Owens reached out and took the hand of a small girl, without condescension, and she took his hand as if she had been waiting to dance with him her whole life. Then Bod stopped looking because someone's hand closed around his, and the dance began.Liza Hempstock grinned at him. ""This is fine,"" she said, as they began to tread the steps of the dance together.Then she sang, to the tune of the dance,""Step and turn, and walk and stay,Now we dance the Macabray.""The music filled Bod's head and chest with a fierce joy, and his feet moved as if they knew the steps already, had known them forever.He danced with Liza Hempstock, and then, when that measure ended, he found his hand taken by Fortinbras Bartleby, and he danced with Fortinbras, stepping past lines of dancers, lines that parted as they came through.Bod saw Abanazer Bolger dancing with Miss Borrows, his old former teacher. He saw the living dancing with the dead. And the one-on-one dances became long lines of people stepping together in unison, walking and kicking (La-la-la-oomp! La-la-la-oomp!) a line dance that had been ancient a thousand years before.Now he was in the line beside Liza Hempstock. He said, ""Where does the music come from?""She shrugged.""Who's making all this happen?""""It always happens,"" she told him. ""The living may not remember, but we always do..."" And she broke off, excited. ""Look!""Bod had never seen a real horse before, only in the pages of picture books, but the white horse that clopped down the street towards them was nothing like the horses he had imagined. It was bigger, by far, with a long, serious face. There was a woman riding on the horse's bare back, wearing a long grey dress that hung and gleamed beneath the December moon like cobwebs in the dew.She reached the square, and the horse stopped, and the woman in grey slipped off it easily and stood on the earth, facing them all, the living and the dead of them.She curtseyed.And, as one, they bowed or curtseyed in return, and the dance began anew.""Now the Lady on the GreyLeads us in the Macabray,""sang Liza Hempstock, before the whirl of the dance took her off and away from Bod. They stomped to the music, and stepped and spun and kicked, and the lady danced with them, stepping and spinning and kicking with enthusiasm. Even the white horse swayed its head and stepped and shifted to the music.The dance sped up, and the dancers with it. Bod was breathless, but he could not imagine the dance ever stopping: the Macabray, the dance of the living and the dead, the dance with Death. Bod was smiling, and everyone was smiling.He caught sight of the lady in the grey dress from time to time, as he spun and stomped his way across the municipal gardens.Everyone, thought Bod, everyone is dancing! He thought it, and as soon as he thought it he realized that he was mistaken. In the shadows by the Old Town Hall, a man was standing, dressed all in black. He was not dancing. He was watching them.Bod wondered if it was longing that he saw on Silas's face, or sorrow, or something else, but his guardian's face was unreadable.He called out, ""Silas!"" hoping to make his guardian come to them, to join the dance, to have the fun they were having, but when he heard his name, Silas stepped back into the shadows and was lost to sight.""Last dance!"" someone called, and the music skirled up into something stately and slow and final.Each of the dancers took a partner, the living with the dead, each to each. Bod reached out his hand and found himself touching fingers with, and gazing into the grey eyes of, the lady in the cobweb dress.She smiled at him.""Hello, Bod,"" she said.""Hello,"" he said, as he danced with her. ""I don't know your name.""""Names aren't really important,"" she said.""I love your horse. He's so big! I never knew horses could be that big.""""He is gentle enough to bear the mightiest of you away on his broad back, and strong enough for the smallest of you as well.""""Can I ride him?"" asked Bod.""One day,"" she told him, and her cobweb skirts shimmered. ""One day. Everybody does.""""Promise?""""I promise.""And with that, the dance was done. Bod bowed low to his dancing partner, and then, and only then, did he feel exhausted, feel as if he had been dancing for hour after hour. He could feel all his muscles aching and protesting. He was out of breath.A clock somewhere began to strike the hour, and Bod counted along with it. Twelve chimes. He wondered if they had been dancing for twelve hours or twenty-four or for no time at all.He straightened up, and looked around him. The dead had gone, and the Lady on the Grey. Only the living remained, and they were beginning to make their way home-leaving the town square sleepily, stiffly, like people who had awakened from a deep sleep, walking without truly waking.The town square was covered with tiny white flowers. It looked as if there had been a wedding.Bod woke the next afternoon in the Owenses' tomb feeling like he knew a huge secret, that he had done something important, and was burning to talk about it.When Mistress Owens got up, Bod said, ""That was amazing last night!""Mistress Owens said, ""Oh yes?""""We danced,"" said Bod. ""All of us. Down in the Old Town.""""Did we indeed?"" said Mistress Owens, with a snort. ""Dancing is it? And you know you aren't allowed down into the town.""Bod knew better than even to try to talk to his mother when she was in this kind of mood. He slipped out of the tomb into the gathering dusk.He walked up the hill, to the black obelisk, and Josiah Worthington's stone, where there was a natural amphitheater, and he could look out at the Old Town and at the lights of the city around it.Josiah Worthington was standing beside him.Bod said, ""You began the dance. With the Mayor. You danced with her.""Josiah Worthington looked at him and said nothing.""You did,"" said Bod.Josiah Worthington said, ""The dead and the living do not mingle, boy. We are no longer part of their world; they are no part of ours. If it happened that we danced the danse macabre with them, the dance of death, then we would not speak of it, and we certainly would not to speak of it to the living.""""But I'm one of you.""""Not yet, boy. Not for a lifetime.""And Bod realized why he had danced as one of the living, and not as one of the crew that had walked down the hill, and he said only, ""I see...I think.""He went down the hill at a run, a ten-year-old boy in a hurry, going so fast he almost tripped over Digby Poole (1785-1860, As I Am So Shall You Be), righting himself by effort of will, and charged down to the old chapel, scared he would miss Silas, that his guardian would already be gone by the time Bod got there.Bod sat down on the bench.There was a movement beside him, although he heard nothing move, and his guardian said, ""Good evening, Bod.""""You were there last night,"" said Bod. ""Don't try and say you weren't there or something because I know you were.""""Yes,"" said Silas.""I danced with her. With the lady on the white horse.""""Did you?""""You saw it! You watched us! The living and the dead! We were dancing. Why won't anyone talk about it?""""Because there are mysteries. Because there are things that people are forbidden to speak about. Because there are things they do not remember.""""But you're speaking about it right now. We're talking about the Macabray.""""I have not danced it,"" said Silas.""You saw it, though.""Silas said only, ""I don't know what I saw.""""I danced with the lady, Silas!"" exclaimed Bod. His guardian looked almost heartbroken then, and Bod found himself scared, like a child who has woken a sleeping panther.But all Silas said was, ""This conversation is at an end.""Bod might have said something-there were a hundred things he wanted to say, unwise though it might have been to say them-when something distracted his attention: a rustling noise, soft and gentle, and a cold feather-touch as something brushed his face.All thoughts of dancing were forgotten then, and his fear was replaced with delight and with awe.It was the third time in his life that he had seen it.""Look, Silas, it's snowing!"" he said, joy filling his chest and his head, leaving no room for anything else. ""It's really snow!""
TGB_ch6	TGB	The graveyard book	6	8487	47836	CHAPTER SIX - Nobody Owens' School DaysRAIN IN THE GRAVEYARD, and the world puddled into blurred reflections. Bod sat, concealed from anyone, living or dead, who might come looking for him, under the arch that separated the Egyptian Walk and the northwestern wilderness beyond it from the rest of the graveyard, and he read his book.""Damm'ee!"" came a shout from down the path. ""Damm'ee, sir, and blast your eyes! When I catch you-and find you I shall-I shall make you rue the day you were born!""Bod sighed and he lowered the book, and leaned out enough to see Thackeray Porringer (1720-1734, son of the above) come stamping up the slippery path. Thackeray was a big boy-he had been fourteen when he died, following his initiation as an apprentice to a master house painter: he had been given eight copper pennies and told not to come back without a half-a-gallon of red and white striped paint for painting barber's poles. Thackeray had spent five hours being sent all over the town one slushy January morning, being laughed at in each establishment he visited and then sent on to the next; when he realized he had been made a fool of, he had taken an angry case of apoplexy, which carried him off within the week, and he died glaring furiously at the other apprentices and even at Mr. Horrobin, the master painter, who had undergone so much worse back when he was a 'prentice that he could scarcely see what all the fuss was about.So Thackeray Porringer had died in a fury, clutching his copy of Robinson Crusoe which was, apart from a silver sixpence with the edges clipped and the clothes he had formerly been standing up in, all that he owned, and, at his mother's request, he was buried with his book. Death had not improved Thackeray Porringer's temper, and now he was shouting, ""I know you're here somewhere! Come out and take your punishment, you, you thief!""Bod closed the book. ""I'm not a thief, Thackeray. I'm only borrowing it. I promise I'll give the book back when I've finished it.""Thackeray looked up, saw Bod nestled behind the statue of Osiris. ""I told you not to!""Bod sighed. ""But there are so few books here. It's just up to a good bit anyway. He's found a footprint. It's not his. That means someone else is on the island!""""It's my book,"" said Thackeray Porringer, obstinately. ""Give it back.""Bod was ready to argue or simply to negotiate, but he saw the hurt look on Thackeray's face, and he relented. Bod clambered down the side of the arch, jumped the last few feet. He held out the book. ""Here."" Thackeray took it gracelessly, and glared.""I could read it to you,"" offered Bod. ""I could do that.""""You could go and boil your fat head,"" said Thackeray, and he swung a punch at Bod's ear. It connected, and it stung, although judging from the look on Thackeray Porringer's face, Bod realized it must have hurt his fist as much as it hurt Bod.The bigger boy stomped off down the path, and Bod watched him go, ear hurting, eyes stinging. Then he walked though the rain back down the treacherous ivy-covered path. At one point he slipped and scraped his knee, tearing his jeans.There was a willow-grove beside the wall, and Bod almost ran into Miss Euphemia Horsfall and Tom Sands, who had been stepping out together for many years. Tom had been buried so long ago that his stone was just a weathered rock, and he had lived and died during the Hundred Years War with France, while Miss Euphemia (1861-1883, She Sleeps, Aye, Yet She Sleeps with Angels) had been buried in Victorian times, after the graveyard had been expanded and extended and became, for some fifty years, a successful commercial enterprise, and she had a whole tomb to herself behind a black door in the Willow Walk. But the couple seemed to have no troubles with the difference in their historical periods.""You should slow down, young Bod,"" said Tom. ""You'll do yourself an injury.""""You already did,"" said Miss Euphemia. ""Oh dear, Bod. I have no doubt that your mother will have words with you about that. It's not as if we can easily repair those pantaloons.""""Um. Sorry,"" said Bod.""And your guardian was looking for you,"" added Tom.Bod looked up at the grey sky. ""But it's still daylight,"" he said.""He's up betimes,"" said Tom, a word which, Bod knew, meant early, ""and said to tell you he wanted you. If we saw you.""Bod nodded.""There's ripe hazel-nuts in the thicket just beyond the Littlejohns' monument,"" said Tom with a smile, as if softening a blow.""Thank you,"" said Bod. He ran on, pell-mell, through the rain and down the winding path into the lower slopes of the graveyard, running until he reached the old chapel.The chapel door was open and Silas, who had love for neither the rain nor for the remnants of the daylight, was standing inside, in the shadows.""I heard you were looking for me,"" said Bod.""Yes,"" said Silas. Then, ""It appears you've torn your trousers.""""I was running,"" said Bod. ""Um. I got into a bit of a fight with Thackeray Porringer. I wanted to read Robinson Crusoe. It's a book about a man on a boat-that's a thing that goes in the sea, which is water like an enormous puddle-and how the ship is wrecked on an island, which is a place on the sea where you can stand, and-""Silas said, ""It has been eleven years, Bod. Eleven years that you have been with us.""""Right,"" said Bod. ""If you say so.""Silas looked down at his charge. The boy was lean, and his mouse-colored hair had darkened slightly with age.Inside the old chapel, it was all shadows.""I think,"" said Silas, ""it is time to talk about where you came from.""Bod breathed in deeply. He said, ""It doesn't have to be now. Not if you don't want to."" He said it as easily as he could, but his heart was thudding in his chest.Silence. Only the patter of the rain and the wash of the water from the drainpipes. A silence that stretched until Bod thought that he would break.Silas said, ""You know you're different. That you are alive. That we took you in-they took you in here-and that I agreed to be your guardian.""Bod said nothing.Silas continued, in his voice like velvet, ""You had parents. An older sister. They were killed. I believe that you were to have been killed as well, and that you were not was due to chance, and the intervention of the Owenses.""""And you,"" said Bod, who had had that night described to him over the years by many people, some of whom had even been there. It had been a big night in the graveyard.Silas said, ""Out there, the man who killed your family is, I believe, still looking for you, still intends to kill you.""Bod shrugged. ""So?"" he said. ""It's only death. I mean, all of my best friends are dead.""""Yes."" Silas hesitated. ""They are. And they are, for the most part, done with the world. You are not. You're alive, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything. If you change the world, the world will change. Potential. Once you're dead, it's gone. Over. You've made what you've made, dreamed your dream, written your name. You may be buried here, you may even walk. But that potential is finished.""Bod thought about this. It seemed almost true, although he could think of exceptions-his parents adopting him, for example. But the dead and the living were different, he knew that, even if his sympathies were with the dead.""What about you?"" he asked Silas.""What about me?""""Well, you aren't alive. And you go around and do things.""""I,"" said Silas, ""am precisely what I am, and nothing more. I am, as you say, not alive. But if I am ended, I shall simply cease to be. My kind are, or we are not. If you see what I mean.""""Not really.""Silas sighed. The rain was done and the cloudy gloaming had become true twilight. ""Bod,"" he said, ""there are many reasons why it is important that we keep you safe.""Bod said, ""The person who hurt my family. The one who wants to kill me. You are certain that he's still out there?"" It was something he had been thinking about for a while now, and he knew what he wanted.""Yes. He's still out there.""""Then,"" said Bod, and said the unsayable, ""I want to go to school.""Silas was imperturbable. The world could have ended, and he would not have turned a hair. But now his mouth opened and his brow furrowed, and he said only,""What?""""I've learned a lot in this graveyard,"" said Bod. ""I can Fade and I can Haunt. I can open a ghoul-gate and I know the constellations. But there's a world out there, with the sea in it, and islands, and shipwrecks and pigs. I mean, it's filled with things I don't know. And the teachers here have taught me lots of things, but I need more. If I'm going to survive out there, one day.""Silas seemed unimpressed. ""Out of the question. Here we can keep you safe. How could we keep you safe, out there? Outside, anything could happen.""""Yes,"" agreed Bod. ""That's the potential thing you were talking about."" He fell silent. Then, ""Someone killed my mother and my father and my sister.""""Yes. Someone did.""""A man?""""A man.""""Which means,"" said Bod, ""you're asking the wrong question.""Silas raised an eyebrow. ""How so?""""Well,"" said Bod. ""If I go outside in the world, the question isn't 'who will keep me safe from him?'""""No?""""No. It's 'who will keep him safe from me?'""Twigs scratched against the high windows, as if they needed to be let in. Silas flicked an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve with a fingernail as sharp as a blade. He said, ""We will need to find you a school.""No one noticed the boy, not at first. No one even noticed that they hadn't noticed him. He sat halfway back in class. He didn't answer much, not unless he was directly asked a question, and even then his answers were short and forgettable, colorless: he faded, in mind and in memory.""Do you think they're religious, his family?"" asked Mr. Kirby, in the teachers' staff room. He was marking essays.""Whose family?"" asked Mrs. McKinnon.""Owens in Eight B,"" said Mr. Kirby.""The tall spotty lad?""""I don't think so. Sort of medium height.""Mrs. McKinnon shrugged. ""What about him?""""Handwrites everything,"" said Mr. Kirby. ""Lovely handwriting. What they used to call copperplate.""""And that makes him religious because...?""""He says they don't have a computer.""""And?""""He doesn't have a phone.""""I don't see why that makes him religious,"" said Mrs. McKinnon, who had taken up crocheting when they had banned smoking in the staff room, and was sitting and crocheting a baby blanket for no one in particular.Mr. Kirby shrugged. ""He's a smart lad,"" he said. ""There's just stuff he doesn't know. And in History he'll throw in little made-up details, stuff not in the books...""""What kind of stuff?""Mr. Kirby finished marking Bod's essay and put it down on the pile. Without something immediately in front of him the whole matter seemed vague and unimportant. ""Stuff,"" he said, and forgot about it. Just as he forgot to enter Bod's name on the roll. Just as Bod's name was not to be found on the school databases.The boy was a model pupil, forgettable and easily forgotten, and he spent much of his spare time in the back of the English class where there were shelves of old paperbacks, and in the school library, a large room filled with books and old armchairs, where he read stories as enthusiastically as some children ate.Even the other kids forgot about him. Not when he was sitting in front of them: they remembered him then. But when that Owens kid was out of sight he was out of mind. They didn't think about him. They didn't need to. If someone asked all the kids in Eight B to close their eyes and list the twenty-five boys and girls in the class, that Owens kid wouldn't have been on the list. His presence was almost ghostly.It was different if he was there, of course.Nick Farthing was twelve, but he could pass-and did sometimes-for sixteen: a large boy with a crooked smile, and little imagination. He was practical, in a basic sort of way, an efficient shoplifter, and occasional thug who did not care about being liked as long as the other kids, all smaller, did what he said. Anyway, he had a friend. Her name was Maureen Quilling, but everyone called her Mo, and she was thin and had pale skin and pale yellow hair, watery blue eyes, and a sharp, inquisitive nose. Nick liked to shoplift, but Mo told him what to steal. Nick could hit and hurt and intimidate, but Mo pointed him at the people who needed to be intimidated. They were, as she told him sometimes, a perfect team.They were sitting in the corner of the library splitting their take of the year sevens' pocket money. They had eight or nine of the eleven-year-olds trained to hand over their pocket money every week.""The Singh kid hasn't coughed up yet,"" said Mo. ""You'll have to find him.""""Yeah,"" said Nick, ""he'll pay.""""What was it he nicked? A CD?""Nick nodded.""Just point out the error of his ways,"" said Mo, who wanted to sound like the hard cases from the television.""Easy,"" said Nick. ""We're a good team.""""Like Batman and Robin,"" said Mo.""More like Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde,"" said somebody, who had been reading, unnoticed, in a window seat, and he got up and walked out of the room.Paul Singh was sitting on a windowsill by the changing rooms, his hands deep in his pockets, thinking dark thoughts. He took one hand out of his pocket, opened it, looked at the handful of pound coins, shook his head, closed his hand around the coins once more.""Is that what Nick and Mo are waiting for?"" somebody asked, and Paul jumped, scattering money all over the floor.The other boy helped him pick the coins up, handed them over. He was an older boy, and Paul thought he had seen him around before, but he could not be certain. Paul said, ""Are you with them? Nick and Mo?""The other boy shook his head. ""Nope. I think that they are fairly repulsive."" He hesitated. Then he said, ""Actually, I came to give you a bit of advice.""""Yeah?""""Don't pay them.""""Easy for you to say.""""Because they aren't blackmailing me?""The boy looked at Paul and Paul looked away, ashamed.""They hit you or threatened you until you shoplifted a CD for them. Then they told you that unless you handed over your pocket money to them, they'd tell on you. What did they do, film you doing it?""Paul nodded.""Just say no,"" said the boy. ""Don't do it.""""They'll kill me. And they said...""""Tell them that you think the police and school authorities could be a lot more interested in a couple of kids who are getting younger kids to steal for them and then forcing them to hand over their pocket money than they ever would be in one kid forced to steal a CD against his will. That if they touch you again, you'll make the call to the police. And that you've written it all up, and if anything happens to you, anything at all, if you get a black eye or anything, your friends will automatically send it to the school authorities and the police.""Paul said, ""But. I can't.""""Then you'll pay them your pocket money for the rest of your time in this school. And you'll stay scared of them.""Paul thought. ""Why don't I just tell the police anyway?"" he asked.""Can if you like.""""I'll try it your way first,"" Paul said. He smiled. It wasn't a big smile, but it was a smile, right enough, his first in three weeks.So Paul Singh explained to Nick Farthing just how and why he wouldn't be paying him any longer, and walked away while Nick Farthing just stood and didn't say anything, clenching and unclenching his fists. And the next day another five eleven-year-olds found Nick Farthing in the playground, and told him they wanted their money back, all the pocket money they'd handed over in the previous month, or they'd be going to the police, and now Nick Farthing was an extremely unhappy young man.Mo said, ""It was him. He started it. If it wasn't for him...they'd never have thought of it on their own. He's the one we have to teach a lesson. Then they'll all behave.""""Who?"" said Nick.""The one who's always reading. The one from the library. Bob Owens. Him.""Nick nodded slowly. Then he said, ""Which one is he?""""I'll point him out to you,"" said Mo.Bod was used to being ignored, to existing in the shadows. When glances naturally slip from you, you become very aware of eyes upon you, of glances in your direction, of attention. And if you barely exist in people's minds as another living person then being pointed to, being followed around...these things draw attention to themselves.They followed him out of the school and up the road, past the corner newsagent, and across the railway bridge. He took his time, making certain that the two who were following him, a burly boy and a fair, sharp-faced girl, did not lose him, then he walked into the tiny churchyard at the end of the road, a miniature graveyard behind the local church and he waited beside the tomb of Roderick Persson and his wife Amabella, and also his second wife, Portunia, (They Sleep to Wake Again).""You're that kid,"" said a girl's voice. ""Bob Owens. Well, you're in really big trouble, Bob Owens.""""It's Bod, actually,"" said Bod, and he looked at them. ""With a D. And you're Jekyll and Hyde.""""It was you,"" said the girl. ""You got to the seventh formers.""""So we're going to teach you a lesson,"" said Nick Farthing, and he smiled without humor.""I quite like lessons,"" said Bod. ""If you paid more attention to yours, you wouldn't have to blackmail younger kids for pocket money.""Nick's brow crinkled. Then he said, ""You're dead, Owens.""Bod shook his head, and he gestured around him. ""I'm not actually,"" he said. ""They are.""""Who are?"" said Mo.""The people in this place,"" said Bod. ""Look. I brought you here to give you a choice-""""You didn't bring us here,"" said Nick.""You're here,"" said Bod. ""I wanted you here. I came here. You followed me. Same thing.""Mo looked around nervously. ""You've got friends here?"" she asked.Bod said, ""You're missing the point, I'm afraid. You two need to stop this. Stop behaving like other people don't matter. Stop hurting people.""Mo grinned a sharp grin. ""For heaven's sake,"" she said to Nick. ""Hit him.""""I gave you a chance,"" said Bod. Nick swung a vicious fist at Bod, who was no longer there, and Nick's fist slammed into the side of the gravestone.""Where did he go?"" said Mo. Nick was swearing and shaking his hand. She looked around the shadowy cemetery, puzzled. ""He was here. You know he was.""Nick had little imagination, and he was not about to start thinking now. ""Maybe he ran away,"" he said.""He didn't run,"" said Mo. ""He just wasn't there anymore."" Mo had an imagination. The ideas were hers. It was twilight in a spooky churchyard, and the hairs on the back of her neck were prickling. ""Something is really, really wrong,"" said Mo. Then she said, in a higher-pitched panicky voice, ""We have to get out of here.""""I'm going to find that kid,"" said Nick Farthing. ""I'm going to beat the stuffing out of him."" Mo felt something unsettled in the pit of her stomach. The shadows seemed to move around them.""Nick,"" said Mo, ""I'm scared.""Fear is contagious. You can catch it. Sometimes all it takes is for someone to say that they're scared for the fear to become real. Mo was terrified, and now Nick was too.Nick didn't say anything. He just ran, and Mo ran close on his heels. The streetlights were coming on as they ran back towards the world, turning the twilight into night, making the shadows into dark places in which anything could be happening.They ran until they reached Nick's house, and they went inside and turned on all the lights, and Mo called her mother and demanded, half crying, to be picked up and driven the short distance to her own house, because she wasn't walking home that night.Bod had watched them run with satisfaction.""That was good, dear,"" said someone behind him, a tall woman in white. ""A nice Fade, first. Then the Fear.""""Thank you,"" said Bod. ""I hadn't even tried the Fear out on living people. I mean, I knew the theory, but. Well.""""It worked a treat,"" she said, cheerfully. ""I'm Amabella Persson.""""Bod. Nobody Owens.""""The live boy? From the big graveyard on the hill? Really?""""Um."" Bod hadn't realized that anyone knew who he was beyond his own graveyard. Amabella was knocking on the side of the tomb. ""Roddy? Portunia? Come and see who's here!""There were three of them there, then, and Amabella was introducing Bod and he was shaking hands and saying, ""Charmed, I am sure,"" because he could greet people politely over nine hundred years of changing manners.""Master Owens here was frightening some children who doubtless deserved it,"" Amabella was explaining.""Good show,"" said Roderick Persson. ""Bounders guilty of reprehensible behavior, eh?""""They were bullies,"" said Bod. ""Making kids hand over their pocket money. Stuff like that.""""A Frightening is certainly a good beginning,"" said Portunia Persson, who was a stout woman, much older than Amabella. ""And what have you planned if it does not work?""""I hadn't really thought-"" Bod began, but Amabella interrupted.""I should suggest that Dreamwalking might be the most efficient remedy. You can Dreamwalk, can you not?""""I'm not sure,"" said Bod. ""Mister Pennyworth showed me how, but I haven't really-well, there's things I only really know in theory, and-""Portunia Persson said, ""Dreamwalking is all very well, but might I suggest a good Visitation? That's the only language that these people understand.""""Oh,"" said Amabella. ""A Visitation? Portunia my dear, I don't really think so--""""No, you don't. Luckily, one of us thinks.""""I have to be getting home,"" said Bod, hastily. ""They'll be worrying about me.""""Of course,"" said the Persson family, and ""Lovely to meet you,"" and ""A very good evening to you, young man."" Amabella Persson and Portunia Persson glared at each other. Roderick Persson said, ""If you'll forgive me asking, but your guardian. He is well?""""Silas? Yes, he's fine.""""Give him our regards. I'm afraid a small churchyard like this, well, we're never going to meet an actual member of the Honour Guard. Still. It's good to know that they're there.""""Good night,"" said Bod, who had no idea what the man was talking about, but filed it away for later. ""I'll tell him.""He picked up his bag of schoolbooks, and he walked home, taking comfort in the shadows.Going to school with the living did not excuse Bod from his lessons with the dead. The nights were long, and sometimes Bod would apologize and crawl to bed exhausted before midnight. Mostly, he just kept going.Mr. Pennyworth had little to complain of these days. Bod studied hard, and asked questions. Tonight Bod asked about Hauntings, getting more and more specific, which exasperated Mr. Pennyworth, who had never gone in for that sort of thing himself.""How exactly do I make a cold spot in the air?"" he asked, and ""I think I've got Fear down, but how do I take it up all the way to Terror?"" and Mr. Pennyworth sighed and hurrumphed and did his best to explain, and it was gone four in the morning before they were done.Bod was tired at school the next day. The first class was History-a subject Bod mostly enjoyed, although he often had to resist the urge to say that it hadn't happened like that, not according to people who had been there anyway-but this morning Bod was fighting to stay awake.He was doing all he could do to concentrate on the lesson, so he was not paying attention to much else going on around him. He was thinking about King Charles the First, and about his parents, of Mr. and Mrs. Owens and of the other family, the one he could not remember, when there was a knock on the door. The class and Mr. Kirby all looked to see who was there (it was a year seven, who had been sent to borrow a textbook). And as they turned, Bod felt something stab in the back of his hand. He did not cry out. He just looked up.Nick Farthing grinned down at him, a sharpened pencil in his fist. ""I'm not afraid of you,"" whispered Nick Farthing. Bod looked at the back of his hand. A small drop of blood welled up where the point of the pencil had punctured it.Mo Quilling passed Bod in the corridor that afternoon, her eyes so wide he could see the whites all around them.""You're weird,"" she said. ""You don't have any friends.""""I didn't come here for friends,"" said Bod truthfully. ""I came here to learn.""Mo's nose twitched. ""Do you know how weird that is?"" She asked. ""Nobody comes to school to learn. I mean, you come because you have to.""Bod shrugged.""I'm not afraid of you,"" she said. ""Whatever trick you did yesterday. You didn't scare me.""""Okay,"" said Bod, and he walked on down the corridor.He wondered if he had made a mistake, getting involved. He had made a mis-step in judgment, that was for certain. Mo and Nick had begun to talk about him, probably the year sevens had as well. Other kids were looking at him, pointing him out to each other. He was becoming a presence, rather than an absence, and that made him uncomfortable. Silas had warned him to keep a low profile, told him to go through school partly Faded, but everything was changing.He talked to his guardian that evening, told him the whole story. He was not expecting Silas's reaction.""I cannot believe,"" said Silas, ""that you could have been so...so stupid. Everything I told you about remaining just this side of invisibility. And now you've become the talk of the school?""""Well, what did you want me to do?""""Not this,"" said Silas. ""It's not like the olden times. They can keep track of you, Bod. They can find you."" Silas's unmoving exterior was like the hard crust of rock over molten lava. Bod knew how angry Silas was only because he knew Silas. He seemed to be fighting his anger, controlling it.Bod swallowed.""What should I do?"" he said, simply.""Don't go back,"" said Silas. ""This school business was an experiment. Let us simply acknowledge that it was not a successful one.""Bod said nothing. Then he said, ""It's not just the learning stuff. It's the other stuff. Do you know how nice it is to be in a room filled with people and for all of them to be breathing?""""It's not something in which I've ever taken pleasure,"" said Silas. ""So. You don't go back to school tomorrow.""""I'm not running away. Not from Mo or Nick or school. I'd leave here first.""""You will do as you are told, boy,"" said Silas, a knot of velvet anger in the darkness.""Or what?"" said Bod, his cheeks burning. ""What would you do to keep me here? Kill me?"" And he turned on his heel and began to walk down the path that led to the gates and out of the graveyard.Silas began to call the boy back, then he stopped, and stood there in the night alone.At the best of times his face was unreadable. Now his face was a book written in a language long forgotten, in an alphabet unimagined. Silas wrapped the shadows around him like a blanket, and stared after the way the boy had gone, and did not move to follow.Nick Farthing was in his bed, asleep and dreaming of pirates on the sunny blue sea, when it all went wrong. One moment he was the captain of his own pirate ship-a happy place, crewed by obedient eleven-year-olds, except for the girls, who were all a year or two older than Nick and who looked especially pretty in their pirate costumes-and the next he was alone on the deck, and a huge, dark ship the size of an oil tanker, with ragged black sails and a skull for a figurehead, was crashing through the storm towards him.And then, in the way of dreams, he was standing on the black deck of the new ship, and someone was looking down at him.""You're not afraid of me,"" said the man standing over him.Nick looked up. He was scared, in his dream, scared of this dead-faced man in pirate costume, his hand on the hilt of a cutlass.""Do you think you're a pirate, Nick?"" asked his captor, and suddenly something about him seemed familiar to Nick.""You're that kid,"" he said. ""Bob Owens.""""I,"" said his captor, ""am Nobody. And you need to change. Turn over a new leaf. Reform. All that. Or things will get very bad for you.""""Bad how?""""Bad in your head,"" said the Pirate King, who was now only the boy from his class and they were in the school hall, not the deck of the pirate ship, although the storm had not abated and the floor of the hall pitched and rolled like a ship at sea.""This is a dream,"" Nick said.""Of course it's a dream,"" said the other boy. ""I would have to be some kind of monster to do this in real life.""""What can you do to me in a dream?"" asked Nick. He smiled. ""I'm not afraid of you. You've still got my pencil in the back of your hand."" He pointed to the back of Bod's hand, at the black mark the graphite point had made.""I was hoping it wouldn't have to be like this,"" said the other boy. He tipped his head on one side as if he was listening to something. ""They're hungry,"" he said.""What are?"" asked Nick.""The things in the cellar. Or belowdecks. Depends whether this is a school or a ship, doesn't it?""Nick felt himself beginning to panic. ""It isn't...spiders...is it?"" he said.""It might be,"" said the other boy. ""You'll find out, won't you?""Nick shook his head.""No,"" he said. ""Please no.""""Well,"" said the other boy. ""It's all up to you, isn't it? Change your ways or visit the cellar.""The noise got louder-a scuttling sort of a scuffling noise, and while Nick Farthing had no idea what it was, he was utterly, completely certain that whatever it would turn out to be would be the most scary terrible thing he had ever-would ever-encounter...He woke up screaming.Bod heard the scream, a shout of terror, and felt the satisfaction of a job well done.He was standing on the pavement outside Nick Farthing's house, his face damp from the thick night mist. He was exhilarated and exhausted: he had felt barely in control of the Dreamwalk, had been all too aware that there was nothing else in the dream but Nick and himself, and that all Nick had been scared of was a noise.But Bod was satisfied. The other boy would hesitate before tormenting smaller kids.And now?Bod put his hands in his pockets and began to walk, not certain where he was going. He would leave the school, he thought, just as he had left the graveyard. He would go somewhere no one knew him, and he would sit in a library all day and read books and listen to people breathing. He wondered if there were still deserted islands in the world, like the one on which Robinson Crusoe had been shipwrecked. He could go and live on one of those.Bod did not look up. If he had, he would have seen a pair of watery blue eyes watching him intently from a bedroom window.He stepped into an alley, feeling more comfortable out of the light.""Are you running away, then?"" said a girl's voice.Bod said nothing.""That's the difference between the living and the dead, ennit?"" said the voice. It was Liza Hempstock talking, Bod knew, although the witch-girl was nowhere to be seen. ""The dead dun't disappoint you. They've had their life, done what they've done. We dun't change. The living, they always disappoint you, dun't they? You meet a boy who's all brave and noble, and he grows up to run away.""""That's not fair!"" said Bod.""The Nobody Owens I knew wouldn't've run off from the graveyard without saying so much as a fare-thee-well to those who cared for him. You'll break Mistress Owens's heart.""Bod had not thought of that. He said, ""I had a fight with Silas.""""So?""""He wants me to come back to the graveyard. To stop school. He thinks it's too dangerous.""""Why? Between your talents and my bespellment, they'll barely notice you.""""I was getting involved. There were these kids bullying other kids. I wanted them to stop. I drew attention to myself...""Liza could be seen now, a misty shape in the alleyway keeping pace with Bod.""He's out here, somewhere, and he wants you dead,"" she said. ""Him as killed your family. Us in the graveyard, we wants you to stay alive. We wants you to surprise us and disappoint us and impress us and amaze us. Come home, Bod.""""I think...I said things to Silas. He'll be angry.""""If he didn't care about you, you couldn't upset him,"" was all she said.The fallen autumn leaves were slick beneath Bod's feet, and the mists blurred the edges of the world. Nothing was as clean-cut as he had thought it, a few minutes before.""I did a Dreamwalk,"" he said.""How did it go?""""Good,"" he said. ""Well, all right.""""You should tell Mr. Pennyworth. He'll be pleased.""""You're right,"" he said. ""I should.""He reached the end of the alley, and instead of turning right, as he had planned, and off into the world, he turned left, onto the High Street, the road that would take him back to Dunstan Road and the graveyard on the hill.""What?"" said Liza Hempstock. ""What you doin'?""""Going home,"" said Bod. ""Like you said.""There were shop-lights now. Bod could smell the hot grease from the chip shop on the corner. The paving stones glistened.""That's good,"" said Liza Hempstock, now only a voice once more. Then the voice said, ""Run! Or Fade! Something's wrong!""Bod was about to tell her that there was nothing wrong, that she was being foolish, when a large car with a light flashing on the top came veering across the road and pulled up in front of him.Two men got out from it. ""Excuse me, young man,"" said one of the men. ""Police. Might I ask what you're doing out so late?""""I didn't know there was a law against it,"" said Bod.The largest of the policemen opened the rear door of the car. ""Is this the young man you saw, Miss?"" he said.Mo Quilling got out of the car, and looked at Bod, and smiled. ""That's him,"" she said. ""He was in our back garden breaking things. And then he ran away."" She looked Bod in the eye. ""I saw you from my bedroom,"" she said. ""I think he's the one who's been breaking windows.""""What's your name?"" asked the smaller policeman. He had a ginger mustache.""Nobody,"" said Bod. Then, ""Ow,"" because the ginger policeman had taken Bod's ear between finger and thumb, and had given it a hard squeeze. ""Don't give me that,"" said the policeman. ""Just answer the questions politely. Right?""Bod said nothing.""Where exactly do you live?"" asked the policeman.Bod said nothing. He tried to Fade, but Fading-even when boosted by a witch-relies on people's attention sliding away from you, and everybody's attention-not to mention a large pair of official hands-was on him then.Bod said, ""You can't arrest me for not telling you my name or address.""""No,"" said the policeman. ""I can't. But I can take you down to the station until you give us the name of a parent, guardian, responsible adult, into whose care we can release you.""He put Bod into the back of the car, where Mo Quilling sat, with the smile on her face of a cat who has eaten all the canaries. ""I saw you from my front window,"" she said, quietly. ""So I called the police.""""I wasn't doing anything,"" said Bod. ""I wasn't even in your garden. And why are they bringing you out to find me?""""Quiet back there!"" said the large policeman. Everyone was quiet until the car pulled up in front of a house that had to be Mo's. The large policeman opened the door for her, and she got out.""We'll call you tomorrow, let your mom and dad know what we found,"" said the large policeman.""Thanks, Uncle Tam,"" said Mo, and she smiled. ""Just doing my duty.""They drove back through the town in silence, Bod trying to Fade as best he could, with no success. He felt sick and miserable. In one evening, he had had his first real argument with Silas, had attempted to run away from home, had failed to run away, and now failed to return home. He could not tell the police where he lived, or his name. He would spend the rest of his life in a police cell, or in a prison for kids. Did they have prison for kids? he didn't know.""Excuse me? Do they have prisons for kids?"" he asked the men in the front seat.""Getting worried, now, are you?"" said Mo's uncle Tam. ""I don't blame you. You kids. Running wild. Some of you need locking up, I'll tell you.""Bod wasn't sure if that was a yes or a no. He glanced out of the car window. Something huge was flying through the air, above the car and to one side, something darker and bigger than the biggest bird. Something man-size that flickered and fluttered as it moved, like the strobing flight of a bat.The ginger policeman said, ""When we get to the station, best if you just give us your name, tell us who to call to come and get you, we can tell them we gave you a bollocking, they can take you home. See? You cooperate, we have an easy night, less paperwork for everyone. We're your friends.""""You're too easy on him. A night in the cells isn't that hard,"" said the large policeman to his friend. Then he looked back at Bod, and said, ""Unless it's a busy night, and we have to put you in with some of the drunks. They can be nasty.""Bod thought, He's lying! and They're doing this on purpose, the friendly one and the tough one...Then the police car turned a corner, and there was a thump! Something big rode up onto the hood of the car and was knocked off into the dark. A screech of brakes as the car stopped, and the ginger policeman began to swear under his breath.""He just ran out into the road!"" he said. ""You saw it!""""I'm not sure what I saw,"" said the larger policeman. ""You hit something, though.""They got out of the car, shone lights around. The ginger policeman said, ""He was wearing black! You can't see it.""""He's over here,"" shouted the large policeman. The two men hurried over to the body on the ground, holding flashlights.Bod tried the door handles on the backseat. They did not work. And there was a metal grille between the back and the front. Even if he Faded, he was still stuck in the backseat of a police car.He leaned over as far as he could, craning to try and see what had happened, what was on the road.The ginger policeman was crouched beside a body, looking at it. The other, the large one, was standing above it, shining a light down into its face.Bod looked at the face of the fallen body-then he began to bang on the window, frantically, desperately.The large policeman came over to the car.""What?"" he said, irritably.""You hit my-my dad,"" said Bod.""You're kidding.""""It looks like him,"" said Bod. ""Can I look properly?""The large policeman's shoulders slumped. ""Oy! Simon, the kid says it's his dad.""""You've got to be bloody kidding me.""""I think he's serious."" The large policeman opened the door, and Bod got out.Silas was sprawled on his back, on the ground, where the car had knocked him. He was deathly still.Bod's eyes prickled.He said, ""Dad?"" Then he said, ""You killed him."" He wasn't lying, he told himself-not really.""I've called an ambulance,"" said Simon, the ginger-mustached policeman.""It was an accident,"" said the other.Bod crouched by Silas, and he squeezed Silas's cold hand in his. If they had already called an ambulance there was not much time. He said, ""So that's your careers over, then.""""It was an accident-you saw!""""He just stepped out-""""What I saw,"" said Bod, ""is that you agreed to do a favor for your niece, and frighten a kid she's been fighting with at school. So you arrested me without a warrant for being out late, and then when my dad runs out into the road to try and stop you or to find out what was going on, you intentionally ran him over.""""It was an accident!"" repeated Simon.""You've been fighting with Mo at school?"" said Mo's uncle Tam, but he didn't sound convincing.""We're both in Eight B at the Old Town School,"" said Bod. ""And you killed my dad.""Far off, he could hear the sound of sirens.""Simon,"" said the large man, ""we have to talk about this.""They walked over to the other side of the car, leaving Bod alone in the shadows with the fallen Silas. Bod could hear the two policemen talking heatedly-""Your bloody niece!"" was used, and so was ""If you'd kept your eyes on the road!"" Simon jabbed his finger into Tam's chest...Bod whispered, ""They aren't looking. Now."" And he Faded.There was a swirl of deeper darkness, and the body on the ground was now standing beside him.Silas said, ""I'll take you home. Put your arms around my neck.""Bod did, holding tightly to his guardian, and they plunged through the night, heading for the graveyard.""I'm sorry,"" said Bod.""I'm sorry too,"" said Silas.""Did it hurt?"" asked Bod. ""Letting the car hit you like that?""""Yes,"" said Silas. ""You should thank your little witch-friend. She came and found me, told me you were in trouble, and what kind of trouble you were in.""They landed in the graveyard. Bod looked at his home as if it was the first time he had ever seen it. He said, ""What happened tonight was stupid, wasn't it? I mean, I put things at risk.""""More things than you know, young Nobody Owens. Yes.""""You were right,"" said Bod. ""I won't go back. Not to that school, and not like that.""Maureen Quilling had had the worst week of her life: Nick Farthing was no longer speaking to her; her uncle Tam had shouted at her about the Owens kid thing, then told her not to mention anything about that evening ever to anyone, as he could lose his job, and he wouldn't want to be in her shoes if that happened; her parents were furious with her; she felt betrayed by the world; even the year sevens weren't scared of her any longer. It was rotten. She wanted to see that Owens kid, who she blamed for everything that had happened to her so far, writhing in miserable agony. If he thought being arrested was bad...and then she would concoct elaborate revenge schemes in her head, complex and vicious. They were the only thing that made her feel better, and even they didn't really help.If there was one job that gave Mo the creeps, it was cleaning up the science labs-putting away the Bunsen burners, making sure that all test tubes, petri dishes, unused filter papers and the like were returned to their places. She only had to do it, on a strict rotation system, once every two months, but it stood to reason that here, in the worst week of her life, she would be in the science lab.At least Mrs. Hawkins, who taught general sciences, was there, collecting papers, gathering things up at the end of the day. Having her there, having anybody there, was comforting.""You're doing a good job, Maureen,"" said Mrs. Hawkins.A white snake in a jar of preservative stared blindly down at them. Mo said, ""Thanks.""""Aren't there meant to be two of you?"" asked Mrs. Hawkins.""I was supposed to be doing it with the Owens kid,"" said Mo. ""But he hasn't been to school in days now.""The teacher frowned. ""Which one was he?"" she asked, absently. ""I don't have him down on my list.""""Bob Owens. Brownish hair, a bit too long. Didn't talk much. He was the one who named all the bones of the skeleton in the quiz. Remember?""""Not really,"" admitted Mrs. Hawkins.""You must remember! Nobody remembers him! Not even Mr. Kirby!""Mrs. Hawkins pushed the rest of the sheets of paper into her bag and said, ""Well, I appreciate you doing it on your own, dear. Don't forget to wipe down the working surfaces, before you go."" And she went, closing the door behind her.The science labs were old. There were long, dark wooden tables, with gas jets and taps and sinks built in to them, and there were dark wooden shelves upon which were displayed a selection of things in large bottles. The things that floated in the bottles were dead, had been dead for a long time. There was even a yellowed human skeleton in one corner of the room: Mo did not know if it was real or not, but right now it was creeping her out.Every noise she made echoed, in that long room. She turned all of the overhead lights on, even the light on the whiteboard, just to make the place less scary. The room began to feel cold. She wished she could turn up the heat. She walked over to one of the large metal radiators and touched it. It was burning hot. But still, she was shivering.The room was empty and unsettling in its emptiness, and Mo felt as if she were not alone, as if she was being watched.Well, of course I'm being watched, she thought. A hundred dead things in jars are all looking at me, not to mention the skeleton. She glanced up at the shelves.That was when the dead things in the jars began to move. A snake with unseeing milky eyes uncoiled in its alcohol-filled jar. A faceless, spiny sea creature twisted and revolved in its liquid home. A kitten, dead for decades, showed its teeth and clawed the glass.Mo closed her eyes. This isn't happening, she told herself. I'm imagining it. ""I'm not frightened,"" she said, aloud.""That's good,"" said someone, standing in the shadows, by the rear door. ""It seriously sucks to be frightened.""She said, ""None of the teachers even remember you.""""But you remember me,"" said the boy, the architect of all her misfortunes.She picked up a glass beaker and threw it at him, but her aim went wide and it smashed against a wall.""How's Nick?"" asked Bod, as if nothing had happened.""You know how he is,"" she said. ""He won't even talk to me. Just shuts up in class, goes home and does his homework. Probably building model railways.""""Good,"" he said.""And you,"" she said. ""You haven't been at school for a week. You're in such trouble, Bob Owens. The police came in the other day. They were looking for you.""""That reminds me...How's your uncle Tam?"" said Bod.Mo said nothing.""In some ways,"" said Bod, ""you've won. I'm leaving school. And in other ways, you haven't. Have you ever been haunted, Maureen Quilling? Ever looked in the mirror wondering if the eyes looking back at you were yours? Ever sat in an empty room, and realized you were not alone? It's not pleasant.""""You're going to haunt me?"" Her voice trembled.Bod said nothing at all. He just stared at her. In the far corner of the room, something crashed: her bag had slipped off the chair onto the floor and when she looked back, she was alone in the room. Or, at least, there was nobody that she could see in there with her.Her way home was going to be very long and very dark.The boy and his guardian stood at the top of the hill, looking out at the lights of the town.""Does it still hurt?"" asked the boy.""A little,"" said his guardian. ""But I heal fast. I'll soon be as good as ever.""""Could it have killed you? Stepping out in front of that car?""His guardian shook his head. ""There are ways to kill people like me,"" he said. ""But they don't involve cars. I am very old and very tough.""Bod said, ""I was wrong, wasn't I? The whole idea was to do it without anybody noticing. And then I had to get involved with the kids in the school, and the next thing you know, there's police and all sorts of stuff. Because I was selfish.""Silas raised an eyebrow. ""You weren't selfish. You need to be among your own kind. Quite understandable. It's just harder out there in the world of the living, and we cannot protect you out there as easily. I wanted to keep you perfectly safe,"" said Silas. ""But there is only one perfectly safe place for your kind and you will not reach it until all your adventures are over and none of them matter any longer.""Bod rubbed his hand over the stone of Thomas R. Stout (1817-1851. Deeply regretted by all who knew him), feeling the moss crumble beneath his fingers.""He's still out there,"" said Bod. ""The man who killed my first family. I still need to learn about people. Are you going to stop me leaving the graveyard?""""No. That was a mistake and one that we have both learned from.""""Then what?""""We should do our best to satisfy your interest in stories and books and the world. There are libraries. There are other ways. And there are many situations in which there might be other, living people around you, like the theater or the cinema.""""What's that? Is it like football? I enjoyed watching them play football at school.""""Football. Hmm. That's usually a little early in the day for me,"" said Silas. ""But Miss Lupescu could take you to see a football match the next time she's here.""""I'd like that,"" said Bod.They began to walk down the hill. Silas said, ""We have both left too many tracks and traces in the last few weeks. They are still looking for you, you know.""""You said that before,"" said Bod. ""How do you know? And who are they? And what do they want?""But Silas only shook his head, and would be drawn no further, and with that, for the time being, Bod had to be satisfied.
TGB_ch7	TGB	The graveyard book	7	18250	101902	CHAPTER SEVEN - Every Man JackSILAS HAD BEEN PREOCCUPIED for the previous several months. He had begun to leave the graveyard for days, sometimes weeks, at a time. Over Christmas, Miss Lupescu had come out for three weeks in his place, and Bod had shared her meals in her little flat in the Old Town. She had even taken him to a football match, as Silas had promised that she would, but she had gone back to the place she called ""The Old Country"" after squeezing Bod's cheeks and calling him Nimini, which had become her pet name for him.Now Silas was gone, and Miss Lupescu also. Mr. and Mrs. Owens were sitting in Josiah Worthington's tomb talking to Josiah Worthington. None of them was happy.Josiah Worthington said, ""You mean to say that he did not tell either of you where he was going or how the child was to be cared for?""When the Owenses shook their heads, Josiah Worthington said, ""Well, where is he?""Neither Owens was able to answer. Master Owens said, ""He's never been gone for so long before. And he promised, when the child came to us, promised he would be here, or someone else would be here to help us care for him. He promised.""Mrs. Owens said, ""I worry that something must have happened to him."" She seemed close to tears, and then her tears turned to anger, and she said, ""This is too bad of him! Is there no way to find him, to call him back?""""None that I know,"" said Josiah Worthington. ""But I believe that he's left money in the crypt, for food for the boy.""""Money!"" said Mrs. Owens. ""What use is money?""""Bod will be needing money if he's to go out there to buy food,"" began Mr. Owens, but Mrs. Owens turned on him.""You're all as bad as each other!"" she said.She left the Worthington tomb, then, and she went looking for her son, whom she found, as she expected to, at the top of the hill, staring out over the town.""Penny for your thoughts,"" said Mrs. Owens.""You don't have a penny,"" said Bod. He was fourteen, now, and taller than his mother.""I've got two in the coffin,"" said Mrs. Owens. ""Probably a bit green by now, but I've still got them right enough.""""I was thinking about the world,"" said Bod. ""How do we even know that the person who killed my family is still alive? That he's out there?""""Silas says he is,"" said Mrs. Owens.""But Silas doesn't tell us anything else.""Mrs. Owens said, ""He means only the best for you. You know that.""""Thanks,"" said Bod, unimpressed. ""So where is he?""Mrs. Owens made no reply.Bod said, ""You saw the man who killed my family, didn't you? On the day you adopted me.""Mrs. Owens nodded.""What was he like?""""Mostly, I had eyes for you. Let me see...he had dark hair, very dark. And I was frightened of him. He had a sharp face. Hungry and angry all at once, he was. Silas saw him off.""""Why didn't Silas just kill him?"" said Bod, fiercely. ""He should have just killed him then.""Mrs. Owens touched the back of Bod's hand with her cold fingers. She said, ""He's not a monster, Bod.""""If Silas had killed him back then, I would be safe now. I could go anywhere.""""Silas knows more than you do about all this, more than any of us do. And Silas knows about life and death,"" said Mrs. Owens. ""It's not that easy.""Bod said, ""What was his name? The man who killed them.""""He didn't say it. Not then.""Bod put his head on one side, and stared at her with eyes as grey as thunderclouds. ""But you know it, don't you?""Mrs. Owens said, ""There's nothing you can do, Bod.""""There is. I can learn. I can learn everything I need to know, all I can. I learned about ghoul-gates. I learned to Dreamwalk. Miss Lupescu taught me how to watch the stars. Silas taught me silence. I can Haunt. I can Fade. I know every inch of this graveyard.""Mrs. Owens reached out a hand, touched her son's shoulder. ""One day,"" she said...and then she hesitated. One day, she would not be able to touch him. One day, he would leave them. One day. And then she said, ""Silas told me the man who killed your family was called Jack.""Bod said nothing. Then he nodded. ""Mother?""""What is it, son?""""When will Silas come back?""The midnight wind was cold and it came from the north.Mrs. Owens was no longer angry. She feared for her son. She said only, ""I wish I knew, my darling boy, I wish I knew.""Scarlett Amber Perkins was fifteen, and, at that moment, sitting on the upper deck of the elderly bus, she was a mass of angry hate. She hated her parents for splitting up. She hated her mother for moving away from Scotland, hated her father because he didn't seem to care that she had gone. She hated this town for being so different-nothing like Glasgow, where she had grown up-and she hated it because every now and again she would turn a corner and see something and the world would all become achingly, horribly familiar.She had lost it with her mother that morning. ""At least in Glasgow I had friends!"" Scarlett had said, and she wasn't quite shouting and she wasn't quite sobbing. ""I'll never see them again!"" All her mother had said in reply was, ""At least you're somewhere you've been before. I mean, we lived here when you were little.""""I don't remember,"" said Scarlett. ""And it's not like I still know anyone. Do you want me to find my old friends from when I was five? Is that what you want?""And her mother said, ""Well, I'm not stopping you.""Scarlett had gone through the whole of the school day angry, and she was angry now. She hated her school and she hated the world, and right now she particularly hated the town bus service.Every day, when school was over, the 97 bus to the City Center would take her from her school gates all the way to the end of the street where her mother had rented a small flat. She had waited at the bus-stop on that gusty April day for almost half an hour and no 97 buses had appeared, so when she saw a 121 bus with City Center as its destination she had climbed aboard. But where her bus always turned right, this one turned left, into the Old Town, past the municipal gardens in the Old Town square, past the statue of Josiah Worthington, Bart., and then crept up a winding hill lined with high houses, as Scarlett's heart sank and her anger was replaced with misery.She walked downstairs, edged forward, eyed the sign telling her not to speak to the driver when the vehicle was in motion, and said, ""Excuse me. I wanted to go to Acacia Avenue.""The driver, a large woman, her skin even darker than Scarlett's said, ""You should have got the 97, then.""""But this goes to the City Center.""""Eventually. But even when you get there, you'll still need to get back."" The woman sighed. ""Best thing you can do, get off here, walk back down the hill, there's a bus-stop in front of the town hall. From there, you can catch the number 4 or the 58, both of them will take you most of the way to Acacia Avenue. You could get off by the sports center and walk up from there. You got all that?""""The 4 or the 58.""""I'll let you off here."" It was a request stop on the side of the hill, just past a large pair of open iron gates, and it looked uninviting and dismal. Scarlett stood in the open doorway of the bus until the bus driver said, ""Go on. Hop it."" She stepped down onto the pavement and the bus belched black smoke and roared away.The wind rattled the trees on the other side of the wall.Scarlett began to walk back down the hill-this was why she needed a mobile phone, she thought. If she was so much as five minutes late, her mother would freak, but she still wouldn't buy Scarlett a phone of her own. Oh well. She would have to endure another shouting match. It wouldn't be the first and it wouldn't be the last.By now she was level with the open gates. She glanced inside and...""That's odd,"" she said, aloud.There's an expression, déja vu, that means that you feel like you've been somewhere before, that you've somehow already dreamed it or experienced it in your mind. Scarlett had experienced it-the knowledge that a teacher was just about to tell them that she'd been to Inverness on holiday, or that someone had dropped a spoon in just that way before. This was different. This wasn't a feeling that she had been here before. This was the real thing.Scarlett walked through the open gates into the graveyard.A magpie flew up as she walked in, a flash of black and white and iridescent green, and settled in the branches of a yew tree, watching her. Around that corner, she thought, is a church, with a bench in front of it, and she turned a corner to see a church-much smaller than the one in her head, a sinister blocky little Gothic building of grey stone, with a jutting spire. In front of it was a weathered wooden bench. She walked over, sat down on the bench, and swung her legs as if she was still a little girl.""Hullo. Um, hullo?"" said a voice from behind her. ""Awful cheek of me, I know, but would you help me hold down this, er, just really need another pair of hands, if it's not too much trouble.""Scarlett looked around, and saw a man in a fawn-colored raincoat squatting in front of a gravestone. He was holding a large sheet of paper which was blowing about in the wind. She hurried over to him.""You hold on to it here,"" said the man. ""One hand here, one hand there, that's it. Frightful imposition, I know. Ridiculously grateful.""He had a biscuit tin next to him, and from the tin he pulled what looked like a crayon the size of a small candle. He began rubbing it back and forth across the stone with easy, practiced movements.""There we go,"" he said, cheerfully. ""And here she comes...oops. A wiggly bit, down at the bottom here, I think it's meant to be ivy-the Victorians loved putting ivy on things, deeply symbolic you know...and there we are. You can let go now.""He stood up, ran one hand through his grey hair. ""Ow. Needed to stand. Legs got a bit pins-and-needlesy,"" he said. ""So. What do you reckon to that?""The actual headstone was covered in green and yellow lichen, and so worn and faded as to almost be undecipherable, but the rubbing was clear. ""Majella Godspeed, Spinster of this Parish, 1791-1870, Lost to All But Memory,"" Scarlett read aloud.""And probably now lost even to that,"" said the man. His hair was thinning, and he smiled hesitantly and blinked at her through small, round glasses which made him look a little like a friendly owl.A large raindrop splashed down on the paper, and the man hurriedly rolled it up and grabbed his tin box of crayons. Another handful of raindrops, and Scarlett picked up the portfolio the man pointed to, propped up beside a nearby gravestone, and followed him into the tiny porch of the church, where the rain could not touch them.""Thank you so much,"" said the man. ""I don't think it's really going to rain much. Weather forecast for this afternoon said mostly sunny.""As if in reply, the wind gusted coldly and the rain began to beat down in earnest.""I know what you're thinking,"" the gravestone-rubbing man said to Scarlett.""You do?"" she said. She had been thinking, My mum will kill me.""You're thinking, is this a church or a funeral chapel? And the answer is, as far as I can ascertain, that on this site there was indeed a small church, and the original graveyard would have been its churchyard. That's as long ago as eight, perhaps nine hundred A. D. Rebuilt and extended several times in there. But there was a fire here in the 1820s and by that time it was already much too small for the area. People around here were using St. Dunstan's in the village square as their parish church, so when they came to rebuild here, they made it a funeral chapel, keeping many of the original features-the stained glass windows in the far wall are said to be original...""""Actually,"" said Scarlett, ""I was thinking that my mum is going to kill me. I got the wrong bus and I am already so late home...""""Good Lord, you poor thing,"" said the man. ""Look, I only live just down the road. You wait here-"" And with that he thrust his portfolio, his tin of crayons, and his rolled-up sheet of paper into her hands and he set off at a trot down to the gates, his shoulders hunched against the driving rain. A couple of minutes later, Scarlett saw the lights of a car and heard the sound of a car horn.Scarlett ran down to the gates, where she could see the car, an elderly green Mini. The man she had been talking to was sitting in the driver's seat. He wound down his window.""Come on,"" he said. ""Where exactly am I taking you?""Scarlett stood there, the rain running down her neck. ""I don't take rides from strangers,"" she said.""Quite right too,"" said the man. ""But one good turn deserves, and, um, all that. Here, put the stuff in the back before it gets soaked."" He pulled open the passenger door, and Scarlett leaned inside and put his graverubbing equipment down on the backseat as best she could. ""Tell you what,"" he said. ""Why don't you phone your mother-you can use my phone-and tell her my car's number plate? You can do it from inside the car. You're getting soaked out there.""Scarlett hesitated. Rain was beginning to plaster her hair down. It was cold.The man reached over and handed her his mobile phone. Scarlett looked at it. She realized she was more afraid of calling her mother than she was of getting into the car. Then she said, ""I could call the police too, couldn't I?""""You certainly can, yes. Or you can walk home. Or you can just call your mother and ask her to come and pick you up.""Scarlett got into the passenger seat and closed the door. She kept hold of the man's phone.""Where do you live?"" the man asked.""You really don't have to. I mean, you could just take me to the bus stop...""""I'll take you home. Address?""""102a Acacia Avenue. It's off the main road, a wee bit past the big sports center...""""You are out of your way, aren't you? Right. Let's get you home."" He took off the handbrake, swung the car around, and drove down the hill.""Been living here long?"" he said.""Not really. We moved here just after Christmas. We lived here when I was five, though.""""Is that a brogue I detect in your accent?""""We've been living in Scotland for ten years. There, I sounded like everyone else, and then I came down here, and now I stick out like a sore thumb."" She had wanted it to sound like a joke, but it was true, and she could hear it as she said it. Not funny, just bitter.The man drove to Acacia Avenue, parked in front of the house, then insisted on coming up to the front door with her. When the door was opened he said, ""Frightfully sorry. I took the liberty of bringing your daughter back to you. Obviously, you taught her well, shouldn't accept rides from strangers. But, well, it was raining, she took the wrong bus, wound up on the other side of town. Bit of a mess all around really. Say you can find it in your heart to forgive. Forgive her. And, um, me.""Scarlett expected her mother to shout at both of them, and was surprised and relieved when her mother only said, Well, you couldn't be too careful these days, and was Mr. Um a teacher, and would he like a cup of tea?Mr. Um said his name was Frost, but she should call him Jay, and Mrs. Perkins smiled and said he should call her Noona, and she'd put the kettle on.Over tea, Scarlett told her mother the story of her wrong bus adventure, and how she had found herself at the graveyard, and how she met Mr. Frost by the little church...Mrs. Perkins dropped her teacup.They were sitting around the table in the kitchen, so the cup didn't fall very far, and it didn't break, just spilled tea. Mrs. Perkins apologized awkwardly, and went and got a cloth from the sink to mop it up.Then she said, ""The graveyard on the hill, in the Old Town? That one?""""I live over that way,"" said Mr. Frost. ""Been doing a lot of grave-rubbings. And you know it's technically a nature reserve?""Mrs. Perkins said, ""I know,"" thin-lipped. Then she said, ""Thank you so much for giving Scarlett a ride home, Mr. Frost."" Each word might have been an ice cube. Then, ""I think you should leave now.""""I say, that's a bit much,"" said Frost, amiably. ""Didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Was it something I said? The rubbings, they're for a local history project, it's not as if I'm, you know, digging up bones or anything.""For a heartbeat, Scarlett thought that her mother was going to strike Mr. Frost, who just looked worried. But Mrs. Perkins shook her head and said, ""Sorry, family history. Not your fault."" As if she was making a conscious effort, she said, brightly, ""You know, Scarlett actually used to play in that graveyard when she was little. This is, oh, ten years ago. She had an imaginary friend, too. A little boy called Nobody.""A smile twitched at the corner of Mr. Frost's lips. ""A ghostie?""""No, I don't think so. He just lived there. She even pointed out the tomb he lived in. So I suppose he was a ghost. Do you remember, love?""Scarlett shook her head. ""I must have been a funny kid,"" she said.""I'm sure that you were nothing of the, um,"" said Mr. Frost. ""You are raising a fine girl here, Noona. Well, lovely cup of tea. Always a joy to make new friends. I'll be toddling off now. Got to make myself a little dinner, then I've got a meeting of the Local History Society.""""You're making your own dinner?"" said Mrs. Perkins.""Yes, making it. Well, defrosting it really. I'm also a master of the boil-in-the-bag. Eating for one. Living on my own. Bit of a crusty old bachelor. Actually, in the papers, that always means gay, doesn't it? Not gay, just never met the right woman."" And for a moment, he looked rather sad.Mrs. Perkins, who hated to cook, announced that she always cooked too much food at the weekend, and as she ushered Mr. Frost out into the hall, Scarlett heard him agree that he would love to come round for dinner on Saturday night.When Mrs. Perkins came back from the front hall, all she said to Scarlett was, ""I hope you've done your homework.""Scarlett was thinking about the afternoon's events as she lay in bed that night listening to the sound of the cars grinding their way along the main road. She had been there, in that graveyard, when she was little. That was why everything had seemed so familiar.In her mind she imagined and she remembered, and somewhere in there she fell asleep, but in sleep she still walked the paths of the graveyard. It was night, but she could see everything as clearly as if it were day. She was on the side of a hill. There was a boy of about her own age standing with his back to her, looking at the lights of the city.Scarlett said, ""Boy? What're you doing?""He looked around, seemed to have trouble focusing. ""Who said that?"" and then, ""Oh, I can see you, sort of. Are you Dreamwalking?""""I think I'm dreaming,"" she agreed.""Not quite what I meant,"" said the boy. ""Hullo. I'm Bod.""""I'm Scarlett,"" she said.He looked at her again, as if he were seeing her for the first time. ""Of course, you are! I knew you looked familiar. You were in the graveyard today with that man, the one with the paper.""""Mr. Frost,"" she said. ""He's really nice. He gave me a lift home."" Then she said, ""Did you see us?""""Yeah. I keep an eye on most things that happen in the graveyard.""""What kind of a name is Bod?"" she asked.""It's short for Nobody.""""Of course!"" said Scarlett. ""That's what this dream is about. You're my imaginary friend, from when I was little, all grown up.""He nodded.He was taller than she was. He wore grey, although she could not have described his clothes. His hair was too long, and she thought it had been some time since he had received a haircut.He said, ""You were really brave. We went deep into the hill and we saw the Indigo Man. And we met the Sleer.""Something happened, then, in her head. A rushing and a tumbling, a whirl of darkness and a crash of images...""I remember,"" said Scarlett. But she said it to the empty darkness of her bedroom, and heard nothing in reply but the low trundle of a distant lorry, making its way through the night.Bod had stores of food, the kind that lasted, cached in the crypt, and more in some of the chillier tombs and vaults and mausoleums. Silas had made sure of that. He had enough food to keep him going for a couple of months. Unless Silas or Miss Lupescu was there, he simply would not leave the graveyard.He missed the world beyond the graveyard gates, but he knew it was not safe out there. Not yet. The graveyard, though, was his world and his domain, and he was proud of it and loved it as only a fourteen-year-old boy can love anything.And yet...In the graveyard, no one ever changed. The little children Bod had played with when he was small were still little children; Fortinbras Bartleby, who had once been his best friend, was now four or five years younger than Bod was, and they had less to talk about each time they saw each other; Thackeray Porringer was Bod's height and age, and seemed to be in much better temper with him; he would walk with Bod in the evenings, and tell stories of unfortunate things that had happened to his friends. Normally the stories would end in the friends being hanged until they were dead for no offense of theirs and by mistake, although sometimes they were simply transported to the American Colonies and they didn't have to be hanged unless they came back.Liza Hempstock, who had been Bod's friend for the last six years, was different in another way; she was less likely to be there for him when Bod went down to the nettle-patch to see her, and on the rare occasions when she was, she would be short-tempered, argumentative, and often downright rude.Bod talked to Mr. Owens about this, and, after a few moments' reflection, his father said, ""It's just women, I reckon. She liked you as a boy, probably isn't sure who you are now you're a young man. I used to play with one little girl down by the duck-pond every day until she turned about your age, and then she threw an apple at my head and did not say another word to me until I was seventeen.""Mrs. Owens sniffed. ""It was a pear I threw,"" she said, tartly, ""and I was talking to you again soon enough, for we danced a measure at your cousin Ned's wedding, and that was but two days after your sixteenth birthday.""Mr. Owens said, ""Of course you are right, my dear."" He winked at Bod, to tell him that it was none of it serious. And then he mouthed ""Seventeen,"" to show that, really, it was.Bod had allowed himself no friends among the living. That way, he had realized back during his short-lived schooldays, lay only trouble. Still, he had remembered Scarlett, had missed her for years after she went away, had long ago faced the fact he would never see her again. And now she had been here in his graveyard, and he had not known her...He was wandering deeper into the tangle of ivy and trees that made the graveyard's northwest quadrant so dangerous. Signs advised visitors to keep out, but the signs were not needed. It was uninviting and creepy once you were past the ivy-tangle that marked the end of the Egyptian Walk and the black doors in the mock-Egyptian walls that led to people's final resting places. In the northwest, nature had been reclaiming the graveyard for almost a hundred years, and the stones were tipped over, graves were forgotten or simply lost beneath the green ivy and the leaf-fall of fifty years. Paths were lost and impassable.Bod walked with care. He knew the area well, and he knew how dangerous it could be.When Bod was nine he had been exploring in just this part of the world when the soil had given way beneath him, tumbling him into a hole almost twenty feet down. The grave had been dug deep, to accommodate many coffins, but there was no headstone and only one coffin, down at the bottom, containing a rather excitable medical gentleman named Carstairs who seemed thrilled by Bod's arrival and insisted on examining Bod's wrist (which Bod had twisted in the tumble, grabbing onto a root) before he could be persuaded to go and fetch help.Bod was making his way through the northwest quadrant, a sludge of fallen leaves, a tangle of ivy, where the foxes made their homes and fallen angels stared up blindly, because he had an urge to talk to the Poet.Nehemiah Trot was the Poet's name, and his gravestone, beneath the greenery, read:Here lies the mortal remains ofNEHEMIAH TROTPOET1741-1774SWANS SING BEFORE THEY DIEBod said, ""Master Trot? Might I ask you for advice?""Nehemiah Trot beamed, wanly. ""Of course, brave boy. The advice of poets is the cordiality of kings! How may I smear unction on your, no, not unction, how may I give balm to your pain?""""I'm not actually in pain. I just-well, there's a girl I used to know, and I wasn't sure if I should find her and talk to her or if I should just forget about it.""Nehemiah Trot drew himself up to his full height, which was less than Bod's, raised both hands to his chest excitedly, and said, ""Oh! You must go to her and implore her. You must call her your Terpsichore, your Echo, your Clytemnestra. You must write poems for her, mighty odes-I shall help you write them-and thus-and only thus-shall you win your true love's heart.""""I don't actually need to win her heart. She's not my true love,"" said Bod. ""Just someone I'd like to talk to.""""Of all the organs,"" said Nehemiah Trot, ""the tongue is the most remarkable. For we use it both to taste our sweet wine and bitter poison, thus also do we utter words both sweet and sour with the same tongue. Go to her! Talk to her!""""I shouldn't.""""You should, sir! You must! I shall write about it, when the battle's lost and won.""""But if I Unfade for one person, it makes it easier for other people to see me...""Nehemiah Trot said, ""Ah, list to me, young Leander, young Hero, young Alexander. If you dare nothing, then when the day is over, nothing is all you will have gained.""""Good point."" Bod was pleased with himself, and glad he had thought of asking the Poet for advice. Really, he thought, if you couldn't trust a poet to offer sensible advice, who could you trust? Which reminded him...""Mister Trot?"" said Bod. ""Tell me about revenge.""""Dish best served cold,"" said Nehemiah Trot. ""Do not take revenge in the heat of the moment. Instead, wait until the hour is propitious. There was a Grub Street hack named O'Leary-an Irishman, I should add-who had the nerve, the confounded cheek to write of my first slim volume of poems, A Nosegay of Beauty Assembled for Gentlemen of Quality, that it was inferior doggerel of no worth whatsoever, and that the paper it was written on would have been better used as-no, I cannot say. Let us simply agree that it was a most vulgar statement.""""But you got your revenge on him?"" asked Bod, curious.""On him and on his entire pestilent breed! Oh, I had my revenge, Master Owens, and it was a terrible one. I wrote, and had published, a letter, which I nailed to the doors of the public houses in London where such low scribbling folk were wont to frequent. And I explained that, given the fragility of the genius poetical, I would henceforth write not for them, but only for myself and posterity, and that I should, as long as I lived, publish no more poems-for them! Thus I left instructions that upon my death my poems were to be buried with me, unpublished, and that only when posterity realized my genius, realized that hundreds of my verses had been lost-lost!-only then was my coffin to be disinterred, only then could my poems be removed from my cold dead hand, to finally be published to the approbation and delight of all. It is a terrible thing to be ahead of your time.""""And after you died, they dug you up, and they printed the poems?""""Not yet, no. But there is still plenty of time. Posterity is vast.""""So...that was your revenge?""""Indeed. And a mightily powerful and cunning one at that!""""Ye-es,"" said Bod, unconvinced.""Best. Served. Cold,"" said Nehemiah Trot, proudly.Bod left the northwest of the graveyard, returned through the Egyptian Walk to the more orderly paths and untangled ways, and as the dusk fell, he wandered back towards the old chapel-not because he hoped Silas had returned from his travels, but because he had spent his life visiting the chapel at dusk, and it felt good to have a rhythm. And anyway, he was hungry.Bod slipped through the crypt door, down into the crypt. He moved a cardboard box filled with curled and damp parish papers and took out a carton of orange juice, an apple, a box of bread sticks, and a block of cheese, and he ate while pondering how and whether he would seek out Scarlett-he would Dreamwalk, perhaps, since that was how she had come to him...He headed outside, was on his way to sit on the grey wooden bench, when he saw something and he hesitated. There was someone already there, sitting on his bench. She was reading a magazine.Bod Faded even more, became a part of the graveyard, no more important than a shadow or a twig.But she looked up. She looked straight at him, and she said, ""Bod? Is that you?""He said nothing. Then he said, ""Why can you see me?""""I almost couldn't. At first I thought you were a shadow or something. But you look like you did in my dream. You sort of came into focus.""He walked over to the bench. He said, ""Can you actually read that? Isn't it too dark for you?""Scarlett closed the magazine. She said, ""It's odd. You'd think it would be too dark, but I could read it fine, no problem.""""Are you..."" He trailed off, uncertain of what he had wanted to ask her. ""Are you here on your own?""She nodded. ""I helped Mr. Frost do some grave-rubbings, after school. And then I told him I wanted to sit and think here, for a bit. When I'm done here, I promised to go and have a cup of tea with him and he'll run me home. He didn't even ask why. Just said he loves sitting in graveyards too, and that he thinks they can be the most peaceful places in the world."" Then she said, ""Can I hug you?""""Do you want to?"" said Bod.""Yes.""""Well then."" He thought for a moment. ""I don't mind if you do.""""My hands won't go through you or anything? You're really there?""""You won't go through me,"" he told her, and she threw her arms around him and squeezed him so tightly he could hardly breathe. He said, ""That hurts.""Scarlett let go. ""Sorry.""""No. It was nice. I mean. You just squeezed more than I was expecting.""""I just wanted to know if you were real. All these years I thought you were just something in my head. And then I sort of forgot about you. But I didn't make you up, and you're back, you're in my head, and you're in the world too.""Bod smiled. He said, ""You used to wear a sort of a coat, it was orange, and whenever I saw that particular color orange, I'd think of you. I don't suppose you still have the coat.""""No,"" she said. ""Not for a long time. It would be a wee bit too small for me now.""""Yes,"" said Bod. ""Of course.""""I should go home,"" said Scarlett. ""I thought I could come up on the weekend, though."" And then, seeing the expression on Bod's face, she said, ""Today's Wednesday.""""I'd like that.""She turned to go. Then she said, ""How will I find you, next time?""Bod said, ""I'll find you. Don't worry. Just be on your own and I'll find you.""She nodded, and was gone.Bod walked back into the graveyard and up the hill, until he reached the Frobisher mausoleum. He did not enter it. He climbed up the side of the building, using the thick ivy root as a foothold, and he pulled himself up onto the stone roof, where he sat and thought looking out at the world of moving things beyond the graveyard, and he remembered the way that Scarlett had held him and how safe he had felt, if only for a moment, and how fine it would be to walk safely in the lands beyond the graveyard, and how good it was to be master of his own small world.Scarlett said that she didn't want a cup of tea, thank you. Or a chocolate biscuit. Mr. Frost was concerned.""Honestly,"" he told her, ""you look like you've seen a ghost. Well, a graveyard, not a bad place to see one, if you were going to, um, I had an aunt once who claimed her parrot was haunted. She was a scarlet macaw. The parrot. The aunt was an architect. Never knew the details.""""I'm fine,"" said Scarlett. ""It was just a long day.""""I'll give you a lift home then. Any idea what this says? Been puzzling over it for half an hour."" He indicated a grave-rubbing on the little table, held flat by a jam jar in each corner. ""Is that name Gladstone, do you think? Could be a relative of the prime minister. But I can't make out anything else.""""'Fraid not,"" said Scarlett. ""But I'll take another look when I come out on Saturday.""""Is your mother likely to put in an appearance?""""She said she'd drop me off here in the morning. Then she has to go and get groceries for our dinner. She's cooking a roast chicken.""""Do you think,"" asked Mr. Frost, hopefully, ""there are likely to be roast potatoes?""""I expect so, yes.""Mr. Frost looked delighted. Then he said, ""I wouldn't want to put her out of her way, I mean.""""She's loving it,"" said Scarlett, truthfully. ""Thank you for giving me a lift home.""""More than welcome,"" said Mr. Frost. They walked together down the steps in Mr. Frost's high narrow house, to the little entrance hall at the bottom of the stairs.In Krakow, on Wawel Hill, there are caves called the Dragon's Den, named after a long dead dragon. These are the caves that the tourists know about. There are caves beneath those caves that the tourists do not know and do not ever get to visit. They go down a long way, and they are inhabited.Silas went first, followed by the grey hugeness of Miss Lupescu, padding quietly on four feet just behind him. Behind them was Kandar, a bandage-wrapped Assyrian mummy with powerful eagle-wings and eyes like rubies, who was carrying a small pig.There had originally been four of them, but they had lost Haroun in a cave far above, when the Ifrit, as naturally overconfident as are all of its race, had stepped into a space bounded by three polished bronze mirrors and had been swallowed up in a blaze of bronze light. In moments the Ifrit could only be seen in the mirrors, and no longer in reality. In the mirrors his fiery eyes were wide open, and his mouth was moving as if he was shouting at them to leave and beware, and then he faded and was lost to them.Silas, who had no problems with mirrors, had covered one of them with his coat, rendering the trap useless.""So,"" said Silas. ""Now there are only three of us.""""And a pig,"" said Kandar.""Why?"" asked Miss Lupescu, with a wolf-tongue, through wolf teeth. ""Why the pig?""""It's lucky,"" said Kandar.Miss Lupescu growled, unconvinced.""Did Haroun have a pig?"" asked Kandar, simply.""Hush,"" said Silas. ""They are coming. From the sound of it, there are many of them.""""Let them come,"" whispered Kandar.Miss Lupescu's hackles were rising. She said nothing, but she was ready for them, and it was only by an effort of will that she did not throw back her head and howl.""It's beautiful up this way,"" said Scarlett.""Yes,"" said Bod.""So, your family were all killed?"" said Scarlett. ""Does anyone know who did it?""""No. Not that I know. My guardian only says that the man who did it is still alive, and that he'll tell me the rest of what he knows one day.""""One day?""""When I'm ready.""""What's he scared of? That you'd strap on your gun and ride out to wreak vengeance on the man who killed your family?""Bod looked at her seriously. ""Well, obviously,"" he said. ""Not a gun, though. But yes. Something like that.""""You're joking.""Bod said nothing. His lips were tight-pressed together. He shook his head. Then he said, ""I'm not joking.""It was a bright and sunny Saturday morning. They were just past the entrance to the Egyptian Walk, out of the direct sunlight, under the pines and the sprawling monkey puzzle tree.""Your guardian. Is he a dead person too?""Bod said, ""I don't talk about him.""Scarlett looked hurt. ""Not even to me?""""Not even to you.""""Well,"" she said. ""Be like that.""Bod said, ""Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean-"" just as Scarlett said, ""I promised Mr. Frost I wouldn't be too long. I'd better be getting back.""""Right,"" said Bod, worried he had offended her, unsure what he should say to make anything better.He watched Scarlett head off on the winding path back to the chapel. A familiar female voice said, with derision, ""Look at her! Miss high and mighty!"" but there was no one to be seen.Bod, feeling awkward, walked back to the Egyptian Walk. Miss Lillibet and Miss Violet had let him store a cardboard box filled with old paperback books in their vault, and he wanted to find something to read.Scarlett helped Mr. Frost with his grave-rubbings until midday, when they stopped for lunch. He offered to buy her fish and chips as a thank-you, and they walked down to the fish and chip shop at the bottom of the road, and as they walked back up the hill they ate their steaming fish and chips, drenched in vinegar and glittering with salt, out of paper bags.Scarlett said, ""If you wanted to find out about a murder, where would you look? I already tried the Internet.""""Um. Depends. What kind of murder are we talking about?""""Something local, I think. About thirteen or fourteen years ago. A family was killed around here.""""Crikey,"" said Mr. Frost. ""This really happened?""""Oh yes. Are you all right?""""Not really. Bit too, well, bit of a wimp, really. Things like that, I mean, local true crime, you don't like to think about it. Things like that, happening here. Not something I'd expect a girl of your age to be interested in.""""It's not actually for me,"" admitted Scarlett. ""It's for a friend.""Mr. Frost finished off the last of his fried cod. ""The library, I suppose. If it's not on the Internet, it'll be in their newspaper files. What set you off after this?""""Oh."" Scarlett wanted to lie as little as possible. She said, ""A boy I know. He was asking about it.""""Definitely the library,"" said Mr. Frost. ""Murder. Brr. Gives me the shivers.""""Me too,"" said Scarlett. ""A bit."" Then, hopefully, ""Could you maybe, possibly, drop me off at the library, this afternoon?""Mr. Frost bit a large chip in half, chewed it, and looked at the rest of the chip, disappointed. ""They get cold so fast, don't they, chips. One minute, you're burning your mouth on them, the next you're wondering how they cool off so quickly.""""I'm sorry,"" said Scarlett. ""I shouldn't be asking for rides everywhere-""""Not at all,"" said Mr. Frost. ""Just wondering how best to organize this afternoon, and whether or not your mother likes chocolates. Bottle of wine or chocolates? Not really sure. Both maybe?""""I can make my own way home from the library,"" said Scarlett. ""And she loves chocolates. So do I.""""Chocolates it is, then,"" said Mr. Frost, relieved. They had reached the middle of the row of high, terraced houses on the hill, and the little green Mini parked outside. ""Get in. I'll run you over to the library.""The library was a square building, all brick and stone, dating back to the beginning of the last century. Scarlett looked around, and then went up to the desk.The woman said, ""Yes?""Scarlett said, ""I wanted to see some old newspaper clippings.""""Is it for school?"" said the woman.""It's local history,"" said Scarlett, nodding, proud that she hadn't actually lied.""We've got the local paper on microfiche,"" said the woman. She was large, and had silver hoops in her ears. Scarlett could feel her heart pounding in her chest; she was certain she looked guilty or suspicious, but the woman led her into a room with boxes that looked like computer screens, and showed her how to use them, to project a page of the newspaper at a time onto the screen. ""One day we'll have it all digitized,"" said the woman. ""Now, what dates are you after?""""About thirteen or fourteen years ago,"" said Scarlett. ""I can't be more specific than that. I'll know it when I see it.""The woman gave Scarlett a small box with five years' worth of newspapers on microfilm in it. ""Go wild,"" she said.Scarlett assumed that the murder of a family would have been front page news but instead, when she eventually found it, it was almost buried on page five. It had happened in October, thirteen years earlier. There was no color in the article, no description, just an understated list of events: Architect Ronald Dorian, 36, his wife, Carlotta, 34, a publisher, and their daughter, Misty, 7, were found dead at 33 Dunstan Road. Foul play is suspected. A police spokesman said that it was too early to comment at this stage in their investigations, but that significant leads are being followed.There was no mention of how the family died, and nothing said about a missing baby. In the weeks that followed, there was no follow-up, and the police did not ever comment, not that Scarlett could see.But that was it. She was certain: 33 Dunstan Road. She knew the house. She had been in there.She returned the box of microfilm to the front desk, thanked the librarian, and walked home in the April sunshine. Her mother was in the kitchen cooking-not entirely successfully, judging from the smell of burnt-bottom-of-the-saucepan that filled most of the flat. Scarlett retreated to her bedroom and opened the windows wide to let the burnt smell out, then she sat on her bed and made a phone call.""Hello? Mr. Frost?""""Scarlett. Everything still all right for this evening? How's your mother?""""Oh, it's all under control,"" said Scarlett, which was what her mother had said when she had asked. ""Um, Mr. Frost, how long have you lived at your house?""""How long? About, well, four months now.""""How did you find it?""""Estate agents' window. It was empty and I could afford it. Well, more or less. Well, I wanted something within walking distance of the graveyard, and this was perfect.""""Mister Frost."" Scarlett wondered how to say it, and then just said it. ""About thirteen years ago, three people were murdered in your house. The Dorian family.""There was a silence at the other end of the phone.""Mister Frost? Are you there?""""Um. Still here, Scarlett. Sorry. Not the sort of thing you expect to hear. It's an old house, I mean, you expect things to happen a long time ago. But not...well, what happened?""Scarlett wondered how much she could tell him. She said, ""There was a little piece on it in an old newspaper, it only gave the address and nothing else. I don't know how they died or anything.""""Well. Good lord."" Mr. Frost sounded more intrigued by the news than Scarlett could have expected. ""This, young Scarlett, is where we local historians come into our own. Leave it with me. I'll find out everything I can and report back.""""Thank you,"" said Scarlett, relieved.""Um. I assume this phone call is because if Noona thought there were murders going on in my home, even thirteen-year-old ones, you'd never be allowed to see me or the graveyard again. So, um, suppose I won't mention it unless you do.""""Thank you, Mr. Frost!""""See you at seven. With chocolates.""Dinner was remarkably pleasant. The burnt smell had gone from the kitchen. The chicken was good, the salad was better, the roast potatoes were too crispy, but a delighted Mr. Frost had proclaimed that this was precisely the way he liked them, and had taken a second helping.The flowers were popular, the chocolates, which they had for dessert, were perfect, and Mr. Frost sat and talked then watched television with them until about 10 P.M., when he said that he needed to get home.""Time, tide, and historical research wait for no man,"" he said. He shook Noona's hand with enthusiasm, winked at Scarlett conspiratorially, and was out the door.Scarlett tried to find Bod in her dreams that night; she thought of him as she went to sleep, imagined herself walking the graveyard looking for him, but when she did dream it was of wandering around Glasgow city center with her friends from her old school. They were hunting for a specific street, but all they found was a succession of dead ends, one after another.Deep beneath the hill in Krakow, in the deepest vault beneath the caves they call the Dragon's Den, Miss Lupescu stumbled and fell.Silas crouched beside her and cradled Miss Lupescu's head in his hands. There was blood on her face, and some of it was hers.""You must leave me,"" she said. ""Save the boy."" She was halfway now, halfway between grey wolf and woman, but her face was a woman's face.""No,"" said Silas. ""I won't leave you.""Behind him, Kandar cradled its piglet like a child might hold a doll. The mummy's left wing was shattered, and it would never fly again, but its bearded face was implacable.""They will come back, Silas,"" Miss Lupescu whispered. ""Too soon, the sun will rise.""""Then,"" said Silas, ""we must deal with them before they are ready to attack. Can you stand?""""Da. I am one of the Hounds of God,"" said Miss Lupescu. ""I will stand."" She lowered her face into the shadows, flexed her fingers. When she raised her head again, it was a wolf's head. She put her front paws down on the rock, and, laboriously, pushed herself up into a standing position: a grey wolf bigger than a bear, her coat and muzzle flecked with blood.She threw back her head and howled a howl of fury and of challenge. Her lips curled back from her teeth and she lowered her head once more. ""Now,"" growled Miss Lupescu. ""We end this.""Late on Sunday afternoon the telephone rang. Scarlett was sitting downstairs, laboriously copying faces from the manga she had been reading onto scrap paper. Her mother picked up the phone.""Funny, we were just talking about you,"" said her mother, although they hadn't been. ""It was wonderful,"" her mother continued. ""I had the best time. Honestly, it was no trouble. The chocolates? They were perfect. Just perfect. I told Scarlett to tell you, any time you want a good dinner, you just let me know."" And then, ""Scarlett? Yes, she's here. I'll put her on. Scarlett?""""I'm just here, Mum,"" said Scarlett. ""You don't have to shout."" She took the phone. ""Mister Frost?""""Scarlett?"" He sounded excited. ""The. Um. The thing we were talking about. The thing that happened in my house. You can tell this friend of yours that I found out-um, listen, when you said 'a friend of yours' did you mean it in the sense of 'we're actually talking about you,' or is there a real person, if it's not a personal question-""""I've got a real friend who wants to know,"" said Scarlett, amused.Her mother shot her a puzzled look.""Tell your friend that I did some digging-not literally, more like rummaging, well, a fair amount of actual looking around-and I think I might have unearthed some very real information. Stumbled over something hidden. Well, not something I think we should spread around...I, um. I found things out.""""Like what?"" asked Scarlett.""Look...don't think I'm mad. But, well, as far as I can tell, three people were killed. One of them-the baby, I think-wasn't. It wasn't a family of three, it was a family of four. Only three of them died. Tell him to come and see me, your friend. I'll fill him in.""""I'll tell him,"" said Scarlett. She put down the phone, her heart beating like a snare.Bod walked down the narrow stone stairs for the first time in six years. His footsteps echoed in the chamber inside the hill.He reached the bottom of the steps and waited for the Sleer to manifest. And he waited, and waited, but nothing appeared, nothing whispered, nothing moved.He looked around the chamber, untroubled by the deep darkness, seeing it as the dead see. He walked over to the altar stone set in the floor, where the cup and the brooch and the stone knife sat.He reached down and touched the edge of the knife. It was sharper than he had expected, and it nicked the skin of his finger.IT IS THE TREASURE OF THE SLEER, whispered a triple voice, but it sounded smaller than he remembered, more hesitant.Bod said, ""You're the oldest thing here. I came to talk to you. I want advice.""A pause. NOTHING COMES TO THE SLEER FOR ADVICE. THE SLEER GUARDS. THE SLEER WAITS.""I know. But Silas isn't here. And I don't know who else to talk to.""Nothing was said. Just a silence in reply, that echoed of dust and loneliness.""I don't know what to do,"" Bod said, honestly. ""I think I can find out about who killed my family. Who wanted to kill me. It means leaving the graveyard, though.""The Sleer said nothing. Smoke-tendrils twined slowly around the inside of the chamber.""I'm not frightened of dying,"" said Bod. ""It's just, so many people I care for have spent so much time keeping me safe, teaching me, protecting me.""Again, silence.Then he said, ""I have to do this on my own.""YES.""That's all, then. Sorry I bothered you.""It whispered into Bod's head, then, in a voice that was a sleek insinuating glide, THE SLEER WAS SET TO GUARD THE TREASURE UNTIL OUR MASTER RETURNED. ARE YOU OUR MASTER?""No,"" said Bod.And then, with a hopeful whine, WILL YOU BE OUR MASTER?""I'm afraid not.""IF YOU WERE OUR MASTER, WE COULD HOLD YOU IN OUR COILS FOREVER. IF YOU WERE OUR MASTER, WE WOULD KEEP YOU SAFE AND PROTECT YOU UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND NEVER LET YOU ENDURE THE DANGERS OF THE WORLD.""I am not your master.""NO.Bod felt the Sleer writhing through his mind. It said, THEN FIND YOUR NAME. And his mind was empty, and the room was empty, and Bod was alone.Bod walked back up the stairs carefully yet quickly. He had come to a decision and needed to act fast, while the decision still burned in his mind.Scarlett was waiting for him on the bench by the chapel. ""Well?"" she said.""I'll do it. Come on,"" he said, and side by side they walked the path down to the graveyard gates.Number 33 was a tall house, spindly-thin, in the middle of a terraced row. It was red-brick and unmemorable. Bod looked at it uncertainly, wondering why it did not seem familiar, or special. It was only a house, like any other. There was a small concreted space in front of it that wasn't a garden, a green Mini parked on the street. The front door had once been painted a bright blue, but had been dimmed by time and the sun.""Well?"" said Scarlett.Bod knocked on the door. There was nothing, then a clatter of feet on the stairs from inside, and the door opened to reveal an entryway and stairs. Framed in the doorway was a bespectacled man with receding grey hair, who blinked at them, then stuck out his hand at Bod, and smiled nervously, and said, ""You must be Miss Perkins's mysterious friend. Good to meet you.""""This is Bod,"" said Scarlett.""Bob?""""Bod. With a D,"" she said. ""Bod, this is Mr. Frost.""Bod and Frost shook hands. ""Kettle's on,"" said Mr. Frost. ""What say we swap information over a cuppa?""They followed him up the steps to a kitchen, where he poured three mugs of tea, then led them into a small sitting room. ""The house just keeps going up,"" he said. ""The toilet's on the next floor up, and my office, then bedrooms above that. Keeps you fit, all the stairs.""They sat on a large, extremely purple sofa (""It was already here when I came""), and they sipped their tea.Scarlett had worried that Mr. Frost would ask Bod lots of questions, but he didn't. He just seemed excited, as if he had identified the lost gravestone of someone famous and desperately wanted to tell the world. He kept moving impatiently in his chair, as if he had something enormous to impart to them and not blurting it out immediately was a physical strain.Scarlett said, ""So what did you find out?""Mr. Frost said, ""Well, you were right. I mean, this was the house where those people were killed. And it...I think the crime was...well, not exactly hushed up, but forgotten about, let go...by the authorities.""""I don't understand,"" said Scarlett. ""Murders don't get swept under the carpet.""""This one was,"" said Frost. He drained his tea. ""There are people out there who have influence. It's the only explanation for that, and for what happened to the youngest child...""""And what was that?"" asked Bod.""He lived,"" said Frost. ""I'm sure of it. But there wasn't a manhunt. A missing toddler normally would be national news. But they, um, they must have squashed it somehow.""""Who are they?"" asked Bod.""The same people who had the family killed.""""Do you know any more than that?""""Yes. Well, a little..."" Frost trailed off. ""I'm sorry. I'm. Look. Given what I found. It's all too incredible.""Scarlett was starting to feel frustrated. ""What was? What did you find?""Frost looked shamefaced. ""You're right. I'm sorry. Getting into keeping secrets. Not a good idea. Historians don't bury things. We dig them up. Show people. Yes."" He stopped, hesitated, then he said, ""I found a letter. Upstairs. It was hidden under a loose floorboard."" He turned to Bod. ""Young man, would I be correct in assuming your, well, your interest in this business, this dreadful business, is personal?""Bod nodded.""I won't ask any more,"" said Mr. Frost, and he stood up. ""Come on,"" he said to Bod. ""Not you, though,"" to Scarlett, ""not yet. I'll show him. And if he says it's all right, I'll show you as well. Deal?""""Deal,"" said Scarlett.""We won't be long,"" said Mr. Frost. ""Come on, lad.""Bod stood up, darted a concerned look at Scarlett. ""It's okay,"" she said, and smiled at him as reassuringly as she could. ""I'll wait here for you.""She watched their shadows as they walked out of the room and up the stairs. She felt nervous, but expectant. She wondered what Bod would learn, and was happy that he would learn it first. It was his story, after all. It was his right.Out on the stairs, Mr. Frost led the way.Bod looked around as he walked up toward the top of the house, but nothing seemed familiar. It all seemed strange.""All the way to the very top,"" said Mr. Frost. They went up another flight of stairs. He said, ""I don't-well, you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but-um, you're the boy, aren't you?""Bod said nothing.""Here we are,"" said Mr. Frost. He turned the key in the door at the top of the house, pushed it open, and they went inside.The room was small, an attic room with a sloping ceiling. Thirteen years before, it had held a crib. It barely held the man and the boy.""Stroke of luck, really,"" said Mr. Frost. ""Under my own nose, so to speak."" He crouched down, pulled back the threadbare carpet.""So you know why my family were murdered?"" asked Bod.Mr. Frost said, ""It's all in here."" He reached down to a short length of floorboard and pushed at it until he was able to lever it out. ""This would have been the baby's room,"" said Mr. Frost. ""I'll show you the...you know, the only thing we don't know is just who did it. Nothing at all. We don't have the tiniest clue.""""We know he has dark hair,"" said Bod, in the room that had once been his bedroom. ""And we know that his name is Jack.""Mr. Frost put his hand down into the empty space where the floorboard had been. ""It's been almost thirteen years,"" he said. ""And hair gets thin and goes gray, in thirteen years. But yes, that's right. It's Jack.""He straightened up. The hand that had been in the hole in the floor was holding a large, sharp knife.""Now,"" said the man Jack. ""Now, boy. Time to finish this.""Bod stared at him. It was as if Mr. Frost had been a coat or a hat the man had been wearing, that he had now discarded. The affable exterior had gone.The light glinted on the man's spectacles, and on the blade of the knife.A voice called up to them from further down the stairs-Scarlett's. ""Mr. Frost? There's someone knocking at the front door. Should I get it?""The man Jack only glanced away for a moment, but Bod knew that the moment was all he had, and he Faded, as completely, as utterly as he could. The man Jack looked back to where Bod had been, then stared around the room, puzzlement and rage competing on his face. He took a step further into the room, his head swinging from side to side like an old tiger scenting prey.""You're here somewhere,"" growled the man Jack. ""I can smell you!""Behind him, the little door to the attic bedroom slammed closed, and as he swung around he heard the key turn in the lock.The man Jack raised his voice. ""It buys you moments, but it won't stop me, boy,"" he called through the locked door. Then added, simply, ""We have unfinished business, you and I.""Bod threw himself down the stairs, bouncing into the walls, almost tumbling headlong in his rush to reach Scarlett.""Scarlett!"" he said, when he saw her. ""It's him! Come on!""""It's who? What are you talking about?""""Him! Frost. He's Jack. He tried to kill me!""A bang! from above as the man Jack kicked at the door.""But."" Scarlett tried to make sense of what she was hearing, ""But he's nice.""""No,"" said Bod, grabbing her hand and pulling her down the stairs, into the hallway. ""No, he's not.""Scarlett pulled open the front door.""Ah. Good evening, young lady,"" said the man at the door, looking down at her. ""We are looking for Mr. Frost. I believe this is his neck of the woods."" He had silver-white hair, and he smelled of cologne.""Are you friends of his?"" she asked.""Oh yes,"" said a smaller man, standing just behind. He had a small black mustache and was the only one of the men to wear a hat.""Certainly are,"" said a third, a younger man, huge and Nordic blond.""Every man Jack of us,"" said the last of the men, wide and bull-like, with a massive head. His skin was brown.""He. Mr. Frost. He had to go out,"" she said.""But his car's here,"" said the white-haired man, as the blond one said, ""Who are you, anyway?""""He's a friend of my mum's,"" said Scarlett.She could see Bod, now, on the other side of the group of men, gesturing frantically to her to leave the men and follow him.She said, as breezily as she could, ""He just popped out. Popped out for a newspaper. From the corner shop down there."" And she closed the door behind her, stepped around the men and began to walk away.""Where are you going?"" asked the man with the mustache.""I've got a bus to catch,"" she said. Scarlett walked up the hill towards the bus-stop and the graveyard, and did not, resolutely did not, look back.Bod walked beside her. Even to Scarlett he seemed shadowy in the deepening dusk, like something that was almost not there, a shimmer of heat haze, a skittery leaf that for a moment had seemed to be a boy.""Walk faster,"" said Bod. ""They're all looking at you. But don't run.""""Who are they?"" asked Scarlett, quietly.""I don't know,"" said Bod. ""But they all felt weird. Like they weren't properly people. I want to go back and listen to them.""""Of course they're people,"" said Scarlett, and she walked up the hill as fast as she could without actually running, no longer certain that Bod was by her side.The four men stood at the door to number 33. ""I don't like this,"" said the big man with the bull-neck.""You don't like this, Mr. Tar?"" said the white-haired man. ""None of us like it. All wrong. Everything's going wrong.""""Krakow's gone. They aren't answering. And after Melbourne and Vancouver..."" said the man with the mustache. ""For all we know, we four are all that's left.""""Quiet, please, Mr. Ketch,"" said the white-haired man. ""I'm thinking.""""Sorry, sir,"" said Mr. Ketch, and he patted his mustache with one gloved finger, looked up the hill and down again, and whistled through his teeth.""I think...we should go after her,"" said the bull-necked man, Mr. Tar.""I think you people should listen to me,"" said the white-haired man. ""I said quiet. And what I meant was, quiet.""""Sorry, Mr. Dandy,"" said the blond man.They were quiet.In the silence, they could hear thumping sounds coming from high inside the house.""I'm going in,"" said Mr. Dandy. ""Mr. Tar, you're with me. Nimble and Ketch, get that girl. Bring her back.""""Dead or alive?"" asked Mr. Ketch, with a smug smile.""Alive, you moron,"" said Mr. Dandy. ""I want to know what she knows.""""Maybe she's one of them,"" said Mr. Tar. ""The ones who done for us in Vancouver and Melbourne and-""""Get her,"" said Mr. Dandy. ""Get her now."" The blond man and the hat-and-mustache hurried up the hill.Mr. Dandy and Mr. Tar stood outside the door to number 33.""Force it,"" said Mr. Dandy.Mr. Tar put his shoulder against the door and began to lean his weight on it. ""It's reinforced,"" he said. ""Protected.""Mr. Dandy said, ""Nothing one Jack can do that another can't fix."" He pulled off his glove, put his hand against the door, muttered something in a language older than English. ""Now try it,"" he said.Tar leaned against the door, grunted and pushed. This time the lock gave and the door swung open.""Nicely done,"" said Mr. Dandy.There was a crashing noise from far above them, up at the top of the house.The man Jack met them halfway down the stairs. Mr. Dandy grinned at him, without any humor but with perfect teeth. ""Hello, Jack Frost,"" he said. ""I thought you had the boy.""""I did,"" said the man Jack. ""He got away.""""Again?"" Jack Dandy's smile grew wider and chillier and even more perfect. ""Once is a mistake, Jack. Twice is a disaster.""""We'll get him,"" said the man Jack. ""This ends tonight.""""It had better,"" said Mr. Dandy.""He'll be in the graveyard,"" said the man Jack. The three men hurried down the stairs.The man Jack sniffed the air. He had the scent of the boy in his nostrils, a prickle at the nape of his neck. He felt like all this had happened years before. He paused, pulled on his long black coat, which had hung in the front hall, incongruous beside Mr. Frost's tweed jacket and fawn mackintosh.The front door was open to the street, and the daylight had almost gone. This time the man Jack knew exactly which way to go. He did not pause, but simply walked out of the house, and hurried up the hill towards the graveyard.The graveyard gates were closed when Scarlett reached them. Scarlett pulled at them desperately, but the gates were padlocked for the night. And then Bod was beside her. ""Do you know where the key is?"" she asked.""We don't have time,"" said Bod. He pushed close to the metal bars. ""Put your arms around me.""""You what?""""Just put your arms around me and close your eyes.""Scarlett stared at Bod, as if daring him to try something, then she held him tightly and screwed her eyes shut. ""Okay.""Bod leaned against the bars of the graveyard gates. They counted as part of the graveyard, and he hoped that his Freedom of the Graveyard might just, possibly, just this time, cover other people too. And then, like smoke, Bod slipped though the bars.""You can open your eyes,"" he said.She did.""How did you do that?""""This is my home,"" he said. ""I can do things here.""The sound of shoes slapping against the pavement, and two men were on the other side of the gates, rattling them, pulling at them.""Hul-lo,"" said Jack Ketch, with a twitch of his mustache, and he smiled at Scarlett through the bars like a rabbit with a secret. He had a black silk cord tied around his left forearm, and now he was tugging at it with his gloved right hand. He pulled it off his arm and into his hand, testing it, running it from hand to hand as if he was about to make a cat's cradle. ""Come on out, girlie. It's all right. No one's going to hurt you.""""We just need you to answer some questions,"" said the big blond man, Mr. Nimble. ""We're on official business."" (He lied. There was nothing official about the Jacks of All Trades, although there had been Jacks in governments and in police forces and in other places besides.)""Run!"" said Bod to Scarlett, pulling at her hand. She ran.""Did you see that?"" said the Jack they called Ketch.""What?""""I saw somebody with her. A boy.""""The boy?"" asked the Jack called Nimble.""How would I know? Here. Give me a hand up."" The bigger man put his hands out, linked them to make a step, and Jack Ketch's black-clad foot went into it. Lifted up, he scrambled onto the top of the gates and jumped down to the drive, landing on all fours like a frog. He stood up, said, ""Find another way in. I'm going after them."" And he sprinted off up the winding path that led into the graveyard.Scarlett said, ""Just tell me what we're doing."" Bod was walking fast through the twilit graveyard, but he was not running, not yet.""How do you mean?""""I think that man wanted to kill me. Did you see how he was playing with that black cord?""""I'm sure he does. That man Jack-your Mister Frost-he was going to kill me. He's got a knife.""""He's not my Mister Frost. Well, I suppose he is, sort of. Sorry. Where are we going?""""First we put you somewhere safe. Then I deal with them.""All around Bod, the inhabitants of the graveyard were waking and gathering, worried and alarmed.""Bod?"" said Caius Pompeius. ""What is happening?""""Bad people,"" said Bod. ""Can our lot keep an eye on them? Let me know where they are at all times. We have to hide Scarlett. Any ideas?""""The chapel crypt?"" said Thackeray Porringer.""First place they'll look.""""Who are you talking to?"" asked Scarlett, staring at Bod as if he had gone mad.Caius Pompeius said, ""Inside the hill?""Bod thought. ""Yes. Good call. Scarlett, do you remember the place where we found the Indigo Man?""""Kind of. A dark place. I remember there wasn't anything to be scared of.""""I'm taking you up there.""They hurried up the path. Scarlett could tell that Bod was talking to people as he went, but could only hear his side of the conversation. It was like hearing someone talk on a phone. Which reminded her...""My mum's going to go spare,"" she said. ""I'm dead.""""No,"" said Bod. ""You're not. Not yet. Not for a long time."" Then, to someone else, ""Two of them, now. Together? Okay.""They reached the Frobisher mausoleum. ""The entrance is behind the bottom coffin on the left,"" Bod said. ""If you hear anyone coming and it's not me, go straight down to the very bottom...do you have anything to make light?""""Yeah. A little LED thing on my keyring.""""Good.""He pulled open the door to the mausoleum. ""And be careful. Don't trip or anything.""""Where are you going?"" asked Scarlett.""This is my home,"" said Bod. ""I'm going to protect it.""Scarlett squeezed the LED keyring, and went down on her hands and knees. The space behind the coffin was tight, but she went though the hole into the hill and pulled the coffin back as best she could. In the dim LED light she could see stone steps. She stood upright, and, hand on the wall, walked down three steps, then stopped and sat, hoping that Bod knew what he was doing, and she waited.Bod said, ""Where are they now?""His father said, ""One fellow's up by the Egyptian Walk, looking for you. His friend's waiting down by the alley wall. Three others are on their way over, climbing up the alley wall on all the big bins.""""I wish Silas was here. He'd make short work of them. Or Miss Lupescu.""""You don't need them,"" said Mr. Owens encouragingly.""Where's Mum?""""Down by the alley wall.""""Tell her I've hidden Scarlett in the back of the Frobisher's place. Ask her to keep an eye on her if anything happens to me.""Bod ran through the darkened graveyard. The only way into the northwest part of the graveyard was through the Egyptian Walk. And to get there he would have to go past the little man with the black silk rope. A man who was looking for him, and who wanted him dead...He was Nobody Owens, he told himself. He was a part of the graveyard. He would be fine.He nearly missed the little man-the Jack called Ketch-as he hurried into the Egyptian Walk. The man was almost part of the shadows.Bod breathed in, Faded as deeply as he could Fade, and moved past the man like dust blown on an evening breeze.He walked down the green-hung length of the Egyptian Walk, and then, with an effort of will, he became as obvious as he could, and kicked at a pebble.He saw the shadow by the arch detach itself and come after him, almost as silent as the dead.Bod pushed through the trailing ivy that blocked the Walk and into the northwest corner of the graveyard. He would have to time this just right, he knew. Too fast and the man would lose him, yet if he moved too slowly a black silk rope would wrap itself around his neck, taking his breath with it and all his tomorrows.He pushed noisily through the tangle of ivy, disturbing one of the graveyard's many foxes, which sprinted off into the undergrowth. It was a jungle here, of fallen headstones and headless statues, of trees and holly bushes, of slippery piles of half-rotted fallen leaves, but it was a jungle that Bod had explored since he had been old enough to walk and to wander.Now he was hurrying carefully, stepping from root-tangle of ivy to stone to earth, confident that this was his graveyard. He could feel the graveyard itself trying to hide him, to protect him, to make him vanish, and he fought it, worked to be seen.He saw Nehemiah Trot, and hesitated.""Hola, young Bod!"" called the poet. ""I hear that excitement is the master of the hour, that you fling yourself through these dominions like a comet across the firmament. What's the word, good Bod?""""Stand there,"" said Bod. ""Just where you are. Look back the way I came. Tell me when he comes close.""Bod skirted the ivy-covered Carstairs grave, and then he stood, panting as if out of breath, with his back to his pursuer.And he waited. It was only for a few seconds, but it felt like a small forever.(""He's here, lad,"" said Nehemiah Trot. ""About twenty paces behind you."")The Jack called Ketch saw the boy in front of him. He pulled his black silk cord tight between his hands. It had been stretched around many necks, over the years, and had been the end of every one of the people it had embraced. It was very soft and very strong and invisible to X-rays.Ketch's mustache moved, but nothing else. He had his prey in his sight, and did not want to startle it. He began to advance, silent as a shadow.The boy straightened up.Jack Ketch darted forward, his polished black shoes almost soundless on the leaf-mold.(""He comes, lad!"" called Nehemiah Trot.)The boy turned around, and Jack Ketch made a leap towards him-And Mr. Ketch felt the world tumbling away beneath him. He grabbed at the world with one gloved hand, but tumbled down and down into the old grave, all of twenty feet, before crash-landing on Mr. Carstairs's coffin, splintering the coffin-lid and his ankle at the same time.""That's one,"" said Bod, calmly, although he felt anything but calm.""Elegantly accomplished,"" said Nehemiah Trot. ""I shall compose an Ode. Would you like to stay and listen?""""No time,"" said Bod. ""Where are the other men?""Euphemia Horsfall said, ""Three of them are on the southwestern path, heading up the hill.""Tom Sands said, ""And there's another. Right now he's just walking around the chapel. He's the one who's been all around the graveyard for the last month. But there's something different about him.""Bod said, ""Keep an eye on the man in with Mr. Carstairs-and please apologize to Mr. Carstairs for me...""He ducked under a pine-branch and loped around the hill, on the paths when it suited him, off the paths, jumping from monument to stone, when that was quicker.He passed the old apple tree. ""There's four of them, still,"" said a tart female voice. ""Four of them, and all killers. And the rest of them won't all of them fall into open graves to oblige you.""""Hullo, Liza. I thought you were angry at me.""""I might be and I mightn't,"" she said, nothing more than a voice. ""But I'm not going to let them cut you up, nohow.""""Then trip them for me, trip them and confuse them and slow them down. Can you do that?""""While you runs away again? Nobody Owens, why don't you just Fade, and hide in your mam's nice tomb, where they'll never find you, and soon enough Silas will be back to take care of them-""""Maybe he will and maybe he won't,"" said Bod. ""I'll meet you by the lightning tree.""""I am still not talking to you,"" said Liza Hempstock's voice, proud as a peacock and pert as a sparrow.""Actually, you are. I mean, we're talking right now.""""Only during this emergency. After that, not a word.""Bod made for the lightning tree, an oak that had been burned by lightning twenty years ago and now was nothing more than a blackened limb clutching at the sky.He had an idea. It was not fully formed. It depended on whether he could remember Miss Lupescu's lessons, remember everything he had seen and heard as a child.It was harder to find the grave than he had expected, even looking for it, but he found it-an ugly grave tipped at an odd angle, its stone topped by a headless, waterstained angel that had the appearance of a gargantuan fungus. It was only when he touched it, and felt the chill, that he knew it for certain.He sat down on the grave, forced himself to become entirely visible.""You've not Faded,"" said Liza's voice. ""Anyone could find you.""""Good,"" said Bod. ""I want them to find me.""""More know Jack Fool than Jack Fool knows,"" said Liza.The moon was rising. It was huge now and low in the sky. Bod wondered if it would be overdoing it if he began to whistle.""I can see him!""A man ran towards him, tripping and stumbling, two other men close behind.Bod was aware of the dead clustered around them, watching the scene, but he forced himself to ignore them. He made himself more comfortable on the ugly grave. He felt like the bait in a trap, and it was not a good feeling.The bull-like man was the first to reach the grave, followed closely by the man with the white hair who had done all the talking, and the tall blond man.Bod stayed where he was.The man with the white hair said, ""Ah. The elusive Dorian boy, I presume. Astonishing. There's our Jack Frost hunting the whole world over, and here you are, just where he left you, thirteen years ago.""Bod said, ""That man killed my family.""""Indeed he did.""""Why?""""Does it matter? You're never going to tell anyone.""""Then it's no skin off your nose to tell me, is it?""The white-haired man barked a laugh. ""Hah! Funny boy. What I want to know is, how have you lived in a graveyard for thirteen years without anyone catching wise?""""I'll answer your question if you answer mine.""The bull-necked man said, ""You don't talk to Mr. Dandy like that, little snot! I split you, I will-""The white-haired man took another step closer to the grave. ""Hush, Jack Tar. All right. An answer for an answer. We-my friends and I-are members of a fraternal organization, known as the Jacks of All Trades, or the Knaves, or by other names. We go back an extremely long way. We know...we remember things that most people have forgotten. The Old Knowledge.""Bod said, ""Magic. You know a little magic.""The man nodded agreeably. ""If you want to call it that. But it is a very specific sort of magic. There's a magic you take from death. Something leaves the world, something else comes into it.""""You killed my family for-for what? For magic powers? That's ridiculous.""""No. We killed you for protection. Long time ago, one of our people-this was back in Egypt, in pyramid days-he foresaw that one day, there would be a child born who would walk the borderland between the living and the dead. That if this child grew to adulthood it would mean the end of our order and all we stand for. We had people casting nativities before London was a village, we had your family in our sights before New Amsterdam became New York. And we sent what we thought was the best and the sharpest and the most dangerous of all the Jacks to deal with you. To do it properly, so we could take all the bad Juju and make it work for us instead, and keep everything tickety-boo for another five thousand years. Only he didn't.""Bod looked at the three men.""So where is he? Why isn't he here?""The blond man said, ""We can take care of you. He's got a good nose on him, has our Jack Frost. He's on the trail of your little girlfriend. Can't leave any witnesses. Not to something like this.""Bod leaned forward, dug his hands into the wild weed-grass that grew on the unkempt grave.""Come and get me,"" was all that he said.The blond man grinned, the bull-necked man lunged, and-yes-even Mr. Dandy took several steps forward.Bod pushed his fingers as deeply as he could into the grass, and he pulled his lips back from his teeth, and he said three words in a language that was already ancient before the Indigo Man was born.""Skagh! Thegh! Khavagah!""He opened the ghoul-gate.The grave swung up like a trapdoor. In the deep hole below the door Bod could see stars, a darkness filled with glimmering lights.The bull-man, Mr. Tar, at the edge of the hole, could not stop, and stumbled, surprised, into the darkness.Mr. Nimble jumped toward Bod, his arms extended, leaping over the hole. Bod watched as the man stopped in the air at the zenith of his spring, and hung there for a moment, before he was sucked through the ghoul-gate, down and down.Mr. Dandy stood at the edge of the ghoul-gate, on a lip of stone and looked down into the darkness beneath. Then he raised his eyes to Bod, and thin-lipped, he smiled.""I don't know what you just did,"" said Mr. Dandy. ""But it didn't work."" He pulled his gloved hand out of his pocket, holding a gun, pointed directly at Bod. ""I should have just done this thirteen years ago,"" said Mr. Dandy. ""You can't trust other people. If it's important, you have to do it yourself.""A desert wind came up from the open ghoul-gate, hot and dry, with grit in it. Bod said, ""There's a desert down there. If you look for water, you should find some. There's things to eat if you look hard, but don't antagonize the night-gaunts. Avoid Ghûlheim. The ghouls might wipe your memories and make you into one of them, or they might wait until you've rotted down, and then eat you. Either way, you can do better.""The gun barrel did not waver. Mr. Dandy said, ""Why are you telling me this?""Bod pointed across the graveyard. ""Because of them,"" he said, and as he said it, as Mr. Dandy glanced away, only for a moment, Bod Faded. Mr. Dandy's eyes flickered away and back, but Bod was no longer by the broken statue. From deep in the hole something called, like the lonely wail of a night bird.Mr. Dandy looked around, his forehead a slash, his body a mass of indecision and rage. ""Where are you?"" he growled. ""The Deuce take you! Where are you?""He thought he heard a voice say, ""Ghoul-gates are made to be opened and then closed again. You can't leave them open. They want to close.""The lip of the hole shuddered and shook. Mr. Dandy had been in an earthquake once, years before, in Bangladesh. It felt like that: the earth juddered, and Mr. Dandy fell, would have fallen into the darkness, but he caught hold of the fallen headstone, threw his arms about it and locked on. He did not know what was beneath him, only that he had no wish to find out.The earth shook, and he felt the headstone begin to shift, beneath his weight.He looked up. The boy was there, looking down at him curiously.""I'm going to let the gate close now,"" he said. ""I think if you keep holding onto that thing, it might close on you, and crush you, or it might just absorb you and make you into part of the gate. Don't know. But I'm giving you a chance, more than you ever gave my family.""A ragged judder. Mr. Dandy looked up into the boy's grey eyes, and he swore. Then he said, ""You can't ever escape us. We're the Jacks of All Trades. We're everywhere. It's not over.""""It is for you,"" said Bod. ""The end of your people and all you stand for. Like your man in Egypt predicted. You didn't kill me. You were everywhere. Now it's all over."" Then Bod smiled. ""That's what Silas is doing, isn't it? That's where he is.""Mr. Dandy's face confirmed everything that Bod had suspected.And what Mr. Dandy might have said to that, Bod would never know, because the man let go of the headstone and tumbled slowly down into the open ghoul-gate.Bod said, ""Wegh Khârados.""The ghoul-gate was a grave once again, nothing more.Something was tugging at his sleeve. Fortinbras Bartleby looked up at him. ""Bod! The man by the chapel. He's going up the hill.""The man Jack followed his nose. He had left the others, not least because the stink of Jack Dandy's cologne made finding anything subtler impossible.He could not find the boy by scent. Not here. The boy smelled like the graveyard. But the girl smelled like her mother's house, like the dab of perfume she had touched to her neck before school that morning. She smelled like a victim too, like fear-sweat, thought Jack, like his quarry. And wherever she was, the boy would be too, sooner or later.His hand closed around the handle of his knife and he walked up the hill. He was almost at the top of the hill when it occurred to him-a hunch he knew was a truth-that Jack Dandy and the rest of them were gone. Good, he thought. There's always room at the top. The man Jack's own rise through the Order had slowed and stopped after he had failed to kill all of the Dorian family. It was as if he had no longer been trusted.Now, soon, everything would change.At the top of the hill the man Jack lost the girl's scent. He knew she was near.He retraced his steps, almost casually, caught her perfume again about fifty feet away, beside a small mausoleum with a closed metal gateway. He pulled on the gate and it swung wide.Her scent was strong now. He could smell that she was afraid. He pulled down the coffins, one by one, from their shelves, and let them clatter onto the ground, shattering the old wood, spilling their contents onto the mausoleum floor. No, she was not hiding in any of those...Then where?He examined the wall. Solid. He went down on his hands and knees, pulled the last coffin out and reached back. His hand found an opening...""Scarlett,"" he called, trying to remember how he would have called her name when he was Mr. Frost, but he could not even find that part of himself any longer: he was the man Jack now, and that was all he was. On his hands and knees he crawled through the hole in the wall.When Scarlett heard the crashing noise from above she made her way, carefully, down the steps, her left hand touching the wall, her right hand holding the little LED keyring, which cast just enough light to allow her to see where she was placing her feet. She made it to the bottom of the stone steps and edged back in the open chamber, her heart thumping.She was scared: scared of nice Mr. Frost and his scarier friends; scared of this room and its memories; even, if she were honest, a little afraid of Bod. He was no longer a quiet boy with a mystery, a link to her childhood. He was something different, something not quite human.She thought, I wonder what Mum's thinking right now. She'll be phoning Mr. Frost's house over and over to find out when I'm going to get back. She thought, If I get out of this alive, I'm going to force her to get me a phone. It's ridiculous. I'm the only person in my year who doesn't have her own phone, practically.She thought, I miss my mum.She had not thought anyone human could move that silently through the dark, but a gloved hand closed upon her mouth, and a voice that was only barely recognizable as Mr. Frost's said, without emotion, ""Do anything clever-do anything at all-and I will cut your throat. Nod if you understand me.""Scarlett nodded.Bod saw the chaos on the floor of the Frobisher mausoleum, the fallen coffins with their contents scattered across over the aisle. There were many Frobishers and Frobyshers, and several Pettyfers, all in various states of upset and consternation.""He is already down there,"" said Ephraim.""Thank you,"" said Bod. He clambered through the hole into the inside of the hill, and he went down the stairs.Bod saw as the dead see: he saw the steps, and he saw the chamber at the bottom. And when he got halfway down the steps, he saw the man Jack holding Scarlett. He had her arm twisted up behind her back, and a large, wicked, boning-knife at her neck.The man Jack looked up in the darkness.""Hello, boy,"" he said.Bod said nothing. He concentrated on his Fade, took another step.""You think I can't see you,"" said the man Jack. ""And you're right. I can't. Not really. But I can smell your fear. And I can hear you move and hear you breathe. And now that I know about your clever vanishing trick, I can feel you. Say something now. Say it so I can hear it, or I start to cut little pieces out of the young lady. Do you understand me?""""Yes,"" said Bod, his voice echoing in the chamber room. ""I understand.""""Good,"" said Jack. ""Now, come here. Let's have a little chat.""Bod began to walk down the steps. He concentrated on the Fear, on raising the level of panic in the room, of making the Terror something tangible....""Stop that,"" said the man Jack. ""Whatever it is you're doing. Don't do it.""Bod let it go.""You think,"" said Jack, ""that you can do your little magics on me? Do you know what I am, boy?""Bod said, ""You're a Jack. You killed my family. And you should have killed me.""Jack raised an eyebrow. He said, ""I should have killed you?""""Oh yes. The old man said that if you let me grow to adulthood your Order would be destroyed. I did. You failed and you lost.""""My order goes back before Babylon. Nothing can harm it.""""They didn't tell you, did they?"" Bod was standing five paces from the man Jack. ""Those four. They were the last of the Jacks. What was it...Krakow and Vancouver and Melbourne. All gone.""Scarlett said, ""Please, Bod. Make him let go of me.""""Don't worry,"" said Bod, with a calm he did not feel. He said to Jack, ""There's no point in hurting her. There's no point in killing me. Don't you understand? There isn't even an order of Jacks of All Trades. Not anymore.""Jack nodded thoughtfully. ""If this is true,"" said Jack, ""and if I am now a Jack-all-alone, then I have an excellent reason for killing you both.""Bod said nothing.""Pride,"" said the man Jack. ""Pride in my work. Pride in finishing what I began."" And then he said, ""What are you doing?""Bod's hair prickled. He could feel a smoke-tendril presence twining through the room. He said, ""It's not me. It's the Sleer. It guards the treasure that's buried here.""""Don't lie.""Scarlett said, ""He's not lying. It's true.""Jack said, ""True? Buried treasure? Don't make me-""THE SLEER GUARDS THE TREASURE FOR THE MASTER.""Who said that?"" asked the man Jack, looking around.""You heard it?"" asked Bod, puzzled.""I heard it,"" said Jack. ""Yes.""Scarlett said, ""I didn't hear anything.""The man Jack said, ""What is this place, boy? Where are we?""Before Bod could speak, the Sleer's voice spoke, echoing through the chamber, THIS IS THE PLACE OF THE TREASURE. THIS IS THE PLACE OF POWER. THIS IS WHERE THE SLEER GUARDS AND WAITS FOR ITS MASTER TO RETURN.Bod said, ""Jack?""The man Jack tilted his head on one side. He said, ""It's good to hear my name in your mouth, boy. If you'd used it before, I could have found you sooner.""""Jack. What was my real name? What did my family call me?""""Why should that matter to you now?""Bod said, ""The Sleer told me to find my name. What was it?""Jack said, ""Let me see. Was it Peter? Or Paul? Or Roderick-you look like a Roderick. Maybe you were a Stephen..."" He was playing with the boy.""You might as well tell me. You're going to kill me anyway,"" said Bod. Jack shrugged and nodded in the darkness, as if to say obviously.""I want you to let the girl go,"" said Bod. ""Let Scarlett go.""Jack peered into the darkness, then said, ""That's an altar stone, isn't it?""""I suppose so.""""And a knife? And a cup? And a brooch?""He was smiling now, in the darkness. Bod could see it on his face: a strange, delighted smile that seemed out of place on that face, a smile of discovery and of understanding. Scarlett couldn't see anything but a blackness that sometimes erupted in flashes inside her eyeballs, but she could hear the delight in Jack's voice.The man Jack said, ""So the Brotherhood is over and the Convocation is at an end. And yet, if there are no more Jacks of All Trades but me, what does it matter? There can be a new Brotherhood, more powerful than the last.""POWER, echoed the Sleer.""This is perfect,"" said the man Jack. ""Look at us. We are in a place for which my people have hunted for thousands of years, with everything necessary for the ceremony waiting for us. It makes you believe in Providence, doesn't it? Or in the massed prayers of all the Jacks who have gone before us, that at our lowest ebb, we are given this.""Bod could feel the Sleer listening to Jack's words, could feel a low susurrus of excitement building in the chamber.The man Jack said, ""I am going to put out my hand, boy. Scarlett, my knife is still at your throat-do not try to run when I let go of you. Boy, you will place the cup and the knife and the brooch in my hand.""THE TREASURE OF THE SLEER, whispered the triple voice. IT ALWAYS COMES BACK. WE GUARD IT FOR THE MASTER.Bod bent down, took the objects from the altar stone, put them in Jack's open gloved hand. Jack grinned.""Scarlett. I am going to release you. When I take the knife away, I want you to lie, facedown, on the ground, with your hands behind your head. Move or try anything, and I will kill you painfully. Do you understand?""She gulped. Her mouth was dry, but she took one shaky step forward. Her right arm, which had been twisted up to the small of her back, was now numb, and she felt only pins and needles in her shoulder. She lay down, her cheek resting on the packed earth.We are dead, she thought, and it was not even tinged with emotion. It felt as if she were watching something happening to other people, a surreal drama that had turned into a game of Murder in the Dark. She heard the noise of Jack taking hold of Bod...Bod's voice said, ""Let her go.""The man Jack's voice: ""If you do everything I say, I won't kill her. I won't even hurt her.""""I don't believe you. She can identify you.""""No."" The adult voice seemed certain. ""She can't."" And then it said, ""Ten thousand years, and the knife is still sharp..."" The admiration in the voice was palpable. ""Boy. Go and kneel on that altar stone. Hands behind your back. Now.""IT HAS BEEN SO LONG, said the Sleer, but all Scarlett heard was a slithering noise, as if of enormous coils winding around the chamber.But the man Jack heard. ""You want to know your name, boy, before I spill your blood on the stone?""Bod felt the cold of the knife at his neck. And in that moment, Bod understood. Everything slowed. Everything came into focus. ""I know my name,"" he said. ""I'm Nobody Owens. That's who I am."" And, kneeling on the cold altar stone, it all seemed very simple.""Sleer,"" he said to the chamber. ""Do you still want a master?""THE SLEER GUARDS THE TREASURE UNTIL THE MASTER RETURNS.""Well,"" said Bod, ""haven't you finally found the master you've been looking for?""He could sense the Sleer writhing and expanding, hear a noise like the scratching of a thousand dead twigs, as if something huge and muscular were snaking its way around the inside of the chamber. And then, for the first time, Bod saw the Sleer. Afterwards, he was never able to describe what he had seen: something huge, yes; something with the body of an enormous snake, but with the head of a what...? There were three of them: three heads, three necks. The faces were dead, as if someone had constructed dolls from parts of the corpses of humans and of animals. The faces were covered in purple patterns, tattooed in swirls of indigo, turning the dead faces into strange, expressive monstrous things.The faces of the Sleer nuzzled the air about Jack tentatively, as if they wanted to stroke or caress him.""What's happening?"" said Jack. ""What is it? What does it do?""""It's called the Sleer. It guards the place. It needs a master to tell it what to do,"" said Bod.Jack hefted the flint knife in his hand. ""Beautiful,"" he said to himself. And then, ""Of course. It's been waiting for me. And yes. Obviously, I am its new master.""The Sleer encircled the interior of the chamber. MASTER? it said, like a dog who had waited patiently for too long. It said MASTER? again, as if testing the word to see how it tasted. And it tasted good, so it said one more time, with a sigh of delight and of longing, MASTER...Jack looked down at Bod. ""Thirteen years ago I missed you, and now, now we are reunited. The end of one order. The beginning of another. Good-bye, boy."" With one hand he lowered the knife to the boy's throat. The other hand held the goblet.""Bod,"" said Bod. ""Not Boy. Bod."" He raised his voice. ""Sleer,"" he said. ""What will you do with your new master?""The Sleer sighed. WE WILL PROTECT HIM UNTIL THE END OF TIME. THE SLEER WILL HOLD HIM IN ITS COILS FOREVER AND NEVER LET HIM ENDURE THE DANGERS OF THE WORLD.""Then protect him,"" said Bod. ""Now.""""I am your master. You will obey me,"" said the man Jack.THE SLEER HAS WAITED SO LONG, said the triple voice of the Sleer, triumphantly. SO LONG A TIME. It began to loop its huge, lazy coils around the man Jack.The man Jack dropped the goblet. Now he had a knife in each hand-a flint knife, and a knife with a black bone handle-and he said, ""Get back! Keep away from me! Don't get any closer!"" He slashed out with the knife, as the Sleer twined about him, and in a huge crushing movement, engulfed the man Jack in its coils.Bod ran over to Scarlett, and helped her up. ""I want to see,"" she said. ""I want to see what's happening."" She pulled out her LED light, and turned it on...What Scarlett saw was not what Bod saw. She did not see the Sleer, and that was a mercy. She saw the man Jack, though. She saw the fear on his face, which made him look like Mr. Frost had once looked. In his terror he was once more the nice man who had driven her home. He was floating in the air, five, then ten feet above the ground, slashing wildly at the air with two knives, trying to stab something she could not see, in a display that was obviously having no effect.Mr. Frost, the man Jack, whoever he was, was forced away from them, pulled back until he was spread-eagled, arms and legs wide and flailing, against the side of the chamber wall.It seemed to Scarlett that Mr. Frost was being forced through the wall, pulled into the rock, was being swallowed up by it. Now there was nothing visible but a face. He was shouting wildly, desperately, shouting at Bod to call the thing off, to save him, please, please...and then the man's face was pulled through the wall, and the voice was silenced.Bod walked back to the altar stone. He picked up the stone knife, and the goblet, and the brooch, from the ground and he replaced them where they belonged. He left the black metal knife where it fell.Scarlett said, ""I thought you said the Sleer couldn't hurt people. I thought all it could do was frighten us.""""Yes,"" said Bod. ""But it wanted a master to protect. It told me so.""Scarlett said, ""You mean you knew. You knew that would happen...""""Yes. I hoped it would.""He helped her up the steps and out into the chaos of the Frobisher mausoleum. ""I'll need to clean this all up,"" said Bod, casually. Scarlett tried not to look at the things on the floor.They stepped out into the graveyard. Scarlett said, dully, once more, ""You knew that would happen.""This time Bod said nothing.She looked at him as if unsure of what she was looking at. ""So you knew. That the Sleer would take him. Was that why you hid me down there? Was it? What was I, then, bait?""Bod said, ""It wasn't like that."" Then he said, ""We're still alive, aren't we? And he won't trouble us any longer.""Scarlett could feel the anger and the rage welling up inside her. The fear had gone, and now all she was left with was the need to lash out, to shout. She fought the urge. ""And what about those other men? Did you kill them too?""""I didn't kill anyone.""""Then where are they?""""One of them's at the bottom of a deep grave, with a broken ankle. The other three are, well, they're a long way away.""""You didn't kill them?""""Of course not."" Bod said, ""This is my home. Why would I want them hanging around here for the rest of time?"" Then, ""Look, it's okay. I dealt with them.""Scarlett took a step away from him. She said, ""You aren't a person. People don't behave like you. You're as bad as he was. You're a monster.""Bod felt the blood drain from his face. After everything he had been through that night, after everything that had happened, this was somehow the hardest thing to take. ""No,"" he said. ""It wasn't like that.""Scarlett began to back away from Bod.She took one step, two steps, and was about to flee, to turn and run madly, desperately away through the moonlit graveyard, when a tall man in black velvet put a hand on her arm, and said, ""I am afraid you do Bod an injustice. But you will undoubtedly be happier if you remember none of this. So let us walk together, you and I, and discuss what has happened to you over the last few days, and what it might be wise for you to remember, and what it might be better for you to forget.""Bod said, ""Silas. You can't. You can't make her forget me.""""It will be safest that way,"" said Silas, simply. ""For her, if not for all of us.""""Don't-don't I get a say in this?"" asked Scarlett.Silas said nothing. Bod took a step towards Scarlett, said, ""Look, it's over. I know it was hard. But. We did it. You and me. We beat them.""Her head was shaking gently, as if she was denying everything she saw, everything she was experiencing.She looked up at Silas, and said only, ""I want to go home. Please?""Silas nodded. He walked, with the girl, down the path that would eventually lead them both out of the graveyard. Bod stared at Scarlett as she walked away, hoping that she would turn and look back, that she would smile or just look at him without fear in her eyes. But Scarlett did not turn. She simply walked away.Bod went back into the mausoleum. He had to do something, so he began to pick up the fallen coffins, to remove the debris, and to replace the tangle of tumbled bones into the coffins, disappointed to discover that none of the many Frobishers and Frobyshers and Pettyfers gathered around to watch seemed to be quite certain whose bones belonged in which container.A man brought Scarlett home. Later, Scarlett's mother could not remember quite what he had told her, although disappointingly, she had learned that that nice Jay Frost had unavoidably been forced to leave town.The man talked with them, in the kitchen, about their lives and their dreams, and by the end of the conversation Scarlett's mother had somehow decided that they would be returning to Glasgow: Scarlett would be happy to be near her father, and to see her old friends again.Silas left the girl and her mother talking in the kitchen, discussing the challenges of moving back to Scotland, with Noona promising to buy Scarlett a phone of her own. They barely remembered that Silas had ever been there, which was the way he liked it.Silas returned to the graveyard and found Bod sitting in the amphitheater by the obelisk, his face set.""How is she?""""I took her memories,"" said Silas. ""They will return to Glasgow. She has friends there.""""How could you make her forget me?""Silas said, ""People want to forget the impossible. It makes their world safer.""Bod said, ""I liked her.""""I'm sorry.""Bod tried to smile, but he could not find a smile inside himself. ""The men...they spoke about trouble they were having in Krakow and Melbourne and Vancouver. That was you, wasn't it?""""I was not alone,"" said Silas.""Miss Lupescu?"" said Bod. Then, seeing the expression on his guardian's face, ""Is she all right?""Silas shook his head, and for a moment his face was terrible for Bod to behold. ""She fought bravely. She fought for you, Bod.""Bod said, ""The Sleer has the man Jack. Three of the others went through the ghoul-gate. There's one injured but still alive at the bottom of the Carstairs grave.""Silas said, ""He is the last of the Jacks. I will need to talk to him, then, before sunrise.""The wind that blew across the graveyard was cold, but neither the man nor the boy seemed to feel it.Bod said, ""She was scared of me.""""Yes.""""But why? I saved her life. I'm not a bad person. And I'm just like her. I'm alive too."" Then he said, ""How did Miss Lupescu fall?""""Bravely,"" said Silas. ""In battle. Protecting others.""Bod's eyes were dark. ""You could have brought her back here. Buried her here. Then I could have talked to her.""Silas said, ""That was not an option.""Bod felt his eyes stinging. He said, ""She used to call me Nimini. No one will ever call me that again.""Silas said, ""Shall we go and get food for you?""""We? You want me to come with you? Out of the graveyard?""Silas said, ""No one is trying to kill you. Not right now. There are a lot of things they are not going to be doing, not any longer. So, yes. What would you like to eat?""Bod thought about saying that he wasn't hungry, but that simply was not true. He felt a little sick, and a little lightheaded, and he was starving. ""Pizza?"" he suggested.They walked through the graveyard, down to the gates. As Bod walked, he saw the inhabitants of the graveyard, but they let the boy and his guardian pass among them without a word. They only watched.Bod tried to thank them for their help, to call out his gratitude, but the dead said nothing.The lights of the pizza restaurant were bright, brighter than Bod was comfortable with. He and Silas sat near the back, and Silas showed him how to use a menu, how to order food. (Silas ordered a glass of water and a small salad for himself, which he pushed around the bowl with his fork but never actually put to his lips.)Bod ate his pizza with his fingers and enthusiasm. He did not ask questions. Silas would talk in his own time, or he would not.Silas said, ""We had known of them...of the Jacks...for a long, long time, but we knew of them only from the results of their activities. We suspected there was an organization behind it, but they hid too well. And then they came after you, and they killed your family. And, slowly, I was able to follow their trail.""""Is we you and Miss Lupescu?"" asked Bod.""Us and others like us.""""The Honour Guard,"" said Bod.""How did you hear about-?"" said Silas. Then, ""No matter. Little pitchers have big ears, as they say. Yes. The Honour Guard."" Silas picked up his glass of water. He put the water glass to his lips, moistened them, then put it down on the polished black tabletop.The surface of the tabletop was almost mirrored, and, had anyone cared to look, they might have observed that the tall man had no reflection.Bod said, ""So. Now you're done...done with all this. Are you going to stay?""""I gave my word,"" said Silas. ""I am here until you are grown.""""I'm grown,"" said Bod.""No,"" said Silas. ""Almost. Not yet.""He put a ten-pound note down on the tabletop.""That girl,"" said Bod. ""Scarlett. Why was she so scared of me, Silas?""But Silas said nothing, and the question hung in the air as the man and the youth walked out of the bright pizza restaurant into the waiting darkness; and soon enough they were swallowed by the night.
TGB_ch8	TGB	The graveyard book	8	3053	16719	CHAPTER EIGHT - Leavings and PartingsSOMETIMES HE COULD NO longer see the dead. It had begun a month or two previously, in April or in May. At first it had only happened occasionally, but now it seemed to be happening more and more.The world was changing.Bod wandered over to the northwestern part of the graveyard, to the tangle of ivy that hung from a yew tree and half-blocked the far exit from the Egyptian Walk. He saw a red fox and a large black cat, with a white collar and paws, who sat conversing together in the middle of the path. At Bod's approach they looked up, startled, then fled into the undergrowth, as if they had been caught conspiring.Odd, he thought. He had known that fox since it had been a cub, and the cat had prowled through the graveyard for as long as Bod could remember. They knew him. If they were feeling friendly they even let him pet them.Bod started to slip through the ivy but he found his way blocked. He bent down, pushed the ivy out of the way and squeezed through. He walked down the path carefully, avoiding the ruts and holes until he reached the impressive stone that marked the final resting place of Alonso Tomás Garcia Jones (1837-1905, Traveler Lay Down Thy Staff).Bod had been coming down here every few days for several months: Alonso Jones had been all over the world, and he took great pleasure in telling Bod stories of his travels. He would begin by saying, ""Nothing interesting has ever happened to me,"" then would add, gloomily, ""and I have told you all my tales,"" and then his eyes would flash, and he would remark, ""Except...did I ever tell you about...?"" And whatever the next words were: ""The time I had to escape from Moscow?"" or ""The time I lost an Alaskan gold mine, worth a fortune?"" or ""The cattle stampede on the pampas?,"" Bod would always shake his head and look expectant and soon enough his head would be swimming with tales of derring-do and high adventure, tales of beautiful maidens kissed, of evildoers shot with pistols or fought with swords, of bags of gold, of diamonds as big as the tip of your thumb, of lost cities and of vast mountains, of steam-trains and clipper ships, of pampas, oceans, deserts, tundra.Bod walked over to the pointed stone-tall, carved with upside-down torches, and he waited, but saw no one. He called to Alonso Jones, even knocked on the side of the stone, but there was no response. Bod leaned down, to push his head into the grave and call his friend, but instead of his head slipping though the solid matter like a shadow passing through a deeper shadow, his head met the ground with a hard and painful thump. He called again, but saw nothing and no one, and, carefully, he made his way out of the tangle of greenery and of grey stones and back to the path. Three magpies perched in a hawthorn tree took wing as he passed them.He did not see another soul until he reached the graveyard's southwestern slope, where the familiar shape of Mother Slaughter, tiny in her high bonnet and her cloak, could be seen, walking between the gravestones, head bent, looking at wildflowers.""Here, boy!"" she called. ""There's nasturshalums growing wild over here. Why don't you pick some for me, and put them over by my stone.""So Bod picked the red and yellow nasturtiums, and he carried them over to Mother Slaughter's headstone, so cracked and worn and weathered that all it said now was,LAUGHwhich had puzzled the local historians for over a hundred years. He put down the flowers in front of the stone, respectfully.Mother Slaughter smiled at him. ""You're a good lad. I don't know what we'll do without you.""""Thank you,"" said Bod. Then, ""Where is everyone? You're the first person I've seen tonight.""Mother Slaughter peered at him sharply. ""What did you do to your forehead?"" she asked.""I bumped it, on Mr. Jones's grave. It was solid. I...""But Mother Slaughter was pursing her lips and tilting her head. Bright old eyes scrutinized Bod from beneath her bonnet. ""I called you boy, didn't I? But time passes in the blink of an eye, and it's a young man you are now, isn't it? How old are you?""""About fifteen, I think. Though I still feel the same as I always did,"" Bod said, but Mother Slaughter interrupted, ""And I still feels like I done when I was a tiny slip of a thing, making daisy chains in the old pasture. You're always you, and that don't change, and you're always changing, and there's nothing you can do about it.""She sat down on her broken stone, and said, ""I remember you the night you came here, boy. I says, 'We can't let the little fellow leave,' and your mother agrees, and all of them starts argufying and what-not until the Lady on the Grey rides up. 'People of the Graveyard,' she says, 'Listen to Mother Slaughter. Have you not got any charity in your bones?' and then all of them agreed with me."" She trailed off, shook her little head, ""There's not much happens here to make one day unlike the next. The seasons change. The ivy grows. Stones fall over. But you coming here...well, I'm glad you did, that's all.""She stood up and pulled a grubby piece of linen from her sleeve, spat on it, and reached up as high as she could and scrubbed the blood from Bod's forehead. ""There, that ought to make you look presentable,"" she said, severely. ""Seeing as I don't know when next I'll see you, anyway. Keep safe.""Feeling discomfited in a way he could not remember having felt before, Bod made his way back to the Owenses' tomb, and was pleased to see both of his parents waiting for him beside it. As he got closer, his pleasure turned into concern: why did Mr. and Mrs. Owens stand like that, arranged on each side of the tomb like characters from a stained-glass window? He could not read their faces.His father took a step forward and said, ""Evening, Bod. I trust you are keeping well.""""Tolerably well,"" said Bod, which was what Mr. Owens always said to his friends when they asked him the same question.Mr. Owens said, ""Mistress Owens and I spent our lives wishing that we had a child. I do not believe that we could have ever had a better young man than you, Bod."" He looked up at his son with pride.Bod said, ""Well, yes, thank you, but..."" He turned to his mother, certain he could get her to tell him what was happening, but she was no longer there. ""Where did she go?""""Oh. Yes."" Mr. Owens seemed ill at ease. ""Ah, you know Betsy. There's things, times. When, well, you don't know what to say. You know?""""No,"" said Bod.""I expect Silas is waiting for you,"" said his father, and then he was gone.It was past midnight. Bod began to walk toward the old chapel. The tree that grew out of the gutter on the spire had fallen in the last storm, taking a handful of the slate-black roof tiles with it.Bod waited on the grey wooden bench, but there was no sign of Silas.The wind gusted. It was late on a summer's night, when the twilight lasts forever, and it was warm, but still, Bod felt goose-pimples rising on his arms.A voice by his ear said, ""Say you'll miss me, you lump-kin.""""Liza?"" said Bod. He had not seen or heard from the witch-girl for over a year-not since the night of the Jacks of All Trades. ""Where have you been?""""Watching,"" she said. ""Does a lady have to tell everything she does?""""Watching me?"" asked BodLiza's voice, close to his ear, said, ""Truly, life is wasted on the living, Nobody Owens. For one of us is too foolish to live, and it is not I. Say you will miss me.""""Where are you going?"" asked Bod. Then, ""Of course I will miss you, wherever you go...""""Too stupid,"" whispered Liza Hempstock's voice, and he could feel the touch of her hand on his hand. ""Too stupid to live."" The touch of her lips against his cheek, against the corner of his lips. She kissed him gently and he was too perplexed, too utterly wrong-footed, to know what to do.Her voice said, ""I will miss you too. Always."" A breath of wind ruffled his hair, if it was not the touch of her hand, and then he was, he knew, alone on the bench.He got up.Bod walked over to the chapel door, lifted the stone beside the porch and pulled out the spare key, left there by a long-dead sexton. He unlocked the big wooden door without even testing to see if he could slip through it. It creaked open, protesting.The inside of the chapel was dark, and Bod found himself squinting as he tried to see.""Come in, Bod."" It was Silas's voice.""I can't see anything,"" said Bod. ""It's too dark.""""Already?"" said Silas. He sighed. Bod heard a velvet rustle, then a match was struck, and it flamed, and was used to light two huge candles that sat on great carved wooden candlesticks at the back of the room. In the candlelight, Bod could see his guardian standing beside a large leather chest, of the kind they call a steamer trunk-big enough that a tall man could have curled up and slept inside it. Beside it was Silas's black leather bag, which Bod had seen before, on a handful of occasions, but which he still found impressive.The steamer trunk was lined with whiteness. Bod put a hand into the empty trunk, touched the silk lining, touched dried earth.""Is this where you sleep?"" he asked.""When I am far from my house, yes,"" said Silas.Bod was taken aback: Silas had been here as long as he could remember and before. ""Isn't this your home?""Silas shook his head. ""My house is a long, long way from here,"" said Silas. ""That is, if it is still habitable. There have been problems in my native land, and I am far from certain what I will find on my return.""""You're going back?"" asked Bod. Things that had been immutable were changing. ""You're really leaving? But. You're my guardian.""""I was your guardian. But you are old enough to guard yourself. I have other things to protect.""Silas closed the lid of the brown leather trunk, and began to do up the straps and the buckles.""Can't I stay here? In the graveyard?""""You must not,"" said Silas, more gently than Bod could remember him ever saying anything. ""All the people here have had their lives, Bod, even if they were short ones. Now it's your turn. You need to live.""""Can I come with you?""Silas shook his head.""Will I see you again?""""Perhaps."" There was kindness in Silas's voice, and something more. ""And whether you see me or not, I have no doubt that I will see you."" He put the leather trunk against the wall, walked over to the door in the far corner. ""Follow me."" Bod walked behind Silas, followed him down the small spiral staircase to the crypt. ""I took the liberty of packing a case for you,"" Silas explained, as they reached the bottom.On top of the box of mildewed hymn books was a small leather suitcase, a miniature twin to Silas's own. ""Your possessions are all in there,"" said Silas.Bod said, ""Tell me about the Honour Guard, Silas. You're in it. Miss Lupescu was. Who else? Are there a lot of you? What do you do?""""We don't do enough,"" said Silas. ""And mostly, we guard the borderlands. We protect the borders of things.""""What kind of borders?""Silas said nothing.""You mean like stopping the man Jack and his people?""Silas said, ""We do what we have to."" He sounded weary.""But you did the right thing. I mean, stopping the Jacks. They were terrible. They were monsters.""Silas took a step closer to Bod, which made the youth tilt back his head to look up at the tall man's pale face. Silas said, ""I have not always done the right thing. When I was younger...I did worse things than Jack. Worse than any of them. I was the monster, then, Bod, and worse than any monster.""It did not even cross Bod's mind to wonder if his guardian was lying or joking. He knew that he was being told the truth. He said, ""But you aren't that any longer, are you?""Silas said, ""People can change,"" and then fell silent. Bod wondered if his guardian-if Silas-was remembering. Then, ""It was an honor to be your guardian, young man."" His hand vanished inside his cloak, reappeared holding a battered old wallet. ""This is for you. Take it.""Bod took the wallet, but did not open it.""It contains money. Enough to give you a start in the world, but nothing more.""Bod said, ""I went to see Alonso Jones today but he wasn't there, or if he was I couldn't see him. I wanted him to tell me about distant places he'd visited. Islands and porpoises and glaciers and mountains. Places where people dress and eat in the strangest ways."" Bod hesitated. Then, ""Those places. They're still there. I mean, there's a whole world out there. Can I see it? Can I go there?""Silas nodded. ""There is a whole world out there, yes. You have a passport in the inner pocket of your suitcase. It's made out in the name of Nobody Owens. And was not easy to obtain.""Bod said, ""If I change my mind can I come back here?"" And then he answered his own question. ""If I come back, it will be a place, but it won't be home any longer.""Silas said, ""Would you like me to walk you to the front gate?""Bod shook his head. ""Best if I do it on my own. Um. Silas. If you're ever in trouble, call me. I'll come and help.""""I,"" said Silas, ""do not get into trouble.""""No. I don't suppose you do. But still.""It was dark in the crypt, and it smelled of mildew and damp and old stones, and it seemed, for the first time, very small.Bod said, ""I want to see life. I want to hold it in my hands. I want to leave a footprint on the sand of a desert island. I want to play football with people. I want,"" he said, and then he paused and he thought. ""I want everything.""""Good,"" said Silas. Then he put up his hand as if he were brushing away the hair from his eyes-a most uncharacteristic gesture. He said, ""If ever it transpires that I am in trouble, I shall indeed send for you.""""Even though you don't get into trouble?""""As you say.""There was something at the edge of Silas's lips that might have been a smile, and might have been regret, and might just have been a trick of the shadows.""Good-bye, then, Silas."" Bod held out his hand, as he had when he was a small boy, and Silas took it, in a cold hand the color of old ivory, and shook it gravely.""Good-bye, Nobody Owens.""Bod picked up the little suitcase. He opened the door to let himself out of the crypt, walked back up the gentle slope to the path without looking back.It was well after the gates were locked. He wondered as he reached them if the gates would still let him walk through them, or if he would have to go back into the chapel to get a key, but when he got to the entrance he found the small pedestrian gate was unlocked and wide open, as if it was waiting for him, as if the graveyard itself was bidding him good-bye.One pale, plump figure waited in front of the open gate, and she smiled up at him as he came towards her, and there were tears in her eyes in the moonlight.""Hullo, Mother,"" said Bod.Mistress Owens rubbed her eyes with a knuckle, then dabbed at them with her apron, and she shook her head. ""Do you know what you're going to do now?"" she asked.""See the world,"" said Bod. ""Get into trouble. Get out of trouble again. Visit jungles and volcanoes and deserts and islands. And people. I want to meet an awful lot of people.""Mistress Owens made no immediate reply. She stared up at him, and then she began to sing a song that Bod remembered, a song she used to sing him when he was a tiny thing, a song that she had used to lull him to sleep when he was small.""Sleep my little babby-ohSleep until you wakenWhen you wake you'll see the worldIf I'm not mistaken...""""You're not,"" whispered Bod. ""And I shall.""""Kiss a loverDance a measure,Find your nameAnd buried treasure...""Then the last lines of the song came back to Mistress Owens, and she sang them to her son.""Face your lifeIts pain, its pleasure,Leave no path untaken""""Leave no path untaken,"" repeated Bod. ""A difficult challenge, but I can try my best.""He tried to put his arms around his mother then, as he had when he was a child, although he might as well have been trying to hold mist, for he was alone on the path.He took a step forward, through the gate that took him out of the graveyard. He thought a voice said, ""I am so proud of you, my son,"" but he might, perhaps, have imagined it.The midsummer sky was already beginning to lighten in the east, and that was the way that Bod began to walk: down the hill, towards the living people, and the city, and the dawn.There was a passport in his bag, money in his pocket. There was a smile dancing on his lips, although it was a wary smile, for the world is a bigger place than a little graveyard on a hill; and there would be dangers in it and mysteries, new friends to make, old friends to rediscover, mistakes to be made and many paths to be walked before he would, finally, return to the graveyard or ride with the Lady on the broad back of her great grey stallion.But between now and then, there was Life; and Bod walked into it with his eyes and his heart wide open.
